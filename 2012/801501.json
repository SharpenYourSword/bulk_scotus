CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA,\n                      ET AL.\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIANA\n\n     No. 11–161.      Argued February 29, 2012—Decided June 4, 2012\nFor decades, Indianapolis (City) funded sewer projects using Indiana’s\n  Barrett Law, which permitted cities to apportion a public improve-\n  ment project’s costs equally among all abutting lots. Under that sys-\n  tem, a city would create an initial assessment, dividing the total es-\n  timated cost by the number of lots and making any necessary\n  adjustments. Upon a project’s completion, the city would issue a final\n  lot-by-lot assessment. Lot owners could elect to pay the assessment\n  in a lump sum or over time in installments.\n    After the City completed the Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers\n  Project, it sent affected homeowners formal notice of their payment\n  obligations. Of the 180 affected homeowners, 38 elected to pay the\n  lump sum. The following year, the City abandoned Barrett Law fi-\n  nancing and adopted the Septic Tank Elimination Program (STEP),\n  which financed projects in part through bonds, thereby lowering indi-\n  vidual owner’s sewer-connection costs. In implementing STEP, the\n  City’s Board of Public Works enacted a resolution forgiving all as-\n  sessment amounts still owed pursuant to Barrett Law financing.\n  Homeowners who had paid the Brisbane/Manning Project lump sum\n  received no refund, while homeowners who had elected to pay in in-\n  stallments were under no obligation to make further payments.\n    The 38 homeowners who paid the lump sum asked the City for a\n  refund, but the City denied the request. Thirty-one of these home-\n  owners brought suit in Indiana state court claiming, in relevant part,\n  that the City’s refusal violated the Federal Equal Protection Clause.\n  The trial court granted summary judgment to the homeowners, and\n  the State Court of Appeals affirmed. The Indiana Supreme Court re-\n  versed, holding that the City’s distinction between those who had al-\n  ready paid and those who had not was rationally related to its legiti-\n2                     ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    mate interests in reducing administrative costs, providing financial\n    hardship relief to homeowners, transitioning from the Barrett Law\n    system to STEP, and preserving its limited resources.\nHeld: The City had a rational basis for its distinction and thus did not\n violate the Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 6–14.\n    (a) The City’s classification does not involve a fundamental right or\n suspect classification. See Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319–320. Its\n subject matter is local, economic, social, and commercial. See United\n States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152. It is a tax classi-\n fication. See Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461\n U. S. 540, 547. And no one claims that the City has discriminated\n against out-of-state commerce or new residents. Cf. Hooper v. Berna-\n lillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612. Hence, the City’s distinction\n does not violate the Equal Protection Clause as long as “there is any\n reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational ba-\n sis for the classification,” FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508\n U. S. 307, 313, and the “ ‘burden is on the one attacking the [classifi-\n cation] to negative every conceivable basis which might support it,’ ”\n Heller, supra, at 320. Pp. 6–7.\n    (b) Administrative concerns can ordinarily justify a tax-related dis-\n tinction, see, e.g., Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U. S.\n 495, 511–512, and the City’s decision to stop collecting outstanding\n Barrett Law debts finds rational support in the City’s administrative\n concerns. After the City switched to the STEP system, any decision\n to continue Barrett Law debt collection could have proved complex\n and expensive. It would have meant maintaining an administrative\n system for years to come to collect debts arising out of 20-plus differ-\n ent construction projects built over the course of a decade, involving\n monthly payments as low as $25 per household, with the possible\n need to maintain credibility by tracking down defaulting debtors and\n bringing legal action. The rationality of the City’s distinction draws\n further support from the nature of the line-drawing choices that con-\n fronted it. To have added refunds to forgiveness would have meant\n adding further administrative costs, namely the cost of processing re-\n funds. And limiting refunds only to Brisbane/Manning homeowners\n would have led to complaints of unfairness, while expanding refunds\n to the apparently thousands of other Barrett Law project homeown-\n ers would have involved an even greater administrative burden. Fi-\n nally, the rationality of the distinction draws support from the fact\n that the line that the City drew—distinguishing past payments from\n future obligations—is well known to the law. See, e.g., 26 U. S. C.\n §108(a)(1)(E). Pp. 7–10.\n    (c) Petitioners’ contrary arguments are unpersuasive. Whether fi-\n nancial hardship is a factor supporting rationality need not be con-\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  sidered here, since the City’s administrative concerns are sufficient to\n  show a rational basis for its distinction. Petitioners propose other\n  forgiveness systems that they argue are superior to the City’s system,\n  but the Constitution only requires that the line actually drawn by the\n  City be rational. Petitioners further argue that administrative con-\n  siderations alone should not justify a tax distinction lest a city justify\n  an unfair system through insubstantial administrative considera-\n  tions. Here it was rational for the City to draw a line that avoided\n  the administrative burden of both collecting and paying out small\n  sums for years to come. Petitioners have not shown that the admin-\n  istrative concerns are too insubstantial to justify the classification.\n  Finally, petitioners argue that precedent makes it more difficult for\n  the City to show a rational basis, but the cases to which they refer\n  involve discrimination based on residence or length of residence. The\n  one exception, Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Commission of Web-\n  ster Cty., 488 U. S. 336, is distinguishable. Pp. 10–14.\n946 N.

CITY\n\n       OF INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, ET AL. \n\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                       INDIANA\n\n                                [June 4, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  For many years, an Indiana statute, the “Barrett Law,”\nauthorized Indiana’s cities to impose upon benefited lot\nowners the cost of sewer improvement projects. The Law\nalso permitted those lot owners to pay either immediately\nin the form of a lump sum or over time in installments.\nIn 2005, the city of Indianapolis (City) adopted a new as-\nsessment and payment method, the “STEP” plan, and it\nforgave any Barrett Law installments that lot owners had\nnot yet paid.\n  A group of lot owners who had already paid their entire\nBarrett Law assessment in a lump sum believe that the\nCity should have provided them with equivalent refunds.\nAnd we must decide whether the City’s refusal to do so un-\nconstitutionally discriminates against them in violation\nof the Equal Protection Clause, Amdt. 14, §1. We hold\nthat the City had a rational basis for distinguishing be­\ntween those lot owners who had already paid their share\nof project costs and those who had not. And we conclude\nthat there is no equal protection violation.\n2                ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Beginning in 1889 Indiana’s Barrett Law permitted\ncities to pay for public improvements, such as sewage proj-\nects, by “apportion[ing]” the costs of a project “equally\namong all abutting lands or lots.” Ind. Code §36–9–39–\n15(b)(3) (2011); see Town Council of New Harmony v.\nParker, 726 N. E. 2d 1217, 1227, n. 13 (Ind. 2000) (proj­\nect’s beneficiaries pay its costs). When a city built a Bar­\nrett Law project, the city’s public works board would\ncreate an initial lot-owner assessment by “dividing the\nestimated total cost of the sewage works by the total num­\nber of lots.” §36–9–39–16(a). It might then adjust an\nindividual assessment downward if the lot would benefit\nless than would others. §36–9–39–17(b). Upon completion\nof the project, the board would issue a final lot-by-lot\nassessment.\n   The Law permitted lot owners to pay the assessment\neither in a single lump sum or over time in installment\npayments (with interest). The City would collect install­\nment payments “in the same manner as other taxes.”\n§36–9–37–6. The Law authorized 10-, 20-, or 30-year\ninstallment plans. §36–9–37–8.5(a). Until fully paid, an\nassessment would constitute a lien against the property,\npermitting the city to initiate foreclosure proceedings in\ncase of a default. §§36–9–37–9(b), –22.\n   For several decades, Indianapolis used the Barrett Law\nsystem to fund sewer projects. See, e.g., Conley v. Brum-\nmit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ind. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 621, 176 N. E. 880, 881 (1931) (in\nbanc). But in 2005, the City adopted a new system, called\nthe Septic Tank Elimination Program (STEP), which fi-\nnanced projects in part through bonds, thereby lowering in­\ndividual lot owners’ sewer-connection costs. By that time,\nthe City had constructed more than 40 Barrett Law\nprojects. App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a. We are told that\ninstallment-paying lot owners still owed money in respect\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto 24 of those projects. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 16–\n17, n. 3 (citing City’s Response to Plaintiff ’s Brief on\nDamages, Record in Cox v. Indianapolis, No. 1:09–cv–0435\n(SD Ind., Doc. 98–1 (Exh. A)). In respect to 21 of the\n24, some installment payments had not yet fallen due; in\nrespect to the other 3, those who owed money were in\ndefault. Reply Brief for Petitioners 17, n. 3.\n                            B\n  This case concerns one of the 24 still-open Barrett Law\nprojects, namely the Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers\nProject. The Brisbane/Manning Project began in 2001. It\nconnected about 180 homes to the City’s sewage system.\nConstruction was completed in 2003. The Indianapolis\nBoard of Public Works held an assessment hearing in\nJune 2004. And in July 2004 the Board sent the 180\naffected homeowners a formal notice of their payment\nobligations.\n  The notice made clear that each homeowner could pay\nthe entire assessment—$9,278 per property—in a lump\nsum or in installments, which would include interest at a\n3.5% annual rate. Under an installment plan, payments\nwould amount to $77.27 per month for 10 years; $38.66\nper month for 20 years; or $25.77 per month for 30 years.\nIn the event, 38 homeowners chose to pay up front; 47\nchose the 10-year plan; 27 chose the 20-year plan; and 68\nchose the 30-year plan. And in the first year each home­\nowner paid the amount due ($9,278 upfront; $927.80\nunder the 10-year plan; $463.90 under the 20-year plan, or\n$309.27 under the 30-year plan). App. to Pet. for Cert.\n48a.\n  The next year, however, the City decided to abandon the\nBarrett Law method of financing. It thought that the\nBarrett Law’s lot-by-lot payments had become too burden­\nsome for many homeowners to pay, discouraging changes\nfrom less healthy septic tanks to healthier sewer systems.\n4                ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee id., at 4a–5a. (For example, homes helped by the\nBrisbane/Manning Project, at a cost of more than $9,000\neach, were then valued at $120,000 to $270,000. App. 67.)\nThe City’s new STEP method of financing would charge\neach connecting lot owner a flat $2,500 fee and make up\nthe difference by floating bonds eventually paid for by all\nlot owners citywide. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, n. 5.\n   On October 31, 2005, the City enacted an ordinance\nimplementing its decision. In December, the City’s Board\nof Public Works enacted a further resolution, Resolution\n101, which, as part of the transition, would “forgive all\nassessment amounts . . . established pursuant to the Bar­\nrett Law Funding for Municipal Sewer programs due and\nowing from the date of November 1, 2005 forward.” App.\n72 (emphasis added). In its preamble, the Resolution said\nthat the Barrett Law “may present financial hardships on\nmany middle to lower income participants who most need\nsanitary sewer service in lieu of failing septic systems”;\nit pointed out that the City was transitioning to the new\nSTEP method of financing; and it said that the STEP\nmethod was based upon a financial model that had “con­\nsidered the current assessments being made by partici­\npants in active Barrett Law projects” as well as future\nprojects. Id., at 71–72. The upshot was that those who\nstill owed Barrett Law assessments would not have to\nmake further payments but those who had already paid\ntheir assessments would not receive refunds. This meant\nthat homeowners who had paid the full $9,278 Brisbane/\nManning Project assessment in a lump sum the preced-\ning year would receive no refund, while homeowners\nwho had elected to pay the assessment in installments, and\nhad paid a total of $309.27, $463.90, or $927.80, would\nbe under no obligation to make further payments.\n   In February 2006, the 38 homeowners who had paid the\nfull Brisbane/Manning Project assessment asked the City\nfor a partial refund (in an amount equal to the smallest\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nforgiven Brisbane/Manning installment debt, apparently\n$8,062). The City denied the request in part because\n“[r]efunding payments made in your project area, or any\nportion of the payments, would establish a precedent of\nunfair and inequitable treatment to all other property\nowners who have also paid Barrett Law assessments . . .\nand while [the November 1, 2005, cutoff date] might seem\narbitrary to you, it is essential for the City to establish\nthis date and move forward with the new funding ap­\nproach.” Id., at 50–51.\n                              C\n   Thirty-one of the thirty-eight Brisbane/Manning Project\nlump-sum homeowners brought this lawsuit in Indiana\nstate court seeking a refund of about $8,000 each. They\nclaimed in relevant part that the City’s refusal to provide\nthem with refunds at the same time that the City forgave\nthe outstanding Project debts of other Brisbane/Manning\nhomeowners violated the Federal Constitution’s Equal Pro-\ntection Clause, Amdt. 14, §1; see also Rev. Stat. §1979,\n42 U. S. C. §1983. The trial court granted summary\njudgment in their favor. The State Court of Appeals af­\nfirmed that judgment. 918 N. E. 2d 401 (2009). But the\nIndiana Supreme Court reversed. 946 N. E. 2d 553 (2011).\nIn its view, the City’s distinction between those who had\nalready paid their Barrett Law assessments and those\nwho had not was “rationally related to its legitimate inter­\nests in reducing its administrative costs, providing relief\nfor property owners experiencing financial hardship,\nestablishing a clear transition from [the] Barrett Law to\nSTEP, and preserving its limited resources.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 19a. We granted certiorari to consider the equal\nprotection question. And we now affirm the Indiana Su­\npreme Court.\n6                ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   As long as the City’s distinction has a rational basis,\nthat distinction does not violate the Equal Protection\nClause. This Court has long held that “a classification\nneither involving fundamental rights nor proceeding along\nsuspect lines . . . cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection\nClause if there is a rational relationship between the dis-\nparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental\npurpose.” Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319–320 (1993); cf.\nGulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150, 155, 165–166\n(1897). We have made clear in analogous contexts that,\nwhere “ordinary commercial transactions” are at issue, ra-\ntional basis review requires deference to reasonable under­\nlying legislative judgments. United States v. Carolene\nProducts Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152 (1938) (due process);\nsee also New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976)\n(per curiam) (equal protection). And we have repeatedly\npointed out that “[l]egislatures have especially broad\nlatitude in creating classifications and distinctions in tax\nstatutes.” Regan v. Taxation With Representation of\nWash., 461 U. S. 540, 547 (1983); see also Fitzgerald v.\nRacing Assn. of Central Iowa, 539 U. S. 103, 107–108\n(2003); Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11 (1992);\nLehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356,\n359 (1973); Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83, 87–88\n(1940); Citizens’ Telephone Co. of Grand Rapids v. Fuller,\n229 U. S. 322, 329 (1913).\n   Indianapolis’ classification involves neither a “funda­\nmental right” nor a “suspect” classification. Its subject\nmatter is local, economic, social, and commercial. It is a\ntax classification. And no one here claims that Indianapo­\nlis has discriminated against out-of-state commerce or new\nresidents. Cf. Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472\nU. S. 612 (1985); Williams v. Vermont, 472 U. S. 14 (1985);\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (1985);\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nZobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55 (1982). Hence, this case\nfalls directly within the scope of our precedents holding\nsuch a law constitutionally valid if “there is a plausible\npolicy reason for the classification, the legislative facts\non which the classification is apparently based rationally\nmay have been considered to be true by the governmental\ndecisionmaker, and the relationship of the classification to\nits goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction\narbitrary or irrational.” Nordlinger, supra, at 11 (citations\nomitted). And it falls within the scope of our precedents\nholding that there is such a plausible reason if “there is\nany reasonably conceivable state of facts that could pro­\nvide a rational basis for the classification.” FCC v. Beach\nCommunications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313 (1993); see also\nLindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U. S. 61, 78\n(1911).\n    Moreover, analogous precedent warns us that we are not\nto “pronounc[e]” this classification “unconstitutional un­\nless in the light of the facts made known or generally\nassumed it is of such a character as to preclude the as­\nsumption that it rests upon some rational basis within\nthe knowledge and experience of the legislators.” Carolene\nProducts Co., supra, at 152 (due process claim). Further,\nbecause the classification is presumed constitutional, the\n“ ‘ burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrange­\nment to negative every conceivable basis which might\nsupport it.’ ” Heller, supra, at 320 (quoting Lehnhausen,\nsupra, at 364).\n                             B\n   In our view, Indianapolis’ classification has a rational\nbasis. Ordinarily, administrative considerations can jus-\ntify a tax-related distinction. See, e.g., Carmichael v.\nSouthern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U. S. 495, 511–512 (1937)\n(tax exemption for businesses with fewer than eight em­\nployees rational in light of the “[a]dministrative conven­\n8                 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nience and expense” involved); see also Lehnhausen, supra,\nat 365 (comparing administrative cost of taxing corpora­\ntions versus individuals); Madden, supra, at 90 (compar­\ning administrative cost of taxing deposits in local banks\nversus those elsewhere). And the City’s decision to stop\ncollecting outstanding Barrett Law debts finds rational\nsupport in related administrative concerns.\n   The City had decided to switch to the STEP system.\nAfter that change, to continue Barrett Law unpaid-debt\ncollection could have proved complex and expensive. It\nwould have meant maintaining an administrative system\nthat for years to come would have had to collect debts\narising out of 20-plus different construction projects built\nover the course of a decade, involving monthly payments\nas low as $25 per household, with the possible need\nto maintain credibility by tracking down defaulting debt­\nors and bringing legal action. The City, for example,\nwould have had to maintain its Barrett Law operation\nwithin the City Controller’s Office, keep files on old, small,\ninstallment-plan debts, and (a City official says) possibly\nspend hundreds of thousands of dollars keeping computer­\nized debt-tracking systems current. See Brief for Interna­\ntional City/County Management Association et al. as\nAmici Curiae 13, n. 12 (citing Affidavit of Charles White\n¶13, Record in Cox, Doc. No. 57–3). Unlike the collection\nsystem prior to abandonment, the City would not have\nadded any new Barrett Law installment-plan debtors.\nAnd that fact means that it would have had to spread the\nfixed administrative costs of collection over an ever­\ndeclining number of debtors, thereby continuously increas­\ning the per-debtor cost of collection.\n   Consistent with these facts, the Director of the City’s\nDepartment of Public Works later explained that the City\ndecided to forgive outstanding debt in part because “[t]he\nadministrative costs to service and process remaining\nbalances on Barrett Law accounts long past the transition\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto the STEP program would not benefit the taxpayers” and\nwould defeat the purpose of the transition. App. 76. The\nfour other members of the City’s Board of Public Works\nhave said the same. See Affidavit of Gregory Taylor ¶6,\nRecord in Cox, Doc. No. 57–5; Affidavit of Kipper Tew ¶6,\nibid. Doc. No. 57–6; Affidavit of Susan Schalk ¶6, ibid.\nDoc. No. 57–7; Affidavit of Roger Brown ¶6, ibid. Doc.\nNo. 57–8.\n   The rationality of the City’s distinction draws further\nsupport from the nature of the line-drawing choices that\nconfronted it. To have added refunds to forgiveness would\nhave meant adding yet further administrative costs,\nnamely the cost of processing refunds. At the same time,\nto have tried to limit the City’s costs and lost revenues by\nlimiting forgiveness (or refund) rules to Brisbane/Manning\nhomeowners alone would have led those involved in other\nBarrett Law projects to have justifiably complained about\nunfairness. Yet to have granted refunds (as well as pro-\nviding forgiveness) to all those involved in all Barrett\nLaw projects (there were more than 40 projects) or in\nall open projects (there were more than 20) would have\ninvolved even greater administrative burden. The City\ncould not just “cut . . . checks,” post, at 4 (ROBERTS, C. J.,\ndissenting), without taking funding from other programs\nor finding additional revenue. If, instead, the City had\ntried to keep the amount of revenue it lost constant (a\nrational goal) but spread it evenly among the apparently\nthousands of homeowners involved in any of the Barrett\nLaws projects, the result would have been yet smaller\nindividual payments, even more likely to have been too\nsmall to justify the administrative expense.\n   Finally, the rationality of the distinction draws support\nfrom the fact that the line that the City drew—\ndistinguishing past payments from future obligations—is\na line well known to the law. Sometimes such a line takes\nthe form of an amnesty program, involving, say, mortgage\n10                ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npayments, taxes, or parking tickets. E.g., 26 U. S. C.\n§108(a)(1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (federal income tax\nprovision allowing homeowners to omit from gross income\nnewly forgiven home mortgage debt); United States v.\nMartin, 523 F. 3d 281, 284 (CA4 2008) (tax amnesty pro­\ngram whereby State newly forgave penalties and liabili­\nties if taxpayer satisfied debt); Horn v. Chicago, 860 F. 2d\n700, 704, n. 9 (CA7 1988) (city parking ticket amnesty\nprogram whereby outstanding tickets could be newly set­\ntled for a fraction of amount specified). This kind of\nline is consistent with the distinction that the law often\nmakes between actions previously taken and those yet to\ncome.\n                              C\n   Petitioners’ contrary arguments are not sufficient to\nchange our conclusion. Petitioners point out that the\nIndiana Supreme Court also listed a different considera­\ntion, namely “financial hardship,” as one of the factors\nsupporting rationality. App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a. They\nrefer to the City’s resolution that said that the Barrett\nLaw “may present financial hardships on many middle to\nlower income participants who most need sanitary sewer\nservice in lieu of failing septic systems.” App. 71. And\nthey argue that the tax distinction before us would not\nnecessarily favor low-income homeowners.\n   We need not consider this argument, however, for the\nadministrative considerations we have mentioned are\nsufficient to show a rational basis for the City’s distinc­\ntion. The Indiana Supreme Court wrote that the City’s\nclassification was “rationally related” in part “to its legit­\nimate interests in reducing its administrative costs.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 19a (emphasis added). The record of the\nCity’s proceedings is consistent with that determination.\nSee App. 72 (when developing transition, the City “consid­\nered the current assessments being made by participants\nin active Barrett Law projects”). In any event, a legisla­\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nture need not “actually articulate at any time the purpose\nor rationale supporting its classification.” Nordlinger, 505\nU. S., at 15; see also Fitzgerald, 539 U. S., at 108 (similar).\nRather, the “burden is on the one attacking the legislative\narrangement to negative every conceivable basis which\nmight support it.” Madden, 309 U. S., at 88; see Heller,\n509 U. S., at 320 (same); Lehnhausen, 410 U. S., at 364\n(same); see also Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358\nU. S. 522, 530 (1959) (upholding state tax classification\nresting “upon a state of facts that reasonably can be con­\nceived” as creating a rational distinction). Petitioners\nhave not “negative[d]” the Indiana Supreme Court’s first\nlisted justification, namely the administrative concerns we\nhave discussed.\n   Petitioners go on to propose various other forgiveness\nsystems that would have included refunds for at least\nsome of those who had already paid in full. They argue\nthat those systems are superior to the system that the\nCity chose. We have discussed those, and other possible,\nsystems earlier. Supra, at 8–9. Each has advantages and\ndisadvantages. But even if petitioners have found a supe­\nrior system, the Constitution does not require the City to\ndraw the perfect line nor even to draw a line superior to\nsome other line it might have drawn. It requires only that\nthe line actually drawn be a rational line. And for the\nreasons we have set forth in Part II–B, supra, we believe\nthat the line the City drew here is rational.\n   Petitioners further argue that administrative considera­\ntions alone should not justify a tax distinction, lest a city\narbitrarily allocate taxes among a few citizens while for­\ngiving many similarly situated citizens on the ground that\nit is cheaper and easier to collect taxes from a few people\nthan from many. Brief for Petitioners 45. Petitioners are\nright that administrative considerations could not justify\nsuch an unfair system. But that is not because adminis­\ntrative considerations can never justify tax differences\n12               ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(any more than they can always do so). The question is\nwhether reducing those expenses, in the particular cir­\ncumstances, provides a rational basis justifying the tax\ndifference in question.\n   In this case, “in the light of the facts made known or\ngenerally assumed,” Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S., at\n152, it is reasonable to believe that to graft a refund sys­\ntem onto the City’s forgiveness decision could have (for\nexample) imposed an administrative burden of both col­\nlecting and paying out small sums (say, $25 per month) for\nyears. As we have said, supra, at 7–9, it is rational for the\nCity to draw a line that avoids that burden. Petitioners,\nwho are the ones “attacking the legislative arrangement,”\nhave the burden of showing that the circumstances are\notherwise, i.e., that the administrative burden is too in­\nsubstantial to justify the classification. That they have\nnot done.\n   Finally, petitioners point to precedent that in their view\nmakes it more difficult than we have said for the City to\nshow a “rational basis.” With but one exception, however,\nthe cases to which they refer involve discrimination based\non residence or length of residence. E.g., Hooper v. Berna-\nlillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612 (state tax preference\ndistinguishing between long-term and short-term resident\nveterans); Williams v. Vermont, 472 U. S. 14 (state use tax\nthat burdened out-of-state car buyers who moved in-state);\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (state\nlaw that taxed out-of-state insurance companies at a\nhigher rate than in-state companies); Zobel v. Williams,\n457 U. S. 55 (state dividend distribution system that\nfavored long-term residents). But those circumstances are\nnot present here.\n   The exception consists of Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co.\nv. Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989). The\nCourt there took into account a state constitution and\nrelated laws that required equal valuation of equally\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvaluable property. Id., at 345. It considered the constitu­\ntionality of a county tax assessor’s practice (over a period\nof many years) of determining property values as of the\ntime of the property’s last sale; that practice meant highly\nunequal valuations for two identical properties that were\nsold years or decades apart. Id., at 341. The Court first\nfound that the assessor’s practice was not rationally re­\nlated to the county’s avowed purpose of assessing proper­\nties equally at true current value because of the intentional\nsystemic discrepancies the practice created. Id., at 343–\n344. The Court then noted that, in light of the state con­\nstitution and related laws requiring equal valuation, there\ncould be no other rational basis for the practice. Id., at\n344–345. Therefore, the Court held, the assessor’s dis­\ncriminatory policy violated the Federal Constitution’s\ninsistence upon “equal protection of the law.” Id., at 346.\n   Petitioners argue that the City’s refusal to add refunds\nto its forgiveness decision is similar, for it constitutes a\nrefusal to apply “equally” an Indiana state law that says\nthat the costs of a Barrett Law project shall be equally\n“apportioned.” Ind. Code §36–9–39–15(b)(3). In other\nwords, petitioners say that even if the City’s decision\nmight otherwise be related to a rational purpose, state law\n(as in Allegheny) makes this the rare case where the facts\npreclude any rational basis for the City’s decision other\nthan to comply with the state mandate of equality.\n   Allegheny, however, involved a clear state law require­\nment clearly and dramatically violated. Indeed, we have\ndescribed Allegheny as “the rare case where the facts\nprecluded” any alternative reading of state law and thus\nany alternative rational basis. Nordlinger, 505 U. S., at\n16. Here, the City followed state law by apportioning the\ncost of its Barrett Law projects equally. State law says\nnothing about forgiveness, how to design a forgiveness\nprogram, or whether or when rational distinctions in doing\nso are permitted. To adopt petitioners’ view would risk\n14              ARMOUR v.

CITY\n\n       OF INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, ET AL. \n\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                       INDIANA\n\n                        [June 4, 2012]\n\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA\nand JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.\n  Twenty-three years ago, we released a succinct and\nunanimous opinion striking down a property tax scheme\nin West Virginia on the ground that it clearly violated the\nEqual Protection Clause. Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co.\nv. Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989). In\nAllegheny Pittsburgh, we held that a county failed to\ncomport with equal protection requirements when it as-\nsessed property taxes primarily on the basis of purchase\nprice, with no appropriate adjustments over time. The\nresult was that new property owners were assessed at\n“roughly 8 to 35 times” the rate of those who had owned\ntheir property longer. Id., at 344. We found such a “gross\ndisparit[y]” in tax levels could not be justified in a state\nsystem that demanded that “taxation . . . be equal and\nuniform.” Id., at 338; W. Va. Const., Art. X, §1. The case\naffirmed the common-sense proposition that the Equal\nProtection Clause is violated by state action that deprives\na citizen of even “rough equality in tax treatment,” when\nstate law itself specifically provides that all the affected\ntaxpayers are in the same category for tax purposes. 488\nU. S., at 343; see Hillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U. S. 620,\n623 (1946) (“The equal protection clause . . . protects the\nindividual from state action which selects him out for\n2                ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ndiscriminatory treatment by subjecting him to taxes not\nimposed on others of the same class”).\n  In this case, the Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers\nProject allowed 180 property owners to have their homes\nhooked up to the City of Indianapolis’s sewer system un-\nder the State’s Barrett Law. That law requires sewer\ncosts to “be primarily apportioned equally among all abut-\nting lands or lots.” Ind. Code §36–9–39–15(b)(3) (2011).\nIn the case of Brisbane/Manning, the cost came to $9,278\nfor each property owner. Some of the property owners—\npetitioners here—paid the full $9,278 up front. Others\nelected the option of paying in installments. Shortly after\nhook-up, the City switched to a new financing system and\ndecided to forgive the hook-up debts of those paying on\nan installment plan. The City refused, however, to refund\nany portion of the payments made by their identically sit-\nuated neighbors who had already paid the full amount\ndue. The result was that while petitioners each paid the\nCity $9,278 for their hook-ups, more than half their neigh-\nbors paid less than $500 for the same improvement—some\nas little as $309.27. Another quarter paid less than $1,000.\nPetitioners thus paid between 10 and 30 times as much\nfor their sewer hook-ups as their neighbors.\n  In seeking to justify this gross disparity, the City ex-\nplained that it was presented with three choices: First, it\ncould have continued to collect the installment plan pay-\nments of those who had not yet settled their debts under\nthe old system. Second, it could have forgiven all those\ndebts and given equivalent refunds to those who had made\nlump sum payments up front. Or third, it could have\nforgiven the future payments and not refunded payments\nthat had already been made. The first two choices had the\nbenefit of complying with state law, treating all of Indian-\napolis’s citizens equally, and comporting with the Consti-\ntution. The City chose the third option.\n  And what did the City believe was sufficient to justify a\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsystem that would effectively charge petitioners 30 times\nmore than their neighbors for the same service—when\nstate law promised equal treatment? Two things: the\ndesire to avoid administrative hassle and the “fiscal[] chal-\nleng[e]” of giving back money it wanted to keep. Brief for\nRespondents 35–36. I cannot agree that those reasons\npass constitutional muster, even under rational basis\nreview.\n   The City argues that either of the other options for\ntransitioning away from the Barrett Law would have been\n“immensely difficult from an administrative standpoint.”\nId., at 36. The Court accepts this rationale, observing that\n“[o]rdinarily, administrative considerations can justify a\ntax-related distinction.” Ante, at 7. The cases the Court\ncites, however, stand only for the proposition that a legis-\nlature crafting a tax scheme may take administrative\nconcerns into consideration when creating classes of tax-\nable entities that may be taxed differently. See, e.g.,\nLehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356,\n359 (1973) (a State may “draw lines that treat one class of\nindividuals or entities differently from the others”); Mad-\nden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83, 87 (1940) (referring to the\n“broad discretion as to classification possessed by a legis-\nlature”); Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301\nU. S. 495, 510–511 (1937) (discussing permissible consid-\nerations for the legislature in establishing a tax scheme).\n   Here, however, Indiana’s tax scheme explicitly provides\nthat costs will “be primarily apportioned equally among\nall abutting lands or lots.” Ind. Code §36–9–39–15(b)(3)\n(emphasis added). The legislature has therefore decreed\nthat all abutting landowners are within the same class.\nWe have never before held that administrative burdens\njustify grossly disparate tax treatment of those the State\nhas provided should be treated alike. Indeed, in Allegheny\nPittsburgh the County argued that its unequal assess-\nments were based on “[a]dministrative cost[ ]” concerns, to\n4                ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nno avail. Brief for Respondent, O. T. 1988, No. 87–1303,\np. 22. The reason we have rejected this argument is obvi-\nous: The Equal Protection Clause does not provide that no\nState shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\nequal protection of the laws, unless it’s too much of a\nbother.”\n   Even if the Court were inclined to decide that adminis-\ntrative burdens alone may sometimes justify grossly dis-\nparate treatment of members of the same class, this would\nhardly be the case to do that. The City claims it cannot\nissue refunds because the process would be too difficult,\nrequiring that it pore over records of old projects to deter-\nmine which homeowners had overpaid and by how much.\nBrief for Respondents 36. But holding that the City must\nrefund petitioners’ overpayments would not mean that it\nhas to refund overpayments in every Barrett Law project.\nThe Equal Protection Clause is concerned with “gross” dis-\nparity in taxing. Because the Brisbane/Manning project\nwas initiated shortly before the Barrett Law transition,\nthe disparity between what petitioners paid in compar-\nison to their installment plan neighbors was dramatic.\nNot so with respect to, for example, a project initiated 10\nyears earlier, because for those projects even installment\nplan payers will have largely satisfied their debts, result-\ning in far less significant disparities.\n   To the extent a ruling for petitioners would require\nissuing refunds to others who overpaid under the Barrett\nLaw, I think the city workers are up to the task. The City\nhas in fact already produced records showing exactly how\nmuch each lump-sum payer overpaid in every active Bar-\nrett Law Project—to the penny. Record in Cox v. Indian-\napolis, No. 1:09–cv–0435 (SD Ind.), Doc. 98–1 (Exh. A).\nWhat the city employees would need to do, therefore, is cut\nthe checks and mail them out.\n   Certainly the job need not involve the complicated pro-\ncedure the Court describes in an attempt to bolster its\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nadministrative convenience argument. Under the Court’s\nview the City would apparently continue to accept month-\nly payments from installment plan homeowners in order\nto gradually repay the money it owes to those who paid in\na lump sum. Ante, at 9, 12. But this approach was never\ndreamt of by the City itself. See Brief for Respondents 18\n(setting out City’s “three basic [transition] options,” none\nof which involved the Court’s gradual refund scheme).\n   The Court suggests that the City’s administrative con-\nvenience argument is one with which the law is comfort-\nable. The Court compares the City’s decision to forgive\nthe installment balances to the sort of parking ticket and\nmortgage payment amnesty programs that currently\nabound. Ante, at 9. This analogy is misplaced: Amnesty\nprograms are designed to entice those who are unlikely\never to pay their debts to come forward and pay at least a\nportion of what they owe. It is not administrative conven-\nience alone that justifies such schemes. In a sense, these\nschemes help remedy payment inequities by prompting\nthose who would pay nothing to pay at least some of their\nfair share. The same cannot be said of the City’s system.\n   The Court is willing to concede that “administrative\nconsiderations could not justify . . . an unfair system” in\nwhich “a city arbitrarily allocate[s] taxes among a few\ncitizens while forgiving many others on the ground that it\nis cheaper and easier to collect taxes from a few people\nthan from many.” Ante, at 11. Cold comfort, that. If the\nquoted language does not accurately describe this case, I\nam not sure what it would reach.\n   The Court wisely does not embrace the City’s alterna-\ntive argument that the unequal tax burden is justified\nbecause “it would have been fiscally challenging to issue\nrefunds.” Brief for Respondents 35. “Fiscally challenging”\ngives euphemism a bad name. The City’s claim that it has\nalready spent petitioners’ money is hardly worth a re-\nsponse, and the City recognizes as much when it admits it\n6                 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncould provide refunds to petitioners by “arrang[ing] for\npayments from non-Barrett Law sources.” Id., at 36. One\ncannot evade returning money to its rightful owner by\nthe simple expedient of spending it. The “fiscal challenge”\njustification seems particularly inappropriate in this case,\nas the City—with an annual budget of approximately $900\nmillion—admits that the cost of refunding all of petition-\ners’ money would be approximately $300,000. Adopted\n2012 Budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis,\nMarion County (Oct. 17, 2011), p. 7; Tr. of Oral Arg. 17,\n58.\n   Equally unconvincing is the Court’s attempt to distin-\nguish Allegheny Pittsburgh. The Court claims that case\nwas different because it involved “a clear state law re-\nquirement clearly and dramatically violated.” Ante, at 14.\nNothing less is at stake here. Indiana law requires that\nthe costs of sewer projects be “apportioned equally among\nall abutting lands.” Ind. Code §36–9–39–15(b)(3). The\nCity has instead apportioned the costs of the Brisbane/\nManning project such that petitioners paid between 10 and\n30 times as much as their neighbors. Worse still, it\nhas done so in order to avoid administrative hassle and\nsave a bit of money. To paraphrase A Man for All Sea-\nsons: “It profits a city nothing to give up treating its citi-\nzens equally for the whole world . . . but for $300,000?”\nSee R. Bolt, A Man for All Seasons, act II, p. 158 (1st\nVintage Int’l ed. 1990).\n   Our precedents do not ask for much from government in\nthis area—only “rough equality in tax treatment.” Alle-\ngheny Pittsburgh, 488 U. S., at 343. The Court reminds us\nthat Allegheny Pittsburgh is a “rare case.” Ante, at 14. It\nis and should be; we give great leeway to taxing authori-\nties in this area, for good and sufficient reasons. But\nevery generation or so a case comes along when this Court\nneeds to say enough is enough, if the Equal Protection\nClause is to retain any force in this context. Allegheny\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          7\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nPittsburgh was such a case; so is this one. Indiana law\npromised neighboring homeowners that they would be\ntreated equally when it came to paying for sewer hook-\nups. The City then ended up charging some homeowners\n30 times what it charged their neighbors for the same\nhook-ups. The equal protection violation is plain. I would\naccordingly reverse the decision of the Indiana Supreme\nCourt, and respectfully dissent from the Court’s decision\nto do otherwise.\n</pre>", "id": 801501, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/06/04/armour_v._indianapolis.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued February 29, 2012—Decided June 4, 2012\nFor decades, Indianapolis (City) funded sewer projects using Indiana’s\n  Barrett Law, which permitted cities to apportion a public improve-\n  ment project’s costs equally among all abutting lots. Under that sys-\n  tem, a city would create an initial assessment, dividing the total es-\n  timated cost by the number of lots and making any necessary\n  adjustments. Upon a project’s completion, the city would issue a final\n  lot-by-lot assessment. Lot owners could elect to pay the assessment\n  in a lump sum or over time in installments.\n    After the City completed the Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers\n  Project, it sent affected homeowners formal notice of their payment\n  obligations. Of the 180 affected homeowners, 38 elected to pay the\n  lump sum. The following year, the City abandoned Barrett Law fi-\n  nancing and adopted the Septic Tank Elimination Program (STEP),\n  which financed projects in part through bonds, thereby lowering indi-\n  vidual owner’s sewer-connection costs. In implementing STEP, the\n  City’s Board of Public Works enacted a resolution forgiving all as-\n  sessment amounts still owed pursuant to Barrett Law financing.\n  Homeowners who had paid the Brisbane/Manning Project lump sum\n  received no refund, while homeowners who had elected to pay in in-\n  stallments were under no obligation to make further payments.\n    The 38 homeowners who paid the lump sum asked the City for a\n  refund, but the City denied the request. Thirty-one of these home-\n  owners brought suit in Indiana state court claiming, in relevant part,\n  that the City’s refusal violated the Federal Equal Protection Clause.\n  The trial court granted summary judgment to the homeowners, and\n  the State Court of Appeals affirmed. The Indiana Supreme Court re-\n  versed, holding that the City’s distinction between those who had al-\n  ready paid and those who had not was rationally related to its legiti-\n2                     ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    mate interests in reducing administrative costs, providing financial\n    hardship relief to homeowners, transitioning from the Barrett Law\n    system to STEP, and preserving its limited resources.\nHeld: The City had a rational basis for its distinction and thus did not\n violate the Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 6–14.\n    (a) The City’s classification does not involve a fundamental right or\n suspect classification. See Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319–320. Its\n subject matter is local, economic, social, and commercial. See United\n States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152. It is a tax classi-\n fication. See Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461\n U. S. 540, 547. And no one claims that the City has discriminated\n against out-of-state commerce or new residents. Cf. Hooper v. Berna-\n lillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612. Hence, the City’s distinction\n does not violate the Equal Protection Clause as long as “there is any\n reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational ba-\n sis for the classification,” FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508\n U. S. 307, 313, and the “ ‘burden is on the one attacking the [classifi-\n cation] to negative every conceivable basis which might support it,’ ”\n Heller, supra, at 320. Pp. 6–7.\n    (b) Administrative concerns can ordinarily justify a tax-related dis-\n tinction, see, e.g., Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U. S.\n 495, 511–512, and the City’s decision to stop collecting outstanding\n Barrett Law debts finds rational support in the City’s administrative\n concerns. After the City switched to the STEP system, any decision\n to continue Barrett Law debt collection could have proved complex\n and expensive. It would have meant maintaining an administrative\n system for years to come to collect debts arising out of 20-plus differ-\n ent construction projects built over the course of a decade, involving\n monthly payments as low as $25 per household, with the possible\n need to maintain credibility by tracking down defaulting debtors and\n bringing legal action. The rationality of the City’s distinction draws\n further support from the nature of the line-drawing choices that con-\n fronted it. To have added refunds to forgiveness would have meant\n adding further administrative costs, namely the cost of processing re-\n funds. And limiting refunds only to Brisbane/Manning homeowners\n would have led to complaints of unfairness, while expanding refunds\n to the apparently thousands of other Barrett Law project homeown-\n ers would have involved an even greater administrative burden. Fi-\n nally, the rationality of the distinction draws support from the fact\n that the line that the City drew—distinguishing past payments from\n future obligations—is well known to the law. See, e.g., 26 U. S. C.\n §108(a)(1)(E). Pp. 7–10.\n    (c) Petitioners’ contrary arguments are unpersuasive.

Petitioners propose other\n  forgiveness systems that they argue are superior to the City’s system,\n  but the Constitution only requires that the line actually drawn by the\n  City be rational. Petitioners further argue that administrative con-\n  siderations alone should not justify a tax distinction lest a city justify\n  an unfair system through insubstantial administrative considera-\n  tions. Here it was rational for the City to draw a line that avoided\n  the administrative burden of both collecting and paying out small\n  sums for years to come. Petitioners have not shown that the admin-\n  istrative concerns are too insubstantial to justify the classification.\n  Finally, petitioners argue that precedent makes it more difficult for\n  the City to show a rational basis, but the cases to which they refer\n  involve discrimination based on residence or length of residence.

CITY\n\n       OF INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, ET AL. \n\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                       INDIANA\n\n                                [June 4, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  For many years, an Indiana statute, the “Barrett Law,”\nauthorized Indiana’s cities to impose upon benefited lot\nowners the cost of sewer improvement projects. The Law\nalso permitted those lot owners to pay either immediately\nin the form of a lump sum or over time in installments.\nIn 2005, the city of Indianapolis (City) adopted a new as-\nsessment and payment method, the “STEP” plan, and it\nforgave any Barrett Law installments that lot owners had\nnot yet paid.\n  A group of lot owners who had already paid their entire\nBarrett Law assessment in a lump sum believe that the\nCity should have provided them with equivalent refunds.\nAnd we must decide whether the City’s refusal to do so un-\nconstitutionally discriminates against them in violation\nof the Equal Protection Clause, Amdt. 14, §1. We hold\nthat the City had a rational basis for distinguishing be­\ntween those lot owners who had already paid their share\nof project costs and those who had not. And we conclude\nthat there is no equal protection violation.\n2                ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Beginning in 1889 Indiana’s Barrett Law permitted\ncities to pay for public improvements, such as sewage proj-\nects, by “apportion[ing]” the costs of a project “equally\namong all abutting lands or lots.” Ind. Code §36–9–39–\n15(b)(3) (2011); see Town Council of New Harmony v.\nParker, 726 N. E. 2d 1217, 1227, n. 13 (Ind. 2000) (proj­\nect’s beneficiaries pay its costs). When a city built a Bar­\nrett Law project, the city’s public works board would\ncreate an initial lot-owner assessment by “dividing the\nestimated total cost of the sewage works by the total num­\nber of lots.” §36–9–39–16(a). It might then adjust an\nindividual assessment downward if the lot would benefit\nless than would others. §36–9–39–17(b). Upon completion\nof the project, the board would issue a final lot-by-lot\nassessment.\n   The Law permitted lot owners to pay the assessment\neither in a single lump sum or over time in installment\npayments (with interest). The City would collect install­\nment payments “in the same manner as other taxes.”\n§36–9–37–6. The Law authorized 10-, 20-, or 30-year\ninstallment plans. §36–9–37–8.5(a). Until fully paid, an\nassessment would constitute a lien against the property,\npermitting the city to initiate foreclosure proceedings in\ncase of a default. §§36–9–37–9(b), –22.\n   For several decades, Indianapolis used the Barrett Law\nsystem to fund sewer projects. See, e.g., Conley v. Brum-\nmit, 92 Ind. App. 620, 621, 176 N. E. 880, 881 (1931) (in\nbanc). But in 2005, the City adopted a new system, called\nthe Septic Tank Elimination Program (STEP), which fi-\nnanced projects in part through bonds, thereby lowering in­\ndividual lot owners’ sewer-connection costs. By that time,\nthe City had constructed more than 40 Barrett Law\nprojects. App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a. We are told that\ninstallment-paying lot owners still owed money in respect\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

See Reply Brief for Petitioners 16–\n17, n. 3 (citing City’s Response to Plaintiff ’s Brief on\nDamages, Record in Cox v. Indianapolis, No. 1:09–cv–0435\n(SD Ind., Doc. 98–1 (Exh. A)). In respect to 21 of the\n24, some installment payments had not yet fallen due; in\nrespect to the other 3, those who owed money were in\ndefault. Reply Brief for Petitioners 17, n. 3.\n                            B\n  This case concerns one of the 24 still-open Barrett Law\nprojects, namely the Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers\nProject. The Brisbane/Manning Project began in 2001. It\nconnected about 180 homes to the City’s sewage system.\nConstruction was completed in 2003. The Indianapolis\nBoard of Public Works held an assessment hearing in\nJune 2004. And in July 2004 the Board sent the 180\naffected homeowners a formal notice of their payment\nobligations.\n  The notice made clear that each homeowner could pay\nthe entire assessment—$9,278 per property—in a lump\nsum or in installments, which would include interest at a\n3.5% annual rate. Under an installment plan, payments\nwould amount to $77.27 per month for 10 years; $38.66\nper month for 20 years; or $25.77 per month for 30 years.\nIn the event, 38 homeowners chose to pay up front; 47\nchose the 10-year plan; 27 chose the 20-year plan; and 68\nchose the 30-year plan. And in the first year each home­\nowner paid the amount due ($9,278 upfront; $927.80\nunder the 10-year plan; $463.90 under the 20-year plan, or\n$309.27 under the 30-year plan). App. to Pet. for Cert.\n48a.\n  The next year, however, the City decided to abandon the\nBarrett Law method of financing. It thought that the\nBarrett Law’s lot-by-lot payments had become too burden­\nsome for many homeowners to pay, discouraging changes\nfrom less healthy septic tanks to healthier sewer systems.\n4                ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee id., at 4a–5a. (For example, homes helped by the\nBrisbane/Manning Project, at a cost of more than $9,000\neach, were then valued at $120,000 to $270,000. App. 67.)\nThe City’s new STEP method of financing would charge\neach connecting lot owner a flat $2,500 fee and make up\nthe difference by floating bonds eventually paid for by all\nlot owners citywide. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, n. 5.\n   On October 31, 2005, the City enacted an ordinance\nimplementing its decision. In December, the City’s Board\nof Public Works enacted a further resolution, Resolution\n101, which, as part of the transition, would “forgive all\nassessment amounts . . . established pursuant to the Bar­\nrett Law Funding for Municipal Sewer programs due and\nowing from the date of November 1, 2005 forward.” App.\n72 (emphasis added). In its preamble, the Resolution said\nthat the Barrett Law “may present financial hardships on\nmany middle to lower income participants who most need\nsanitary sewer service in lieu of failing septic systems”;\nit pointed out that the City was transitioning to the new\nSTEP method of financing; and it said that the STEP\nmethod was based upon a financial model that had “con­\nsidered the current assessments being made by partici­\npants in active Barrett Law projects” as well as future\nprojects. Id., at 71–72. The upshot was that those who\nstill owed Barrett Law assessments would not have to\nmake further payments but those who had already paid\ntheir assessments would not receive refunds. This meant\nthat homeowners who had paid the full $9,278 Brisbane/\nManning Project assessment in a lump sum the preced-\ning year would receive no refund, while homeowners\nwho had elected to pay the assessment in installments, and\nhad paid a total of $309.27, $463.90, or $927.80, would\nbe under no obligation to make further payments.\n   In February 2006, the 38 homeowners who had paid the\nfull Brisbane/Manning Project assessment asked the City\nfor a partial refund (in an amount equal to the smallest\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nforgiven Brisbane/Manning installment debt, apparently\n$8,062). The City denied the request in part because\n“[r]efunding payments made in your project area, or any\nportion of the payments, would establish a precedent of\nunfair and inequitable treatment to all other property\nowners who have also paid Barrett Law assessments . . .\nand while [the November 1, 2005, cutoff date] might seem\narbitrary to you, it is essential for the City to establish\nthis date and move forward with the new funding ap­\nproach.” Id., at 50–51.\n                              C\n   Thirty-one of the thirty-eight Brisbane/Manning Project\nlump-sum homeowners brought this lawsuit in Indiana\nstate court seeking a refund of about $8,000 each. They\nclaimed in relevant part that the City’s refusal to provide\nthem with refunds at the same time that the City forgave\nthe outstanding Project debts of other Brisbane/Manning\nhomeowners violated the Federal Constitution’s Equal Pro-\ntection Clause, Amdt. 14, §1; see also Rev. Stat. §1979,\n42 U. S. C. §1983. The trial court granted summary\njudgment in their favor. The State Court of Appeals af­\nfirmed that judgment. 918 N. E. 2d 401 (2009). But the\nIndiana Supreme Court reversed. 946 N. E. 2d 553 (2011).\nIn its view, the City’s distinction between those who had\nalready paid their Barrett Law assessments and those\nwho had not was “rationally related to its legitimate inter­\nests in reducing its administrative costs, providing relief\nfor property owners experiencing financial hardship,\nestablishing a clear transition from [the] Barrett Law to\nSTEP, and preserving its limited resources.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 19a. We granted certiorari to consider the equal\nprotection question. And we now affirm the Indiana Su­\npreme Court.\n6                ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   As long as the City’s distinction has a rational basis,\nthat distinction does not violate the Equal Protection\nClause. This Court has long held that “a classification\nneither involving fundamental rights nor proceeding along\nsuspect lines . . . cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection\nClause if there is a rational relationship between the dis-\nparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental\npurpose.” Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319–320 (1993); cf.\nGulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150, 155, 165–166\n(1897). We have made clear in analogous contexts that,\nwhere “ordinary commercial transactions” are at issue, ra-\ntional basis review requires deference to reasonable under­\nlying legislative judgments. United States v. Carolene\nProducts Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152 (1938) (due process);\nsee also New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976)\n(per curiam) (equal protection). And we have repeatedly\npointed out that “[l]egislatures have especially broad\nlatitude in creating classifications and distinctions in tax\nstatutes.” Regan v. Taxation With Representation of\nWash., 461 U. S. 540, 547 (1983); see also Fitzgerald v.\nRacing Assn. of Central Iowa, 539 U. S. 103, 107–108\n(2003); Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11 (1992);\nLehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356,\n359 (1973); Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83, 87–88\n(1940); Citizens’ Telephone Co. of Grand Rapids v. Fuller,\n229 U. S. 322, 329 (1913).\n   Indianapolis’ classification involves neither a “funda­\nmental right” nor a “suspect” classification. Its subject\nmatter is local, economic, social, and commercial. It is a\ntax classification. And no one here claims that Indianapo­\nlis has discriminated against out-of-state commerce or new\nresidents. Cf. Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472\nU. S. 612 (1985); Williams v. Vermont, 472 U. S. 14 (1985);\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (1985);\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nZobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55 (1982). Hence, this case\nfalls directly within the scope of our precedents holding\nsuch a law constitutionally valid if “there is a plausible\npolicy reason for the classification, the legislative facts\non which the classification is apparently based rationally\nmay have been considered to be true by the governmental\ndecisionmaker, and the relationship of the classification to\nits goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction\narbitrary or irrational.” Nordlinger, supra, at 11 (citations\nomitted). And it falls within the scope of our precedents\nholding that there is such a plausible reason if “there is\nany reasonably conceivable state of facts that could pro­\nvide a rational basis for the classification.” FCC v. Beach\nCommunications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313 (1993); see also\nLindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U. S. 61, 78\n(1911).\n    Moreover, analogous precedent warns us that we are not\nto “pronounc[e]” this classification “unconstitutional un­\nless in the light of the facts made known or generally\nassumed it is of such a character as to preclude the as­\nsumption that it rests upon some rational basis within\nthe knowledge and experience of the legislators.” Carolene\nProducts Co., supra, at 152 (due process claim). Further,\nbecause the classification is presumed constitutional, the\n“ ‘ burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrange­\nment to negative every conceivable basis which might\nsupport it.’ ” Heller, supra, at 320 (quoting Lehnhausen,\nsupra, at 364).\n                             B\n   In our view, Indianapolis’ classification has a rational\nbasis. Ordinarily, administrative considerations can jus-\ntify a tax-related distinction. See, e.g., Carmichael v.\nSouthern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U. S. 495, 511–512 (1937)\n(tax exemption for businesses with fewer than eight em­\nployees rational in light of the “[a]dministrative conven­\n8                 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nience and expense” involved); see also Lehnhausen, supra,\nat 365 (comparing administrative cost of taxing corpora­\ntions versus individuals); Madden, supra, at 90 (compar­\ning administrative cost of taxing deposits in local banks\nversus those elsewhere). And the City’s decision to stop\ncollecting outstanding Barrett Law debts finds rational\nsupport in related administrative concerns.\n   The City had decided to switch to the STEP system.\nAfter that change, to continue Barrett Law unpaid-debt\ncollection could have proved complex and expensive. It\nwould have meant maintaining an administrative system\nthat for years to come would have had to collect debts\narising out of 20-plus different construction projects built\nover the course of a decade, involving monthly payments\nas low as $25 per household, with the possible need\nto maintain credibility by tracking down defaulting debt­\nors and bringing legal action. The City, for example,\nwould have had to maintain its Barrett Law operation\nwithin the City Controller’s Office, keep files on old, small,\ninstallment-plan debts, and (a City official says) possibly\nspend hundreds of thousands of dollars keeping computer­\nized debt-tracking systems current. See Brief for Interna­\ntional City/County Management Association et al. as\nAmici Curiae 13, n. 12 (citing Affidavit of Charles White\n¶13, Record in Cox, Doc. No. 57–3). Unlike the collection\nsystem prior to abandonment, the City would not have\nadded any new Barrett Law installment-plan debtors.\nAnd that fact means that it would have had to spread the\nfixed administrative costs of collection over an ever­\ndeclining number of debtors, thereby continuously increas­\ning the per-debtor cost of collection.\n   Consistent with these facts, the Director of the City’s\nDepartment of Public Works later explained that the City\ndecided to forgive outstanding debt in part because “[t]he\nadministrative costs to service and process remaining\nbalances on Barrett Law accounts long past the transition\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto the STEP program would not benefit the taxpayers” and\nwould defeat the purpose of the transition. App. 76. The\nfour other members of the City’s Board of Public Works\nhave said the same. See Affidavit of Gregory Taylor ¶6,\nRecord in Cox, Doc. No. 57–5; Affidavit of Kipper Tew ¶6,\nibid. Doc. No. 57–6; Affidavit of Susan Schalk ¶6, ibid.\nDoc. No. 57–7; Affidavit of Roger Brown ¶6, ibid. Doc.\nNo. 57–8.\n   The rationality of the City’s distinction draws further\nsupport from the nature of the line-drawing choices that\nconfronted it. To have added refunds to forgiveness would\nhave meant adding yet further administrative costs,\nnamely the cost of processing refunds. At the same time,\nto have tried to limit the City’s costs and lost revenues by\nlimiting forgiveness (or refund) rules to Brisbane/Manning\nhomeowners alone would have led those involved in other\nBarrett Law projects to have justifiably complained about\nunfairness. Yet to have granted refunds (as well as pro-\nviding forgiveness) to all those involved in all Barrett\nLaw projects (there were more than 40 projects) or in\nall open projects (there were more than 20) would have\ninvolved even greater administrative burden. The City\ncould not just “cut . . . checks,” post, at 4 (ROBERTS, C. J.,\ndissenting), without taking funding from other programs\nor finding additional revenue. If, instead, the City had\ntried to keep the amount of revenue it lost constant (a\nrational goal) but spread it evenly among the apparently\nthousands of homeowners involved in any of the Barrett\nLaws projects, the result would have been yet smaller\nindividual payments, even more likely to have been too\nsmall to justify the administrative expense.\n   Finally, the rationality of the distinction draws support\nfrom the fact that the line that the City drew—\ndistinguishing past payments from future obligations—is\na line well known to the law. Sometimes such a line takes\nthe form of an amnesty program, involving, say, mortgage\n10                ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npayments, taxes, or parking tickets. E.g., 26 U. S. C.\n§108(a)(1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (federal income tax\nprovision allowing homeowners to omit from gross income\nnewly forgiven home mortgage debt); United States v.\nMartin, 523 F. 3d 281, 284 (CA4 2008) (tax amnesty pro­\ngram whereby State newly forgave penalties and liabili­\nties if taxpayer satisfied debt); Horn v. Chicago, 860 F. 2d\n700, 704, n. 9 (CA7 1988) (city parking ticket amnesty\nprogram whereby outstanding tickets could be newly set­\ntled for a fraction of amount specified). This kind of\nline is consistent with the distinction that the law often\nmakes between actions previously taken and those yet to\ncome.\n                              C\n   Petitioners’ contrary arguments are not sufficient to\nchange our conclusion. Petitioners point out that the\nIndiana Supreme Court also listed a different considera­\ntion, namely “financial hardship,” as one of the factors\nsupporting rationality. App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a. They\nrefer to the City’s resolution that said that the Barrett\nLaw “may present financial hardships on many middle to\nlower income participants who most need sanitary sewer\nservice in lieu of failing septic systems.” App. 71. And\nthey argue that the tax distinction before us would not\nnecessarily favor low-income homeowners.\n   We need not consider this argument, however, for the\nadministrative considerations we have mentioned are\nsufficient to show a rational basis for the City’s distinc­\ntion. The Indiana Supreme Court wrote that the City’s\nclassification was “rationally related” in part “to its legit­\nimate interests in reducing its administrative costs.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 19a (emphasis added). The record of the\nCity’s proceedings is consistent with that determination.\nSee App. 72 (when developing transition, the City “consid­\nered the current assessments being made by participants\nin active Barrett Law projects”). In any event, a legisla­\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

S., at 15; see also Fitzgerald, 539 U. S., at 108 (similar).\nRather, the “burden is on the one attacking the legislative\narrangement to negative every conceivable basis which\nmight support it.” Madden, 309 U. S., at 88; see Heller,\n509 U. S., at 320 (same); Lehnhausen, 410 U. S., at 364\n(same); see also Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358\nU. S. 522, 530 (1959) (upholding state tax classification\nresting “upon a state of facts that reasonably can be con­\nceived” as creating a rational distinction). Petitioners\nhave not “negative[d]” the Indiana Supreme Court’s first\nlisted justification, namely the administrative concerns we\nhave discussed.\n   Petitioners go on to propose various other forgiveness\nsystems that would have included refunds for at least\nsome of those who had already paid in full. They argue\nthat those systems are superior to the system that the\nCity chose. We have discussed those, and other possible,\nsystems earlier. Supra, at 8–9. Each has advantages and\ndisadvantages. But even if petitioners have found a supe­\nrior system, the Constitution does not require the City to\ndraw the perfect line nor even to draw a line superior to\nsome other line it might have drawn. It requires only that\nthe line actually drawn be a rational line. And for the\nreasons we have set forth in Part II–B, supra, we believe\nthat the line the City drew here is rational.\n   Petitioners further argue that administrative considera­\ntions alone should not justify a tax distinction, lest a city\narbitrarily allocate taxes among a few citizens while for­\ngiving many similarly situated citizens on the ground that\nit is cheaper and easier to collect taxes from a few people\nthan from many. Brief for Petitioners 45. Petitioners are\nright that administrative considerations could not justify\nsuch an unfair system. But that is not because adminis­\ntrative considerations can never justify tax differences\n12               ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(any more than they can always do so). The question is\nwhether reducing those expenses, in the particular cir­\ncumstances, provides a rational basis justifying the tax\ndifference in question.\n   In this case, “in the light of the facts made known or\ngenerally assumed,” Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S., at\n152, it is reasonable to believe that to graft a refund sys­\ntem onto the City’s forgiveness decision could have (for\nexample) imposed an administrative burden of both col­\nlecting and paying out small sums (say, $25 per month) for\nyears. As we have said, supra, at 7–9, it is rational for the\nCity to draw a line that avoids that burden. Petitioners,\nwho are the ones “attacking the legislative arrangement,”\nhave the burden of showing that the circumstances are\notherwise, i.e., that the administrative burden is too in­\nsubstantial to justify the classification. That they have\nnot done.\n   Finally, petitioners point to precedent that in their view\nmakes it more difficult than we have said for the City to\nshow a “rational basis.” With but one exception, however,\nthe cases to which they refer involve discrimination based\non residence or length of residence. E.g., Hooper v. Berna-\nlillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612 (state tax preference\ndistinguishing between long-term and short-term resident\nveterans); Williams v. Vermont, 472 U. S. 14 (state use tax\nthat burdened out-of-state car buyers who moved in-state);\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (state\nlaw that taxed out-of-state insurance companies at a\nhigher rate than in-state companies); Zobel v. Williams,\n457 U. S. 55 (state dividend distribution system that\nfavored long-term residents). But those circumstances are\nnot present here.\n   The exception consists of Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co.\nv. Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989). The\nCourt there took into account a state constitution and\nrelated laws that required equal valuation of equally\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvaluable property. Id., at 345. It considered the constitu­\ntionality of a county tax assessor’s practice (over a period\nof many years) of determining property values as of the\ntime of the property’s last sale; that practice meant highly\nunequal valuations for two identical properties that were\nsold years or decades apart. Id., at 341. The Court first\nfound that the assessor’s practice was not rationally re­\nlated to the county’s avowed purpose of assessing proper­\nties equally at true current value because of the intentional\nsystemic discrepancies the practice created. Id., at 343–\n344. The Court then noted that, in light of the state con­\nstitution and related laws requiring equal valuation, there\ncould be no other rational basis for the practice. Id., at\n344–345. Therefore, the Court held, the assessor’s dis­\ncriminatory policy violated the Federal Constitution’s\ninsistence upon “equal protection of the law.” Id., at 346.\n   Petitioners argue that the City’s refusal to add refunds\nto its forgiveness decision is similar, for it constitutes a\nrefusal to apply “equally” an Indiana state law that says\nthat the costs of a Barrett Law project shall be equally\n“apportioned.” Ind. Code §36–9–39–15(b)(3). In other\nwords, petitioners say that even if the City’s decision\nmight otherwise be related to a rational purpose, state law\n(as in Allegheny) makes this the rare case where the facts\npreclude any rational basis for the City’s decision other\nthan to comply with the state mandate of equality.\n   Allegheny, however, involved a clear state law require­\nment clearly and dramatically violated. Indeed, we have\ndescribed Allegheny as “the rare case where the facts\nprecluded” any alternative reading of state law and thus\nany alternative rational basis. Nordlinger, 505 U. S., at\n16. Here, the City followed state law by apportioning the\ncost of its Barrett Law projects equally. State law says\nnothing about forgiveness, how to design a forgiveness\nprogram, or whether or when rational distinctions in doing\nso are permitted. To adopt petitioners’ view would risk\n14              ARMOUR v.

CITY\n\n       OF INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, ET AL. \n\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                       INDIANA\n\n                        [June 4, 2012]\n\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA\nand JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.\n  Twenty-three years ago, we released a succinct and\nunanimous opinion striking down a property tax scheme\nin West Virginia on the ground that it clearly violated the\nEqual Protection Clause. Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co.\nv. Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989). In\nAllegheny Pittsburgh, we held that a county failed to\ncomport with equal protection requirements when it as-\nsessed property taxes primarily on the basis of purchase\nprice, with no appropriate adjustments over time. The\nresult was that new property owners were assessed at\n“roughly 8 to 35 times” the rate of those who had owned\ntheir property longer. Id., at 344. We found such a “gross\ndisparit[y]” in tax levels could not be justified in a state\nsystem that demanded that “taxation . . . be equal and\nuniform.” Id., at 338; W. Va. Const., Art. X, §1. The case\naffirmed the common-sense proposition that the Equal\nProtection Clause is violated by state action that deprives\na citizen of even “rough equality in tax treatment,” when\nstate law itself specifically provides that all the affected\ntaxpayers are in the same category for tax purposes. 488\nU. S., at 343; see Hillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U. S. 620,\n623 (1946) (“The equal protection clause . . . protects the\nindividual from state action which selects him out for\n2                ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ndiscriminatory treatment by subjecting him to taxes not\nimposed on others of the same class”).\n  In this case, the Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers\nProject allowed 180 property owners to have their homes\nhooked up to the City of Indianapolis’s sewer system un-\nder the State’s Barrett Law. That law requires sewer\ncosts to “be primarily apportioned equally among all abut-\nting lands or lots.” Ind. Code §36–9–39–15(b)(3) (2011).\nIn the case of Brisbane/Manning, the cost came to $9,278\nfor each property owner. Some of the property owners—\npetitioners here—paid the full $9,278 up front. Others\nelected the option of paying in installments. Shortly after\nhook-up, the City switched to a new financing system and\ndecided to forgive the hook-up debts of those paying on\nan installment plan. The City refused, however, to refund\nany portion of the payments made by their identically sit-\nuated neighbors who had already paid the full amount\ndue. The result was that while petitioners each paid the\nCity $9,278 for their hook-ups, more than half their neigh-\nbors paid less than $500 for the same improvement—some\nas little as $309.27. Another quarter paid less than $1,000.\nPetitioners thus paid between 10 and 30 times as much\nfor their sewer hook-ups as their neighbors.\n  In seeking to justify this gross disparity, the City ex-\nplained that it was presented with three choices: First, it\ncould have continued to collect the installment plan pay-\nments of those who had not yet settled their debts under\nthe old system. Second, it could have forgiven all those\ndebts and given equivalent refunds to those who had made\nlump sum payments up front. Or third, it could have\nforgiven the future payments and not refunded payments\nthat had already been made. The first two choices had the\nbenefit of complying with state law, treating all of Indian-\napolis’s citizens equally, and comporting with the Consti-\ntution. The City chose the third option.\n  And what did the City believe was sufficient to justify a\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsystem that would effectively charge petitioners 30 times\nmore than their neighbors for the same service—when\nstate law promised equal treatment? Two things: the\ndesire to avoid administrative hassle and the “fiscal[] chal-\nleng[e]” of giving back money it wanted to keep. Brief for\nRespondents 35–36. I cannot agree that those reasons\npass constitutional muster, even under rational basis\nreview.\n   The City argues that either of the other options for\ntransitioning away from the Barrett Law would have been\n“immensely difficult from an administrative standpoint.”\nId., at 36. The Court accepts this rationale, observing that\n“[o]rdinarily, administrative considerations can justify a\ntax-related distinction.” Ante, at 7. The cases the Court\ncites, however, stand only for the proposition that a legis-\nlature crafting a tax scheme may take administrative\nconcerns into consideration when creating classes of tax-\nable entities that may be taxed differently. See, e.g.,\nLehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356,\n359 (1973) (a State may “draw lines that treat one class of\nindividuals or entities differently from the others”); Mad-\nden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83, 87 (1940) (referring to the\n“broad discretion as to classification possessed by a legis-\nlature”); Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301\nU. S. 495, 510–511 (1937) (discussing permissible consid-\nerations for the legislature in establishing a tax scheme).\n   Here, however, Indiana’s tax scheme explicitly provides\nthat costs will “be primarily apportioned equally among\nall abutting lands or lots.” Ind. Code §36–9–39–15(b)(3)\n(emphasis added). The legislature has therefore decreed\nthat all abutting landowners are within the same class.\nWe have never before held that administrative burdens\njustify grossly disparate tax treatment of those the State\nhas provided should be treated alike. Indeed, in Allegheny\nPittsburgh the County argued that its unequal assess-\nments were based on “[a]dministrative cost[ ]” concerns, to\n4                ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nno avail. Brief for Respondent, O. T. 1988, No. 87–1303,\np. 22. The reason we have rejected this argument is obvi-\nous: The Equal Protection Clause does not provide that no\nState shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\nequal protection of the laws, unless it’s too much of a\nbother.”\n   Even if the Court were inclined to decide that adminis-\ntrative burdens alone may sometimes justify grossly dis-\nparate treatment of members of the same class, this would\nhardly be the case to do that. The City claims it cannot\nissue refunds because the process would be too difficult,\nrequiring that it pore over records of old projects to deter-\nmine which homeowners had overpaid and by how much.\nBrief for Respondents 36. But holding that the City must\nrefund petitioners’ overpayments would not mean that it\nhas to refund overpayments in every Barrett Law project.\nThe Equal Protection Clause is concerned with “gross” dis-\nparity in taxing. Because the Brisbane/Manning project\nwas initiated shortly before the Barrett Law transition,\nthe disparity between what petitioners paid in compar-\nison to their installment plan neighbors was dramatic.\nNot so with respect to, for example, a project initiated 10\nyears earlier, because for those projects even installment\nplan payers will have largely satisfied their debts, result-\ning in far less significant disparities.\n   To the extent a ruling for petitioners would require\nissuing refunds to others who overpaid under the Barrett\nLaw, I think the city workers are up to the task. The City\nhas in fact already produced records showing exactly how\nmuch each lump-sum payer overpaid in every active Bar-\nrett Law Project—to the penny. Record in Cox v. Indian-\napolis, No. 1:09–cv–0435 (SD Ind.), Doc. 98–1 (Exh. A).\nWhat the city employees would need to do, therefore, is cut\nthe checks and mail them out.\n   Certainly the job need not involve the complicated pro-\ncedure the Court describes in an attempt to bolster its\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nadministrative convenience argument. Under the Court’s\nview the City would apparently continue to accept month-\nly payments from installment plan homeowners in order\nto gradually repay the money it owes to those who paid in\na lump sum. Ante, at 9, 12. But this approach was never\ndreamt of by the City itself. See Brief for Respondents 18\n(setting out City’s “three basic [transition] options,” none\nof which involved the Court’s gradual refund scheme).\n   The Court suggests that the City’s administrative con-\nvenience argument is one with which the law is comfort-\nable. The Court compares the City’s decision to forgive\nthe installment balances to the sort of parking ticket and\nmortgage payment amnesty programs that currently\nabound. Ante, at 9. This analogy is misplaced: Amnesty\nprograms are designed to entice those who are unlikely\never to pay their debts to come forward and pay at least a\nportion of what they owe. It is not administrative conven-\nience alone that justifies such schemes. In a sense, these\nschemes help remedy payment inequities by prompting\nthose who would pay nothing to pay at least some of their\nfair share. The same cannot be said of the City’s system.\n   The Court is willing to concede that “administrative\nconsiderations could not justify . . . an unfair system” in\nwhich “a city arbitrarily allocate[s] taxes among a few\ncitizens while forgiving many others on the ground that it\nis cheaper and easier to collect taxes from a few people\nthan from many.” Ante, at 11. Cold comfort, that. If the\nquoted language does not accurately describe this case, I\nam not sure what it would reach.\n   The Court wisely does not embrace the City’s alterna-\ntive argument that the unequal tax burden is justified\nbecause “it would have been fiscally challenging to issue\nrefunds.” Brief for Respondents 35. “Fiscally challenging”\ngives euphemism a bad name. The City’s claim that it has\nalready spent petitioners’ money is hardly worth a re-\nsponse, and the City recognizes as much when it admits it\n6                 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncould provide refunds to petitioners by “arrang[ing] for\npayments from non-Barrett Law sources.” Id., at 36. One\ncannot evade returning money to its rightful owner by\nthe simple expedient of spending it. The “fiscal challenge”\njustification seems particularly inappropriate in this case,\nas the City—with an annual budget of approximately $900\nmillion—admits that the cost of refunding all of petition-\ners’ money would be approximately $300,000. Adopted\n2012 Budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis,\nMarion County (Oct. 17, 2011), p. 7; Tr. of Oral Arg. 17,\n58.\n   Equally unconvincing is the Court’s attempt to distin-\nguish Allegheny Pittsburgh. The Court claims that case\nwas different because it involved “a clear state law re-\nquirement clearly and dramatically violated.” Ante, at 14.\nNothing less is at stake here. Indiana law requires that\nthe costs of sewer projects be “apportioned equally among\nall abutting lands.” Ind. Code §36–9–39–15(b)(3). The\nCity has instead apportioned the costs of the Brisbane/\nManning project such that petitioners paid between 10 and\n30 times as much as their neighbors. Worse still, it\nhas done so in order to avoid administrative hassle and\nsave a bit of money. To paraphrase A Man for All Sea-\nsons: “It profits a city nothing to give up treating its citi-\nzens equally for the whole world . . . but for $300,000?”\nSee R. Bolt, A Man for All Seasons, act II, p. 158 (1st\nVintage Int’l ed. 1990).\n   Our precedents do not ask for much from government in\nthis area—only “rough equality in tax treatment.” Alle-\ngheny Pittsburgh, 488 U. S., at 343. The Court reminds us\nthat Allegheny Pittsburgh is a “rare case.” Ante, at 14. It\nis and should be; we give great leeway to taxing authori-\nties in this area, for good and sufficient reasons. But\nevery generation or so a case comes along when this Court\nneeds to say enough is enough, if the Equal Protection\nClause is to retain any force in this context. Allegheny\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          7\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nPittsburgh was such a case; so is this one. Indiana law\npromised neighboring homeowners that they would be\ntreated equally when it came to paying for sewer hook-\nups. The City then ended up charging some homeowners\n30 times what it charged their neighbors for the same\nhook-ups. The equal protection violation is plain. I would\naccordingly reverse the decision of the Indiana Supreme\nCourt, and respectfully dissent from the Court’s decision\nto do otherwise.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/801501/", "sha1": "83dfda337f1894839b8d40aef5e3344cf2b6daf3", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-06-04T07:42:57"}
