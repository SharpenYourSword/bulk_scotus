UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 11–182.      Argued April 25, 2012—Decided June 25, 2012\nAn Arizona statute known as S. B. 1070 was enacted in 2010 to address\n pressing issues related to the large number of unlawful aliens in the\n State. The United States sought to enjoin the law as preempted. The\n District Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing four of its\n provisions from taking effect. Section 3 makes failure to comply with\n federal alien-registration requirements a state misdemeanor; §5(C)\n makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien to seek or engage\n in work in the State; §6 authorizes state and local officers to arrest\n without a warrant a person “the officer has probable cause to believe\n . . . has committed any public offense that makes the person remova-\n ble from the United States”; and §2(B) requires officers conducting a\n stop, detention, or arrest to make efforts, in some circumstances, to\n verify the person’s immigration status with the Federal Government.\n The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the United States had es-\n tablished a likelihood of success on its preemption claims.\nHeld:\n    1. The Federal Government’s broad, undoubted power over immi-\n gration and alien status rests, in part, on its constitutional power to\n “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and on\n its inherent sovereign power to control and conduct foreign relations,\n see Toll v. Moreno, 458 U. S. 1, 10. Federal governance is extensive\n and complex. Among other things, federal law specifies categories of\n aliens who are ineligible to be admitted to the United States, 8\n U. S. C. §1182; requires aliens to register with the Federal Govern-\n ment and to carry proof of status, §§1304(e), 1306(a); imposes sanc-\n tions on employers who hire unauthorized workers, §1324a; and spec-\n ifies which aliens may be removed and the procedures for doing so,\n see §1227. Removal is a civil matter, and one of its principal features\n2                      ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials, who must\n    decide whether to pursue removal at all. Immigration and Customs\n    Enforcement (ICE), an agency within the Department of Homeland\n    Security, is responsible for identifying, apprehending, and removing\n    illegal aliens. It also operates the Law Enforcement Support Center,\n    which provides immigration status information to federal, state, and\n    local officials around the clock. Pp. 2–7.\n       2. The Supremacy Clause gives Congress the power to preempt\n    state law. A statute may contain an express preemption provision,\n    see, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of United States of America v. Whit-\n    ing, 563 U. S. ___, ___, but state law must also give way to federal\n    law in at least two other circumstances. First, States are precluded\n    from regulating conduct in a field that Congress has determined\n    must be regulated by its exclusive governance. See Gade v. National\n    Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 115. Intent can be in-\n    ferred from a framework of regulation “so pervasive . . . that Con-\n    gress left no room for the States to supplement it” or where a “federal\n    interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to\n    preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.” Rice v. San-\n    ta Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230. Second, state laws are\n    preempted when they conflict with federal law, including when they\n    stand “as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\n    purposes and objectives of Congress.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S.\n    52, 67. Pp. 7–8.\n       3. Sections 3, 5(C), and 6 of S. B. 1070 are preempted by federal\n    law. Pp. 8–19.\n          (a) Section 3 intrudes on the field of alien registration, a field in\n    which Congress has left no room for States to regulate. In Hines, a\n    state alien-registration program was struck down on the ground that\n    Congress intended its “complete” federal registration plan to be a\n    “single integrated and all-embracing system.” 312 U. S., at 74. That\n    scheme did not allow the States to “curtail or complement” federal\n    law or “enforce additional or auxiliary regulations.” Id., at 66–67.\n    The federal registration framework remains comprehensive. Because\n    Congress has occupied the field, even complementary state regulation\n    is impermissible. Pp. 8–11.\n          (b) Section 5(C)’s criminal penalty stands as an obstacle to the\n    federal regulatory system. The Immigration Reform and Control Act\n    of 1986 (IRCA), a comprehensive framework for “combating the em-\n    ployment of illegal aliens,” Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v.\n    NLRB, 535 U. S. 137, 147, makes it illegal for employers to knowing-\n    ly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ unauthorized workers, 8\n    U. S. C. §§1324a(a)(1)(A), (a)(2), and requires employers to verify pro-\n    spective       employees’      employment        authorization      status,\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n§§1324a(a)(1)(B), (b). It imposes criminal and civil penalties on em-\nployers, §§1324a(e)(4), (f), but only civil penalties on aliens who seek,\nor engage in, unauthorized employment, e.g., §§1255(c)(2), (c)(8).\nIRCA’s express preemption provision, though silent about whether\nadditional penalties may be imposed against employees, “does not bar\nthe ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles” or impose a\n“special burden” making it more difficult to establish the preemption\nof laws falling outside the clause. Geier v. American Honda Motor\nCo., 529 U. S. 861, 869–872. The correct instruction to draw from the\ntext, structure, and history of IRCA is that Congress decided it would\nbe inappropriate to impose criminal penalties on unauthorized em-\nployees. It follows that a state law to the contrary is an obstacle to\nthe regulatory system Congress chose. Pp. 12–15.\n      (c) By authorizing state and local officers to make warrantless\narrests of certain aliens suspected of being removable, §6 too creates\nan obstacle to federal law. As a general rule, it is not a crime for a\nremovable alien to remain in the United States. The federal scheme\ninstructs when it is appropriate to arrest an alien during the removal\nprocess. The Attorney General in some circumstances will issue a\nwarrant for trained federal immigration officers to execute. If no fed-\neral warrant has been issued, these officers have more limited au-\nthority. They may arrest an alien for being “in the United States in\nviolation of any [immigration] law or regulation,” for example, but on-\nly where the alien “is likely to escape before a warrant can be ob-\ntained.” §1357(a)(2). Section 6 attempts to provide state officers with\neven greater arrest authority, which they could exercise with no in-\nstruction from the Federal Government. This is not the system Con-\ngress created. Federal law specifies limited circumstances in which\nstate officers may perform an immigration officer’s functions. This\nincludes instances where the Attorney General has granted that au-\nthority in a formal agreement with a state or local government. See,\ne.g., §1357(g)(1). Although federal law permits state officers to “coop-\nerate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension,\ndetention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United\nStates,” §1357(g)(10)(B), this does not encompass the unilateral deci-\nsion to detain authorized by §6. Pp. 15–19.\n   4. It was improper to enjoin §2(B) before the state courts had an\nopportunity to construe it and without some showing that §2(B)’s en-\nforcement in fact conflicts with federal immigration law and its objec-\ntives. Pp. 19–24.\n      (a) The state provision has three limitations: A detainee is pre-\nsumed not to be an illegal alien if he or she provides a valid Arizona\ndriver’s license or similar identification; officers may not consider\nrace, color, or national origin “except to the extent permitted by the\n4                      ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    United States [and] Arizona Constitution[s]”; and §2(B) must be “im-\n    plemented in a manner consistent with federal law regulating immi-\n    gration, protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting the\n    privileges and immunities of United States citizens.” P. 20.\n         (b) This Court finds unpersuasive the argument that, even with\n    those limits, §2(B) must be held preempted at this stage. Pp. 20–24.\n           (1) The mandatory nature of the status checks does not inter-\n    fere with the federal immigration scheme. Consultation between fed-\n    eral and state officials is an important feature of the immigration\n    system. In fact, Congress has encouraged the sharing of information\n    about possible immigration violations. See §§1357(g)(10)(A), 1373(c).\n    The federal scheme thus leaves room for a policy requiring state offi-\n    cials to contact ICE as a routine matter. Cf. Whiting, 563 U. S., at\n    ___. Pp. 20–21.\n           (2) It is not clear at this stage and on this record that §2(B), in\n    practice, will require state officers to delay the release of detainees\n    for no reason other than to verify their immigration status. This\n    would raise constitutional concerns. And it would disrupt the federal\n    framework to put state officers in the position of holding aliens in\n    custody for possible unlawful presence without federal direction and\n    supervision. But §2(B) could be read to avoid these concerns. If the\n    law only requires state officers to conduct a status check during the\n    course of an authorized, lawful detention or after a detainee has been\n    released, the provision would likely survive preemption—at least ab-\n    sent some showing that it has other consequences that are adverse to\n    federal law and its objectives. Without the benefit of a definitive in-\n    terpretation from the state courts, it would be inappropriate to as-\n    sume §2(B) will be construed in a way that conflicts with federal law.\n    Cf. Fox v. Washington, 236 U. S. 273, 277. This opinion does not\n    foreclose other preemption and constitutional challenges to the law\n    as interpreted and applied after it goes into effect.

The law is often referred to as\nS. B. 1070, the version introduced in the state senate. See\nalso H. 2162 (2010) (amending S. 1070). Its stated pur­\npose is to “discourage and deter the unlawful entry and\npresence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlaw­\nfully present in the United States.” Note following Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051 (West 2012). The law’s provi­\nsions establish an official state policy of “attrition through\nenforcement.” Ibid. The question before the Court is\nwhether federal law preempts and renders invalid four\nseparate provisions of the state law.\n                             I\n  The United States filed this suit against Arizona, seek­\ning to enjoin S. B. 1070 as preempted. Four provisions of\nthe law are at issue here. Two create new state offenses.\nSection 3 makes failure to comply with federal alien­\nregistration requirements a state misdemeanor. Ariz.\n2                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. §13–1509 (West Supp. 2011). Section 5, in\nrelevant part, makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthor­\nized alien to seek or engage in work in the State; this\nprovision is referred to as §5(C). See §13–2928(C). Two\nother provisions give specific arrest authority and inves-\ntigative duties with respect to certain aliens to state and\nlocal law enforcement officers. Section 6 authorizes offic­\ners to arrest without a warrant a person “the officer has\nprobable cause to believe . . . has committed any public\noffense that makes the person removable from the United\nStates.” §13–3883(A)(5). Section 2(B) provides that offic­\ners who conduct a stop, detention, or arrest must in some\ncircumstances make efforts to verify the person’s immi­\ngration status with the Federal Government. See §11–\n1051(B) (West 2012).\n   The United States District Court for the District of\nArizona issued a preliminary injunction preventing the\nfour provisions at issue from taking effect. 703 F. Supp.\n2d 980, 1008 (2010). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed. 641 F. 3d 339, 366 (2011). It agreed that\nthe United States had established a likelihood of success\non its preemption claims. The Court of Appeals was unan­\nimous in its conclusion that §§3 and 5(C) were likely\npreempted. Judge Bea dissented from the decision to\nuphold the preliminary injunction against §§2(B) and 6.\nThis Court granted certiorari to resolve important ques­\ntions concerning the interaction of state and federal power\nwith respect to the law of immigration and alien status.\n565 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n\n                                \n\n                              A\n\n  The Government of the United States has broad, un­\ndoubted power over the subject of immigration and the\nstatus of aliens.

This\nauthority rests, in part, on the National Government’s\nconstitutional power to “establish an uniform Rule of Nat-\nuralization,” U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and its inher-\nent power as sovereign to control and conduct relations\nwith foreign nations, see Toll, supra, at 10 (citing United\nStates v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 318\n(1936)).\n   The federal power to determine immigration policy is\nwell settled. Immigration policy can affect trade, invest­\nment, tourism, and diplomatic relations for the entire\nNation, as well as the perceptions and expectations of\naliens in this country who seek the full protection of its\nlaws. See, e.g., Brief for Argentina et al. as Amici Curiae;\nsee also Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U. S. 580,\n588–589 (1952). Perceived mistreatment of aliens in the\nUnited States may lead to harmful reciprocal treatment\nof American citizens abroad. See Brief for Madeleine K.\nAlbright et al. as Amici Curiae 24–30.\n   It is fundamental that foreign countries concerned about\nthe status, safety, and security of their nationals in the\nUnited States must be able to confer and communicate on\nthis subject with one national sovereign, not the 50 sepa­\nrate States. See Chy Lung v. Freeman, 92 U. S. 275, 279–\n280 (1876); see also The Federalist No. 3, p. 39 (C. Rossiter\ned. 2003) (J. Jay) (observing that federal power would be\nnecessary in part because “bordering States . . . under the\nimpulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense of appar­\nent interest or injury” might take action that would un­\ndermine foreign relations). This Court has reaffirmed that\n“[o]ne of the most important and delicate of all interna­\ntional relationships . . . has to do with the protection of the\njust rights of a country’s own nationals when those na­\ntionals are in another country.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312\nU. S. 52, 64 (1941).\n   Federal governance of immigration and alien status is\n4                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nextensive and complex. Congress has specified catego­\nries of aliens who may not be admitted to the United\nStates. See 8 U. S. C. §1182. Unlawful entry and unlawful\nreentry into the country are federal offenses. §§1325,\n1326. Once here, aliens are required to register with the\nFederal Government and to carry proof of status on their\nperson. See §§1301–1306. Failure to do so is a federal\nmisdemeanor. §§1304(e), 1306(a). Federal law also au­\nthorizes States to deny noncitizens a range of public bene­\nfits, §1622; and it imposes sanctions on employers who\nhire unauthorized workers, §1324a.\n   Congress has specified which aliens may be removed\nfrom the United States and the procedures for doing so.\nAliens may be removed if they were inadmissible at the\ntime of entry, have been convicted of certain crimes, or\nmeet other criteria set by federal law. See §1227. Re­\nmoval is a civil, not criminal, matter. A principal feature of\nthe removal system is the broad discretion exercised by\nimmigration officials. See Brief for Former Commission­\ners of the United States Immigration and Naturalization\nService as Amici Curiae 8–13 (hereinafter Brief for For­\nmer INS Commissioners). Federal officials, as an initial\nmatter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue\nremoval at all. If removal proceedings commence, aliens\nmay seek asylum and other discretionary relief allowing\nthem to remain in the country or at least to leave without\nformal removal. See §1229a(c)(4); see also, e.g., §§1158\n(asylum), 1229b (cancellation of removal), 1229c (volun­\ntary departure).\n   Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law em­\nbraces immediate human concerns. Unauthorized work­\ners trying to support their families, for example, likely\npose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who com­\nmit a serious crime. The equities of an individual case\nmay turn on many factors, including whether the alien\nhas children born in the United States, long ties to the\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

Returning\nan alien to his own country may be deemed inappropriate\neven where he has committed a removable offense or fails\nto meet the criteria for admission. The foreign state may\nbe mired in civil war, complicit in political persecution, or\nenduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien\nor his family will be harmed upon return. The dynamic\nnature of relations with other countries requires the Exec­\nutive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are con­\nsistent with this Nation’s foreign policy with respect to\nthese and other realities.\n   Agencies in the Department of Homeland Security play\na major role in enforcing the country’s immigration laws.\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is re-\nsponsible for determining the admissibility of aliens and\nsecuring the country’s borders. See Dept. of Homeland\nSecurity, Office of Immigration Statistics, Immigration\nEnforcement Actions: 2010, p. 1 (2011). In 2010, CBP’s\nBorder Patrol apprehended almost half a million people.\nId., at 3. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a\nsecond agency, “conducts criminal investigations involving\nthe enforcement of immigration-related statutes.” Id., at\n2. ICE also operates the Law Enforcement Support Cen­\nter. LESC, as the Center is known, provides immigra-\ntion status information to federal, state, and local officials\naround the clock. See App. 91. ICE officers are respon­\nsible “for the identification, apprehension, and removal of\nillegal aliens from the United States.” Immigration En­\nforcement Actions, supra, at 2. Hundreds of thousands of\naliens are removed by the Federal Government every year.\nSee id., at 4 (reporting there were 387,242 removals, and\n476,405 returns without a removal order, in 2010).\n6               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n  The pervasiveness of federal regulation does not di­\nminish the importance of immigration policy to the States.\nArizona bears many of the consequences of unlawful im­\nmigration. Hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens\nare apprehended in Arizona each year. Dept. of Homeland\nSecurity, Office of Immigration Statistics, 2010 Yearbook\nof Immigration Statistics 93 (2011) (Table 35). Unauthor­\nized aliens who remain in the State comprise, by one es-\ntimate, almost six percent of the population. See Passel\n& Cohn, Pew Hispanic Center, U. S. Unauthorized Im-\nmigration Flows Are Down Sharply Since Mid-Decade 3\n(2010). And in the State’s most populous county, these\naliens are reported to be responsible for a disproportionate\nshare of serious crime. See, e.g., Camarota & Vaughan,\nCenter for Immigration Studies, Immigration and Crime:\nAssessing a Conflicted Situation 16 (2009) (Table 3) (esti­\nmating that unauthorized aliens comprise 8.9% of the\npopulation and are responsible for 21.8% of the felonies in\nMaricopa County, which includes Phoenix).\n  Statistics alone do not capture the full extent of Arizo­\nna’s concerns. Accounts in the record suggest there is an\n“epidemic of crime, safety risks, serious property damage,\nand environmental problems” associated with the influx\nof illegal migration across private land near the Mexican\nborder.

The problems\nposed to the State by illegal immigration must not be\nunderestimated.\n  These concerns are the background for the formal legal\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nanalysis that follows. The issue is whether, under pre­\nemption principles, federal law permits Arizona to imple­\nment the state-law provisions in dispute.\n                             III\n  Federalism, central to the constitutional design, adopts\nthe principle that both the National and State Govern­\nments have elements of sovereignty the other is bound to\nrespect. See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457\n(1991); U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779,\n838 (1995) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). From the existence\nof two sovereigns follows the possibility that laws can be\nin conflict or at cross-purposes. The Supremacy Clause\nprovides a clear rule that federal law “shall be the su­\npreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State\nshall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or\nLaws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”\nArt. VI, cl. 2. Under this principle, Congress has the\npower to preempt state law. See Crosby v. National For-\neign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372 (2000); Gibbons\nv. Ogden, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/scotus/roC/gibbons-appellant-v-ogden-respondent/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 210–211 (1824). There is no doubt\nthat Congress may withdraw specified powers from the\nStates by enacting a statute containing an express\npreemption provision. See, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of\nUnited States of America v. Whiting, 563 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 4).\n  State law must also give way to federal law in at least\ntwo other circumstances. First, the States are precluded\nfrom regulating conduct in a field that Congress, acting\nwithin its proper authority, has determined must be regu­\nlated by its exclusive governance. See Gade v. National\nSolid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 115 (1992).\nThe intent to displace state law altogether can be inferred\nfrom a framework of regulation “so pervasive . . . that\nCongress left no room for the States to supplement it” or\nwhere there is a “federal interest . . . so dominant that the\n8                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of\nstate laws on the same subject.” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator\nCorp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947); see English v. General\nElec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 79 (1990).\n   Second, state laws are preempted when they conflict\nwith federal law. Crosby, supra, at 372. This includes\ncases where “compliance with both federal and state\nregulations is a physical impossibility,” Florida Lime &\nAvocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142–143\n(1963), and those instances where the challenged state law\n“stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu­\ntion of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,”\nHines, 312 U. S., at 67; see also Crosby, supra, at 373\n(“What is a sufficient obstacle is a matter of judgment, to\nbe informed by examining the federal statute as a whole\nand identifying its purpose and intended effects”). In\npreemption analysis, courts should assume that “the\nhistoric police powers of the States” are not superseded\n“unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Con­\ngress.” Rice, supra, at 230; see Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.\n555, 565 (2009).\n   The four challenged provisions of the state law each\nmust be examined under these preemption principles.\n                              IV\n                               A\n                         Section 3\n   Section 3 of S. B. 1070 creates a new state misde-\nmeanor. It forbids the “willful failure to complete or carry an\nalien registration document . . . in violation of 8 United\nStates Code section 1304(e) or 1306(a).” Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §11–1509(A) (West Supp. 2011). In effect, §3 adds a\nstate-law penalty for conduct proscribed by federal law.\nThe United States contends that this state enforcement\nmechanism intrudes on the field of alien registration, a\nfield in which Congress has left no room for States to\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nregulate. See Brief for United States 27, 31.\n   The Court discussed federal alien-registration require­\nments in Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52. In 1940, as\ninternational conflict spread, Congress added to federal\nimmigration law a “complete system for alien registra­\ntion.” Id., at 70. The new federal law struck a careful\nbalance. It punished an alien’s willful failure to register\nbut did not require aliens to carry identification cards.\nThere were also limits on the sharing of registration rec­\nords and fingerprints. The Court found that Congress\nintended the federal plan for registration to be a “single\nintegrated and all-embracing system.” Id., at 74. Because\nthis “complete scheme . . . for the registration of aliens”\ntouched on foreign relations, it did not allow the States to\n“curtail or complement” federal law or to “enforce addi­\ntional or auxiliary regulations.” Id., at 66–67. As a con­\nsequence, the Court ruled that Pennsylvania could not\nenforce its own alien-registration program. See id., at 59, 74.\n   The present regime of federal regulation is not identi­\ncal to the statutory framework considered in Hines, but\nit remains comprehensive. Federal law now includes a\nrequirement that aliens carry proof of registration. 8\nU. S. C. §1304(e). Other aspects, however, have stayed the\nsame. Aliens who remain in the country for more than 30\ndays must apply for registration and be fingerprinted.\nCompare §1302(a) with id., §452(a) (1940 ed.). Detailed\ninformation is required, and any change of address has\nto be reported to the Federal Government. Compare\n§§1304(a), 1305(a) (2006 ed.), with id., §§455(a), 456 (1940\ned.). The statute continues to provide penalties for the\nwillful failure to register. Compare §1306(a) (2006 ed.),\nwith id., §457 (1940 ed.).\n   The framework enacted by Congress leads to the conclu­\nsion here, as it did in Hines, that the Federal Government\nhas occupied the field of alien registration. See American\nIns. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 419, n. 11 (2003)\n10               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(characterizing Hines as a field preemption case); Pennsyl-\nvania v. Nelson, 350 U. S. 497, 504 (1956) (same); see also\nDinh, Reassessing the Law of Preemption, 88 Geo. L. J.\n2085, 2098–2099, 2107 (2000) (same). The federal statu­\ntory directives provide a full set of standards governing\nalien registration, including the punishment for noncom­\npliance. It was designed as a “ ‘harmonious whole.’ ”\nHines, supra, at 72. Where Congress occupies an entire\nfield, as it has in the field of alien registration, even com­\nplementary state regulation is impermissible. Field pre­\nemption reflects a congressional decision to foreclose any\nstate regulation in the area, even if it is parallel to fed-\neral standards. See Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464\nU. S. 238, 249 (1984).\n   Federal law makes a single sovereign responsible for\nmaintaining a comprehensive and unified system to keep\ntrack of aliens within the Nation’s borders. If §3 of the\nArizona statute were valid, every State could give itself\nindependent authority to prosecute federal registration\nviolations, “diminish[ing] the [Federal Government]’s control\nover enforcement” and “detract[ing] from the ‘integrated\nscheme of regulation’ created by Congress.” Wisconsin\nDept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 288–289\n(1986). Even if a State may make violation of federal\nlaw a crime in some instances, it cannot do so in a field\n(like the field of alien registration) that has been occupied\nby federal law. See California v. Zook, 336 U. S. 725, 730–\n731, 733 (1949); see also In re Loney, 134 U. S. 372, 375–\n376 (1890) (States may not impose their own punishment\nfor perjury in federal courts).\n   Arizona contends that §3 can survive preemption be­\ncause the provision has the same aim as federal law and\nadopts its substantive standards. This argument not only\nignores the basic premise of field preemption—that States\nmay not enter, in any respect, an area the Federal Gov­\nernment has reserved for itself—but also is unpersuasive\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non its own terms. Permitting the State to impose its own\npenalties for the federal offenses here would conflict with\nthe careful framework Congress adopted. Cf. Buckman\nCo. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341, 347–348\n(2001) (States may not impose their own punishment for\nfraud on the Food and Drug Administration); Wisconsin\nDept., supra, at 288 (States may not impose their own\npunishment for repeat violations of the National Labor\nRelations Act). Were §3 to come into force, the State\nwould have the power to bring criminal charges against\nindividuals for violating a federal law even in circum­\nstances where federal officials in charge of the comprehen­\nsive scheme determine that prosecution would frustrate\nfederal policies.\n   There is a further intrusion upon the federal scheme.\nEven where federal authorities believe prosecution is ap-\npropriate, there is an inconsistency between §3 and fed-\neral law with respect to penalties. Under federal law,\nthe failure to carry registration papers is a misdemeanor\nthat may be punished by a fine, imprisonment, or a term\nof probation. See 8 U. S. C. §1304(e) (2006 ed.); 18 U. S. C.\n§3561. State law, by contrast, rules out probation as a\npossible sentence (and also eliminates the possibility of\na pardon). See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–1509(D) (West\nSupp. 2011). This state framework of sanctions creates a\nconflict with the plan Congress put in place. See Wiscon-\nsin Dept., supra, at 286 (“[C]onflict is imminent whenever\ntwo separate remedies are brought to bear on the same\nactivity” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   These specific conflicts between state and federal law\nsimply underscore the reason for field preemption. As it\ndid in Hines, the Court now concludes that, with respect\nto the subject of alien registration, Congress intended to\npreclude States from “complement[ing] the federal law, or\nenforc[ing] additional or auxiliary regulations.” 312 U. S.,\nat 66–67. Section 3 is preempted by federal law.\n12              ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                                B\n                         Section 5(C)\n   Unlike §3, which replicates federal statutory require­\nments, §5(C) enacts a state criminal prohibition where no\nfederal counterpart exists. The provision makes it a state\nmisdemeanor for “an unauthorized alien to knowingly ap-\nply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform\nwork as an employee or independent contractor” in Ari­\nzona. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–2928(C) (West Supp. 2011).\nViolations can be punished by a $2,500 fine and incarcera­\ntion for up to six months. See §13–2928(F); see also\n§§13–707(A)(1) (West 2010); 13–802(A); 13–902(A)(5). The\nUnited States contends that the provision upsets the bal-\nance struck by the Immigration Reform and Control Act\nof 1986 (IRCA) and must be preempted as an obstacle\nto the federal plan of regulation and control.\n   When there was no comprehensive federal program\nregulating the employment of unauthorized aliens, this\nCourt found that a State had authority to pass its own\nlaws on the subject. In 1971, for example, California\npassed a law imposing civil penalties on the employment\nof aliens who were “not entitled to lawful residence in the\nUnited States if such employment would have an adverse\neffect on lawful resident workers.” 1971 Cal. Stats. ch.\n1442, §1(a). The law was upheld against a preemption\nchallenge in De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351 (1976). De\nCanas recognized that “States possess broad authority\nunder their police powers to regulate the employment\nrelationship to protect workers within the State.” Id., at\n356. At that point, however, the Federal Government had\nexpressed no more than “a peripheral concern with [the]\nemployment of illegal entrants.” Id., at 360; see Whiting,\n563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).\n   Current federal law is substantially different from the\nregime that prevailed when De Canas was decided. Con­\ngress enacted IRCA as a comprehensive framework for\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“combating the employment of illegal aliens.” Hoffman\nPlastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U. S. 137, 147\n(2002). The law makes it illegal for employers to know­\ningly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ unauthorized\nworkers. See 8 U. S. C. §§1324a(a)(1)(A), (a)(2). It also\nrequires every employer to verify the employment authori­\nzation status of prospective employees. See §§1324a(a)\n(1)(B), (b); 8 CFR §274a.2(b) (2012). These requirements\nare enforced through criminal penalties and an escalat­\ning series of civil penalties tied to the number of times\nan employer has violated the provisions. See 8 U. S. C.\n§§1324a(e)(4), (f); 8 CFR §274a.10.\n  This comprehensive framework does not impose federal\ncriminal sanctions on the employee side (i.e., penalties on\naliens who seek or engage in unauthorized work). Under\nfederal law some civil penalties are imposed instead. With\ncertain exceptions, aliens who accept unlawful employ­\nment are not eligible to have their status adjusted to\nthat of a lawful permanent resident. See 8 U. S. C.\n§§1255(c)(2), (c)(8). Aliens also may be removed from the\ncountry for having engaged in unauthorized work. See\n§1227(a)(1)(C)(i); 8 CFR §214.1(e). In addition to specify­\ning these civil consequences, federal law makes it a crime\nfor unauthorized workers to obtain employment through\nfraudulent means. See 18 U. S. C. §1546(b). Congress has\nmade clear, however, that any information employees\nsubmit to indicate their work status “may not be used” for\npurposes other than prosecution under specified federal\ncriminal statutes for fraud, perjury, and related conduct.\nSee 8 U. S. C. §§1324a(b)(5), (d)(2)(F)–(G).\n  The legislative background of IRCA underscores the fact\nthat Congress made a deliberate choice not to impose crim­\n\ninal penalties on aliens who seek, or engage in, unauthor­\nized employment. A commission established by Congress\nto study immigration policy and to make recommen­\ndations concluded these penalties would be “unnecessary\n14              ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand unworkable.” U. S. Immigration Policy and the Na­\ntional Interest: The Final Report and Recommendations of\nthe Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy\nwith Supplemental Views by Commissioners 65–66 (1981);\nsee Pub. L. 95–412, §4, 92 Stat. 907. Proposals to make\nunauthorized work a criminal offense were debated and\ndiscussed during the long process of drafting IRCA. See\nBrief for Service Employees International Union et al. as\nAmici Curiae 9–12. But Congress rejected them. See, e.g.,\n119 Cong. Rec. 14184 (1973) (statement of Rep. Dennis).\nIn the end, IRCA’s framework reflects a considered judg­\nment that making criminals out of aliens engaged in\nunauthorized work—aliens who already face the possibil­\nity of employer exploitation because of their removable\nstatus—would be inconsistent with federal policy and ob-\njectives. See, e.g., Hearings before the Subcommittee\nNo. 1 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 92d Cong.,\n1st Sess., pt. 3, pp. 919–920 (1971) (statement of Rep.\nRodino, the eventual sponsor of IRCA in the House of\nRepresentatives).\n   IRCA’s express preemption provision, which in most\ninstances bars States from imposing penalties on employ­\ners of unauthorized aliens, is silent about whether addi­\ntional penalties may be imposed against the employees\nthemselves. See 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2); Whiting, supra,\nat ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2). But the existence of an “ex­\npress pre-emption provisio[n] does not bar the ordinary\nworking of conflict pre-emption principles” or impose a\n“special burden” that would make it more difficult to\nestablish the preemption of laws falling outside the clause.\nGeier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 869–\n872 (2000); see Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51,\n65 (2002).\n   The ordinary principles of preemption include the well­\nsettled proposition that a state law is preempted where it\n“stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and exe­\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.”\nHines, 312 U. S., at 67. Under §5(C) of S. B. 1070, Arizona\nlaw would interfere with the careful balance struck by\nCongress with respect to unauthorized employment of\naliens. Although §5(C) attempts to achieve one of the\nsame goals as federal law—the deterrence of unlawful\nemployment—it involves a conflict in the method of en­\nforcement. The Court has recognized that a “[c]onflict\nin technique can be fully as disruptive to the system Con­\ngress enacted as conflict in overt policy.” Motor Coach\nEmployees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 287 (1971). The\ncorrect instruction to draw from the text, structure, and\nhistory of IRCA is that Congress decided it would be inap­\npropriate to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek\nor engage in unauthorized employment. It follows that a\nstate law to the contrary is an obstacle to the regulatory\nsystem Congress chose. See Puerto Rico Dept. of Con-\nsumer Affairs v. ISLA Petroleum Corp., 485 U. S. 495, 503\n(1988) (“Where a comprehensive federal scheme intention­\nally leaves a portion of the regulated field without con­\ntrols, then the pre-emptive inference can be drawn—not\nfrom federal inaction alone, but from inaction joined with\naction”). Section 5(C) is preempted by federal law.\n                              C\n                          Section 6\n  Section 6 of S. B. 1070 provides that a state officer,\n“without a warrant, may arrest a person if the officer has\nprobable cause to believe . . . [the person] has committed\nany public offense that makes [him] removable from the\nUnited States.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–3883(A)(5)\n(West Supp. 2011). The United States argues that arrests\nauthorized by this statute would be an obstacle to the\nremoval system Congress created.\n  As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien\nto remain present in the United States. See INS v. Lopez-\n16               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMendoza, 468 U. S. 1032, 1038 (1984). If the police stop\nsomeone based on nothing more than possible removabil­\nity, the usual predicate for an arrest is absent. When an\nalien is suspected of being removable, a federal official\nissues an administrative document called a Notice to Ap­\npear. See 8 U. S. C. §1229(a); 8 CFR §239.1(a) (2012).\nThe form does not authorize an arrest. Instead, it gives\nthe alien information about the proceedings, including the\ntime and date of the removal hearing. See 8 U. S. C.\n§1229(a)(1). If an alien fails to appear, an in absentia\norder may direct removal. §1229a(5)(A).\n   The federal statutory structure instructs when it is ap­\npropriate to arrest an alien during the removal process.\nFor example, the Attorney General can exercise discretion\nto issue a warrant for an alien’s arrest and detention\n“pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed\nfrom the United States.” 8 U. S. C. §1226(a); see Memo­\nrandum from John Morton, Director, ICE, to All Field\nOffice Directors et al., Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion\nConsistent with the Civil Immigration Enforcement Prior­\nities of the Agency for the Apprehension, Detention, and\nRemoval of Aliens (June 17, 2011) (hereinafter 2011 ICE\nMemorandum) (describing factors informing this and re­\nlated decisions). And if an alien is ordered removed after\na hearing, the Attorney General will issue a warrant.\nSee 8 CFR §241.2(a)(1). In both instances, the warrants\nare executed by federal officers who have received training\nin the enforcement of immigration law. See §§241.2(b),\n287.5(e)(3). If no federal warrant has been issued, those\nofficers have more limited authority. See 8 U. S. C. §1357(a).\nThey may arrest an alien for being “in the United\nStates in violation of any [immigration] law or regula-\ntion,” for example, but only where the alien “is likely to\nescape before a warrant can be obtained.” §1357(a)(2).\n   Section 6 attempts to provide state officers even greater\nauthority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible remova­\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbility than Congress has given to trained federal immi-\ngration officers. Under state law, officers who believe\nan alien is removable by reason of some “public offense”\nwould have the power to conduct an arrest on that basis\nregardless of whether a federal warrant has issued or\nthe alien is likely to escape. This state authority could be\nexercised without any input from the Federal Government\nabout whether an arrest is warranted in a particular case.\nThis would allow the State to achieve its own immigra­\ntion policy. The result could be unnecessary harassment\nof some aliens (for instance, a veteran, college student, or\nsomeone assisting with a criminal investigation) whom\nfederal officials determine should not be removed.\n   This is not the system Congress created. Federal law\nspecifies limited circumstances in which state officers may\nperform the functions of an immigration officer. A princi­\npal example is when the Attorney General has granted\nthat authority to specific officers in a formal agreement\nwith a state or local government. See §1357(g)(1); see also\n§1103(a)(10) (authority may be extended in the event of an\n“imminent mass influx of aliens off the coast of the United\nStates”); §1252c (authority to arrest in specific circum­\nstance after consultation with the Federal Government);\n§1324(c) (authority to arrest for bringing in and harboring\ncertain aliens). Officers covered by these agreements are\nsubject to the Attorney General’s direction and super­\nvision. §1357(g)(3). There are significant complexities\ninvolved in enforcing federal immigration law, including\nthe determination whether a person is removable. See\nPadilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2010) (ALITO,\nJ., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 4–7). As a result,\nthe agreements reached with the Attorney General must\ncontain written certification that officers have received\nadequate training to carry out the duties of an immigra­\ntion officer. See §1357(g)(2); cf. 8 CFR §§287.5(c) (ar-\nrest power contingent on training), 287.1(g) (defining the\n18               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntraining).\n    By authorizing state officers to decide whether an\nalien should be detained for being removable, §6 violates\nthe principle that the removal process is entrusted to the\ndiscretion of the Federal Government. See, e.g., Reno v.\nAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471,\n483–484 (1999); see also Brief for Former INS Commis­\nsioners 8–13. A decision on removability requires a de­\ntermination whether it is appropriate to allow a foreign\nnational to continue living in the United States. Decisions\nof this nature touch on foreign relations and must be made\nwith one voice. See Jama v. Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 348 (2005) (“Removal deci­\nsions, including the selection of a removed alien’s destina­\ntion, may implicate [the Nation’s] relations with foreign\npowers and require consideration of changing political and\neconomic circumstances” (internal quotation marks omit­\nted)); see also Galvan v. Press, 347 U. S. 522, 531 (1954)\n(“Policies pertaining to the entry of aliens and their right\nto remain here are . . . entrusted exclusively to Congress\n. . .”); Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33, 42 (1915) (“The author­\nity to control immigration—to admit or exclude aliens—is\nvested solely in the Federal Government”).\n    In defense of §6, Arizona notes a federal statute permit­\nting state officers to “cooperate with the Attorney General\nin the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal\nof aliens not lawfully present in the United States.” 8\nU. S. C. §1357(g)(10)(B). There may be some ambiguity as\nto what constitutes cooperation under the federal law; but\nno coherent understanding of the term would incorporate\nthe unilateral decision of state officers to arrest an alien\nfor being removable absent any request, approval, or other\ninstruction from the Federal Government. The Depart­\nment of Homeland Security gives examples of what would\nconstitute cooperation under federal law. These include\nsituations where States participate in a joint task force\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

State officials can also assist\nthe Federal Government by responding to requests for\ninformation about when an alien will be released from\ntheir custody. See §1357(d). But the unilateral state\naction to detain authorized by §6 goes far beyond these\nmeasures, defeating any need for real cooperation.\n   Congress has put in place a system in which state offic­\ners may not make warrantless arrests of aliens based on\npossible removability except in specific, limited circum­\nstances. By nonetheless authorizing state and local offi-\ncers to engage in these enforcement activities as a general\nmatter, §6 creates an obstacle to the full purposes and\nobjectives of Congress. See Hines, 312 U. S., at 67. Sec­\ntion 6 is preempted by federal law.\n                             D\n                        Section 2(B)\n  Section 2(B) of S. B. 1070 requires state officers to make\na “reasonable attempt . . . to determine the immigration\nstatus” of any person they stop, detain, or arrest on some\nother legitimate basis if “reasonable suspicion exists that\nthe person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the\nUnited States.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(B) (West\n2012). The law also provides that “[a]ny person who is\narrested shall have the person’s immigration status de­\ntermined before the person is released.” Ibid. The accepted\nway to perform these status checks is to contact ICE,\nwhich maintains a database of immigration records.\n20               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Three limits are built into the state provision. First, a\ndetainee is presumed not to be an alien unlawfully present\nin the United States if he or she provides a valid Arizona\ndriver’s license or similar identification. Second, officers\n“may not consider race, color or national origin . . . except\nto the extent permitted by the United States [and] Ari­\nzona Constitution[s].” Ibid. Third, the provisions must\nbe “implemented in a manner consistent with federal law\nregulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all\npersons and respecting the privileges and immunities of\nUnited States citizens.” §11–1051(L) (West 2012).\n  The United States and its amici contend that, even with\nthese limits, the State’s verification requirements pose an\nobstacle to the framework Congress put in place. The first\nconcern is the mandatory nature of the status checks. The\nsecond is the possibility of prolonged detention while the\nchecks are being performed.\n                               1\n  Consultation between federal and state officials is an\nimportant feature of the immigration system. Congress\nhas made clear that no formal agreement or special train­\ning needs to be in place for state officers to “communicate\nwith the [Federal Government] regarding the immigration\nstatus of any individual, including reporting knowledge\nthat a particular alien is not lawfully present in the United\nStates.” 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10)(A). And Congress has\nobligated ICE to respond to any request made by state\nofficials for verification of a person’s citizenship or im-\nmigration status. See §1373(c); see also §1226(d)(1)(A)\n(requiring a system for determining whether individuals\narrested for aggravated felonies are aliens). ICE’s Law\nEnforcement Support Center operates “24 hours a day,\nseven days a week, 365 days a year” and provides, among\nother things, “immigration status, identity information\nand real-time assistance to local, state and federal law\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

LESC re­\n\nsponded to more than one million requests for information\nin 2009 alone. App. 93.\n   The United States argues that making status verifica­\ntion mandatory interferes with the federal immigration\nscheme. It is true that §2(B) does not allow state officers\nto consider federal enforcement priorities in deciding\nwhether to contact ICE about someone they have de­\ntained. See Brief for United States 47–50. In other words,\nthe officers must make an inquiry even in cases where it\nseems unlikely that the Attorney General would have\nthe alien removed. This might be the case, for example,\nwhen an alien is an elderly veteran with significant and\nlongstanding ties to the community. See 2011 ICE Memo­\nrandum 4–5 (mentioning these factors as relevant).\n   Congress has done nothing to suggest it is inappropriate\nto communicate with ICE in these situations, however.\nIndeed, it has encouraged the sharing of information about\npossible immigration violations. See 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)\n(10)(A). A federal statute regulating the public benefits\nprovided to qualified aliens in fact instructs that “no State\nor local government entity may be prohibited, or in any\nway restricted, from sending to or receiving from [ICE]\ninformation regarding the immigration status, lawful or\nunlawful, of an alien in the United States.” §1644. The\nfederal scheme thus leaves room for a policy requiring\nstate officials to contact ICE as a routine matter. Cf.\nWhiting, 563 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 23–24) (reject­\ning argument that federal law preempted Arizona’s re­\nquirement that employers determine whether employees\nwere eligible to work through the federal E-Verify system\nwhere the Federal Government had encouraged its use).\n22               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               2\n   Some who support the challenge to §2(B) argue that, in\npractice, state officers will be required to delay the release\nof some detainees for no reason other than to verify their\nimmigration status. See, e.g., Brief for Former Arizona\nAttorney General Terry Goddard et al. as Amici Curiae 37,\nn. 49. Detaining individuals solely to verify their immi­\ngration status would raise constitutional concerns. See,\ne.g., Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U. S. 323, 333 (2009); Illinois\nv. Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407 (2005) (“A seizure that is\njustified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket\nto the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond\nthe time reasonably required to complete that mission”).\nAnd it would disrupt the federal framework to put state\nofficers in the position of holding aliens in custody for\npossible unlawful presence without federal direction and\nsupervision. Cf. Part IV–C, supra (concluding that Ari­\nzona may not authorize warrantless arrests on the basis of\nremovability). The program put in place by Congress does\nnot allow state or local officers to adopt this enforcement\nmechanism.\n   But §2(B) could be read to avoid these concerns. To take\none example, a person might be stopped for jaywalking in\nTucson and be unable to produce identification. The first\nsentence of §2(B) instructs officers to make a “reasonable”\nattempt to verify his immigration status with ICE if there\nis reasonable suspicion that his presence in the United\nStates is unlawful. The state courts may conclude that,\nunless the person continues to be suspected of some crime\nfor which he may be detained by state officers, it would\nnot be reasonable to prolong the stop for the immigration\ninquiry. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 12, n. 4 (“[Section\n2(B)] does not require the verification be completed during\nthe stop or detention if that is not reasonable or practica­\nble”); cf. Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 101 (2005) (finding\nno Fourth Amendment violation where questioning about\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nimmigration status did not prolong a stop).\n   To take another example, a person might be held pend­\ning release on a charge of driving under the influence of\nalcohol. As this goes beyond a mere stop, the arrestee\n(unlike the jaywalker) would appear to be subject to the\ncategorical requirement in the second sentence of §2(B)\nthat “[a]ny person who is arrested shall have the person’s\nimmigration status determined before [he] is released.”\nState courts may read this as an instruction to initiate a\nstatus check every time someone is arrested, or in some\nsubset of those cases, rather than as a command to hold\nthe person until the check is complete no matter the cir­\ncumstances. Even if the law is read as an instruction to\ncomplete a check while the person is in custody, moreover,\nit is not clear at this stage and on this record that the\nverification process would result in prolonged detention.\n   However the law is interpreted, if §2(B) only requires\nstate officers to conduct a status check during the course\nof an authorized, lawful detention or after a detainee has\nbeen released, the provision likely would survive pre-\nemption—at least absent some showing that it has other\nconsequences that are adverse to federal law and its objec­\ntives. There is no need in this case to address whether\nreasonable suspicion of illegal entry or another immigra­\ntion crime would be a legitimate basis for prolonging a\ndetention, or whether this too would be preempted by\nfederal law. See, e.g., United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S.\n581, 589 (1948) (authority of state officers to make arrests\nfor federal crimes is, absent federal statutory instruction,\na matter of state law); Gonzales v. Peoria, 722 F. 2d 468,\n475–476 (CA9 1983) (concluding that Arizona officers have\nauthority to enforce the criminal provisions of federal\nimmigration law), overruled on other grounds in Hodgers-\nDurgin v. de la Vina, 199 F. 3d 1037 (CA9 1999).\n   The nature and timing of this case counsel caution in\nevaluating the validity of §2(B). The Federal Government\n24               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhas brought suit against a sovereign State to challenge the\nprovision even before the law has gone into effect. There\nis a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how\nit will be enforced. At this stage, without the benefit of a\ndefinitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be\ninappropriate to assume §2(B) will be construed in a way\nthat creates a conflict with federal law. Cf. Fox v. Wash-\nington, 236 U. S. 273, 277 (1915) (“So far as statutes fairly\nmay be construed in such a way as to avoid doubtful con­\nstitutional questions they should be so construed; and it is\nto be presumed that state laws will be construed in that\nway by the state courts” (citation omitted)). As a result,\nthe United States cannot prevail in its current challenge.\nSee Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S. 440,\n446 (1960) (“To hold otherwise would be to ignore the\nteaching of this Court’s decisions which enjoin seeking out\nconflicts between state and federal regulation where none\nclearly exists”). This opinion does not foreclose other\npreemption and constitutional challenges to the law as\ninterpreted and applied after it goes into effect.\n                             V\n  Immigration policy shapes the destiny of the Nation.\nOn May 24, 2012, at one of this Nation’s most distin­\nguished museums of history, a dozen immigrants stood\nbefore the tattered flag that inspired Francis Scott Key\nto write the National Anthem.

Today’s opinion, ap­\nproving virtually all of the Ninth Circuit’s injunction\nagainst enforcement of the four challenged provisions of\nArizona’s law, deprives States of what most would con-\nsider the defining characteristic of sovereignty: the power\nto exclude from the sovereign’s territory people who have\nno right to be there. Neither the Constitution itself nor\neven any law passed by Congress supports this result. I\ndissent.\n                            I\n  As a sovereign, Arizona has the inherent power to ex­\nclude persons from its territory, subject only to those\nlimitations expressed in the Constitution or constitution­\nally imposed by Congress. That power to exclude has long\nbeen recognized as inherent in sovereignty. Emer de\nVattel’s seminal 1758 treatise on the Law of Nations\nstated:\n    “The sovereign may forbid the entrance of his territory\n    either to foreigners in general, or in particular cases,\n    or to certain persons, or for certain particular pur-\n    poses, according as he may think it advantageous to\n2                   ARIZONA v.

There is nothing in all this, that does not\n      flow from the rights of domain and sovereignty: every\n      one is obliged to pay respect to the prohibition; and\n      whoever dares violate it, incurs the penalty decreed\n      to render it effectual.” The Law of Nations, bk.

IV. This meant that an unwelcome\nalien could obtain all the rights of a citizen of one State\nsimply by first becoming an inhabitant of another. To\nremedy this, the Constitution’s Privileges and Immunities\nClause provided that “[t]he Citizens of each State shall be\nentitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the\nseveral States.” Art. IV, §2, cl. 1 (emphasis added). But\nif one State had particularly lax citizenship standards, it\nmight still serve as a gateway for the entry of “obnoxious\naliens” into other States. This problem was solved “by\nauthorizing the general government to establish a uniform\nrule of naturalization throughout the United States.” The\nFederalist No. 42, supra, at 271; see Art. I, §8, cl. 4. In\nother words, the naturalization power was given to Con­\ngress not to abrogate States’ power to exclude those they\ndid not want, but to vindicate it.\n   Two other provisions of the Constitution are an ac­\nknowledgment of the States’ sovereign interest in protect­\ning their borders. Article I provides that “[n]o State shall,\nwithout the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or\nDuties on Imports or Exports, except what may be abso­\nlutely necessary for executing it’s inspection Laws.” Art. I,\n§10, cl. 2 (emphasis added). This assumed what everyone\nassumed: that the States could exclude from their territory\ndangerous or unwholesome goods. A later portion of the\nsame section provides that “[n]o State shall, without the\nConsent of Congress, . . . engage in War, unless actually\ninvaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of\ndelay.” Art. I, §10, cl. 3 (emphasis added). This limits the\nStates’ sovereignty (in a way not relevant here) but leaves\nintact their inherent power to protect their territory.\n   Notwithstanding “[t]he myth of an era of unrestricted\n4                    ARIZONA v.

State laws not only pro­\nvided for the removal of unwanted immigrants but also\nimposed penalties on unlawfully present aliens and those\nwho aided their immigration.2 Id., at 1883.\n   In fact, the controversy surrounding the Alien and\nSedition Acts involved a debate over whether, under the\nConstitution, the States had exclusive authority to enact\nsuch immigration laws. Criticism of the Sedition Act has\nbecome a prominent feature of our First Amendment\njurisprudence, see, e.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,\n376 U. S. 254, 273–276 (1964), but one of the Alien Acts3\nalso aroused controversy at the time:\n     “Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa­\n     tives of the United States of America in Congress as­\n     sembled, That it shall be lawful for the President of\n     the United States at any time during the continuance\n     of this act, to order all such aliens as he shall judge\n     dangerous to the peace and safety of the United\n     States, or shall have reasonable grounds to suspect\n     are concerned in any treasonable or secret machina­\n     tions against the government thereof, to depart out of\n     the territory of the United States . . . .” An Act con­\n     cerning Aliens, 1 Stat. 570, 570–571.\n\n——————\n  2 E.g., Va.

Jefferson’s\nKentucky Resolutions insisted “that alien friends are\nunder the jurisdiction and protection of the laws of the\nstate wherein they are [and] that no power over them has\nbeen delegated to the United States, nor prohibited to\nthe individual states, distinct from their power over citi­\nzens.” Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, reprinted in J. Powell,\nLanguages of Power: A Sourcebook of Early American\nConstitutional History 131 (1991). Madison’s Virginia\nResolutions likewise contended that the Alien Act pur­\nported to give the President “a power nowhere delegated\nto the federal government.” Virginia Resolutions of 1798,\nreprinted in Powell, supra, at 134 (emphasis omitted).\nNotably, moreover, the Federalist proponents of the Act\ndefended it primarily on the ground that “[t]he removal of\naliens is the usual preliminary of hostility” and could\ntherefore be justified in exercise of the Federal Govern­\nment’s war powers. Massachussets Resolutions in Reply\nto Virginia, reprinted in Powell, supra, at 136.\n  In Mayor of New York v.

After\ndiscussing the sovereign authority to regulate the en­\ntrance of foreigners described by De Vattel, the Court said:\n       “The power . . . of New York to pass this law having\n    undeniably existed at the formation of the constitu­\n    tion, the simply inquiry is, whether by that instru­\n    ment it was taken from the states, and granted to\n    congress; for if it were not, it yet remains with them.”\n    Id., at 132.\n6                ARIZONA v.

But with the fleeting exception of the Alien Act,\nCongress did not enact any legislation regulating immi­\ngration for the better part of a century. In 1862, Congress\npassed “An Act to prohibit the ‘Coolie Trade’ by American\nCitizens in American Vessels,” which prohibited “procur­\ning [Chinese nationals] . . . to be disposed of, or sold, or\ntransferred, for any term of years or for any time what­\never, as servants or apprentices, or to be held to service or\nlabor.” 12 Stat. 340. Then, in 1875, Congress amended\nthat act to bar admission to Chinese, Japanese, and other\nAsian immigrants who had “entered into a contract or\nagreement for a term of service within the United States,\nfor lewd and immoral purposes.” An act supplementary to\nthe acts in relation to immigration, ch. 141, 18 Stat. 477.\nAnd in 1882, Congress enacted the first general immi­\ngration statute. See An act to regulate Immigration, 22\nStat. 214. Of course, it hardly bears mention that Federal\nimmigration law is now extensive.\n   I accept that as a valid exercise of federal power—not\nbecause of the Naturalization Clause (it has no necessary\nconnection to citizenship) but because it is an inherent\nattribute of sovereignty no less for the United States than\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nfor the States. As this Court has said, it is an “ ‘accepted\nmaxim of international law, that every sovereign nation\nhas the power, as inherent in sovereignty, and essential to\nself-preservation, to forbid the entrance of foreigners\nwithin its dominions.’ ” Fong Yue Ting v. United States,\n149 U. S. 698, 705 (1893) (quoting Ekiu v. United States,\n142 U. S. 651, 659 (1892)). That is why there was no need\nto set forth control of immigration as one of the enumer­\nated powers of Congress, although an acknowledgment of\nthat power (as well as of the States’ similar power, subject\nto federal abridgment) was contained in Art. I, §9, which\nprovided that “[t]he Migration or Importation of such\nPersons as any of the States now existing shall think\nproper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress\nprior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and\neight . . . .”\n   In light of the predominance of federal immigration\nrestrictions in modern times, it is easy to lose sight of the\nStates’ traditional role in regulating immigration—and to\noverlook their sovereign prerogative to do so. I accept as a\ngiven that State regulation is excluded by the Constitution\nwhen (1) it has been prohibited by a valid federal law, or\n(2) it conflicts with federal regulation—when, for example,\nit admits those whom federal regulation would exclude, or\nexcludes those whom federal regulation would admit.\n   Possibility (1) need not be considered here: there is no\nfederal law prohibiting the States’ sovereign power to ex-\nclude (assuming federal authority to enact such a law).\nThe mere existence of federal action in the immigration\narea—and the so-called field preemption arising from that\naction, upon which the Court’s opinion so heavily relies,\nante, at 9–11—cannot be regarded as such a prohibition.\nWe are not talking here about a federal law prohibiting\nthe States from regulating bubble-gum advertising, or\neven the construction of nuclear plants. We are talking\nabout a federal law going to the core of state sovereignty:\n8                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe power to exclude. Like elimination of the States’ other\ninherent sovereign power, immunity from suit, elimina-\ntion of the States’ sovereign power to exclude requires that\n“Congress . . . unequivocally expres[s] its intent to abro­\ngate,” Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 55\n(1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nImplicit “field preemption” will not do.\n   Nor can federal power over illegal immigration be\ndeemed exclusive because of what the Court’s opinion\nsolicitously calls “foreign countries[ ’] concern[s] about the\nstatus, safety, and security of their nationals in the United\nStates,” ante, at 3. The Constitution gives all those on our\nshores the protections of the Bill of Rights—but just as\nthose rights are not expanded for foreign nationals be­\ncause of their countries’ views (some countries, for exam­\nple, have recently discovered the death penalty to be\nbarbaric), neither are the fundamental sovereign powers\nof the States abridged to accommodate foreign countries’\nviews. Even in its international relations, the Federal\nGovernment must live with the inconvenient fact that it is\na Union of independent States, who have their own sover­\neign powers. This is not the first time it has found that a\nnuisance and a bother in the conduct of foreign policy.\nFour years ago, for example, the Government importuned\nus to interfere with thoroughly constitutional state judicial\nprocedures in the criminal trial of foreign nationals be­\ncause the international community, and even an opinion of\nthe International Court of Justice, disapproved them. See\nMedellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. 491 (2008). We rejected that\nrequest, as we should reject the Executive’s invocation of\nforeign-affairs considerations here. Though it may upset\nforeign powers—and even when the Federal Government\ndesperately wants to avoid upsetting foreign powers—the\nStates have the right to protect their borders against\nforeign nationals, just as they have the right to execute\nforeign nationals for murder.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n  What this case comes down to, then, is whether the\nArizona law conflicts with federal immigration law—\nwhether it excludes those whom federal law would admit,\nor admits those whom federal law would exclude. It does\nnot purport to do so. It applies only to aliens who neither\npossess a privilege to be present under federal law nor\nhave been removed pursuant to the Federal Government’s\ninherent authority. I proceed to consider the challenged\nprovisions in detail.\n                            §2(B)\n    “For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by a\n    law enforcement official . . . in the enforcement of any\n    other law or ordinance of a county, city or town or this\n    state where reasonable suspicion exists that the per­\n    son is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United\n    States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when\n    practicable, to determine the immigration status of\n    the person, except if the determination may hinder or\n    obstruct an investigation. Any person who is arrested\n    shall have the person’s immigration status deter­\n    mined before the person is released. . . .” S. B. 1070,\n    §2(B), as amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(B)\n    (West 2012).\n  The Government has conceded that “even before Section\n2 was enacted, state and local officers had state-law au­\nthority to inquire of DHS [the Department of Homeland\nSecurity] about a suspect’s unlawful status and other-\nwise cooperate with federal immigration officers.” Brief for\nUnited States 47 (citing App. 62, 82); see also Brief for\nUnited States 48–49. That concession, in my view, ob-\nviates the need for further inquiry. The Government’s\nconflict-pre-emption claim calls on us “to determine\nwhether, under the circumstances of this particular case,\n[the State’s] law stands as an obstacle to the accomplish­\nment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of\n10               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nCongress.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)\n(emphasis added). It is impossible to make such a finding\nwithout a factual record concerning the manner in which\nArizona is implementing these provisions—something the\nGovernment’s pre-enforcement challenge has pretermitted.\n“The fact that [a law] might operate unconstitutionally\nunder some conceivable set of circumstances is insuf-\nficient to render it wholly invalid, since we have not\nrecognized an ‘overbreadth’ doctrine outside the limited\ncontext of the First Amendment.” United States v. Sal­\nerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). And on its face, §2(B)\nmerely tells state officials that they are authorized to do\nsomething that they were, by the Government’s con­\ncession, already authorized to do.\n    The Court therefore properly rejects the Government’s\nchallenge, recognizing that, “[a]t this stage, without the\nbenefit of a definitive interpretation from the state courts,\nit would be inappropriate to assume §2B will be construed\nin a way that creates a conflict with federal law.” Ante, at\n23. Before reaching that conclusion, however, the Court\ngoes to great length to assuage fears that “state officers\nwill be required to delay the release of some detainees for\nno reason other than to verify their immigration status.”\nAnte, at 22. Of course, any investigatory detention, in­\ncluding one under §2(B), may become an “unreasonable\n. . . seizur[e],” U. S. Const., Amdt. IV, if it lasts too long.\nSee Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407 (2005). But\nthat has nothing to do with this case, in which the Gov­\nernment claims that §2(B) is pre-empted by federal immi­\ngration law, not that anyone’s Fourth Amendment rights\nhave been violated. And I know of no reason why a\nprotracted detention that does not violate the Fourth\nAmendment would contradict or conflict with any federal\nimmigration law.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n                              §6\n    “A peace officer, without a warrant, may arrest a per­\n    son if the officer has probable cause to believe . . .\n    [t]he person to be arrested has committed any public\n    offense that makes the person removable from the\n    United States.” S. B. 1070, §6(A)(5), Ariz. Rev. Stat.\n    Ann. §13–3883(A)(5) (West Supp. 2011).\n  This provision of S. B. 1070 expands the statutory list of\noffenses for which an Arizona police officer may make an\narrest without a warrant. See §13–3883. If an officer has\nprobable cause to believe that an individual is “removable”\nby reason of a public offense, then a warrant is not re­\nquired to make an arrest. The Government’s primary\ncontention is that §6 is pre-empted by federal immigration\nlaw because it allows state officials to make arrests “with­\nout regard to federal priorities.” Brief for United States\n53. The Court’s opinion focuses on limits that Congress\nhas placed on federal officials’ authority to arrest remov­\nable aliens and the possibility that state officials will\nmake arrests “to achieve [Arizona’s] own immigration policy”\nand “without any input from the Federal Government.”\nAnte, at 17.\n  Of course on this pre-enforcement record there is no\nreason to assume that Arizona officials will ignore federal\nimmigration policy (unless it be the questionable policy of\nnot wanting to identify illegal aliens who have committed\noffenses that make them removable). As Arizona points\nout, federal law expressly provides that state officers may\n“cooperate with the Attorney General in the identification,\napprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully\npresent in the United States,” 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10)(B);\nand “cooperation” requires neither identical efforts nor\nprior federal approval. It is consistent with the Arizona\nstatute, and with the “cooperat[ive]” system that Congress\nhas created, for state officials to arrest a removable alien,\n12               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ncontact federal immigration authorities, and follow their\nlead on what to do next. And it is an assault on logic to\nsay that identifying a removable alien and holding him for\nfederal determination of whether he should be removed\n“violates the principle that the removal process is entrusted\nto the discretion of the Federal Government,” ante, at\n18. The State’s detention does not represent commence­\nment of the removal process unless the Federal Govern­\nment makes it so.\n   But that is not the most important point. The most\nimportant point is that, as we have discussed, Arizona is\nentitled to have “its own immigration policy”—including a\nmore rigorous enforcement policy—so long as that does not\nconflict with federal law. The Court says, as though the\npoint is utterly dispositive, that “it is not a crime for a\nremovable alien to remain present in the United States,”\nante, at 15. It is not a federal crime, to be sure. But there\nis no reason Arizona cannot make it a state crime for a\nremovable alien (or any illegal alien, for that matter) to\nremain present in Arizona.\n   The Court quotes 8 U. S. C. §1226(a), which provides\nthat, “[o]n a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an\nalien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on\nwhether the alien is to be removed from the United\nStates.” Section 1357(a)(2) also provides that a federal\nimmigration official “shall have power without warrant . . .\nto arrest any alien in the United States, if he has reason to\nbelieve that the alien so arrested is in the United States in\nviolation of any [federal immigration] law or regulation\nand is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for\nhis arrest.” But statutory limitations upon the actions of\nfederal officers in enforcing the United States’ power to\nprotect its borders do not on their face apply to the actions\nof state officers in enforcing the State’s power to protect its\nborders. There is no more reason to read these provisions\nas implying that state officials are subject to similar limi­\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ntations than there is to read them as implying that only\nfederal officials may arrest removable aliens. And in any\nevent neither implication would constitute the sort of clear\nelimination of the States’ sovereign power that our cases\ndemand.\n   The Court raises concerns about “unnecessary harass­\nment of some aliens . . . whom federal officials determine\nshould not be removed.” Ante, at 17. But we have no\nlicense to assume, without any support in the record, that\nArizona officials would use their arrest authority under §6\nto harass anyone. And it makes no difference that federal\nofficials might “determine [that some unlawfully present\naliens] should not be removed,” ibid. They may well de­\ntermine not to remove from the United States aliens who\nhave no right to be here; but unless and until these aliens\nhave been given the right to remain, Arizona is entitled to\narrest them and at least bring them to federal officials’\nattention, which is all that §6 necessarily entails. (In my\nview, the State can go further than this, and punish them\nfor their unlawful entry and presence in Arizona.)\n   The Government complains that state officials might not\nheed “federal priorities.” Indeed they might not, particu­\nlarly if those priorities include willful blindness or delib-\nerate inattention to the presence of removable aliens in\nArizona. The State’s whole complaint—the reason this\nlaw was passed and this case has arisen—is that the\ncitizens of Arizona believe federal priorities are too lax.\nThe State has the sovereign power to protect its borders\nmore rigorously if it wishes, absent any valid federal\nprohibition. The Executive’s policy choice of lax federal\nenforcement does not constitute such a prohibition.\n                              §3\n    “In addition to any violation of federal law, a person is\n    guilty of willful failure to complete or carry an alien\n    registration document if the person is in violation of 8\n14               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n     [U. S. C.] §1304(e) or §1306(a).” S. B. 1070, §3(A), as\n     amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–1509(A).\n   It is beyond question that a State may make violation of\nfederal law a violation of state law as well. We have held\nthat to be so even when the interest protected is a distinc­\ntively federal interest, such as protection of the dignity of\nthe national flag, see Halter v. Nebraska, 205 U. S. 34\n(1907), or protection of the Federal Government’s ability\nto recruit soldiers, Gilbert v. Minnesota, 254 U. S. 325\n(1920). “[T]he State is not inhibited from making the national\npurposes its own purposes to the extent of exerting its\npolice power to prevent its own citizens from obstructing\nthe accomplishment of such purposes.” Id., at 331 (inter­\nnal quotation marks omitted). Much more is that so when,\nas here, the State is protecting its own interest, the integ­\nrity of its borders. And we have said that explicitly with\nregard to illegal immigration: “Despite the exclusive fed­\neral control of this Nation’s borders, we cannot conclude\nthat the States are without any power to deter the influx\nof persons entering the United States against federal law,\nand whose numbers might have a discernible impact on\ntraditional state concerns.” Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202,\n228, n. 23 (1982).\n   The Court’s opinion relies upon Hines v. Davidowitz,\nsupra. Ante, at 9–10. But that case did not, as the Court\nbelieves, establish a “field preemption” that implicitly\neliminates the States’ sovereign power to exclude those\nwhom federal law excludes. It held that the States are not\npermitted to establish “additional or auxiliary” registra­\ntion requirements for aliens. 312 U. S., at 66–67. But §3\ndoes not establish additional or auxiliary registration\nrequirements. It merely makes a violation of state law the\nvery same failure to register and failure to carry evidence\nof registration that are violations of federal law. Hines\ndoes not prevent the State from relying on the federal\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nregistration system as “an available aid in the enforce­\nment of a number of statutes of the state applicable to\naliens whose constitutional validity has not been ques­\ntioned.” Id., at 75–76 (Stone, J., dissenting). One such\nstatute is Arizona’s law forbidding illegal aliens to collect\nunemployment benefits, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–781(B)\n(West 2012). To enforce that and other laws that validly\nturn on alien status, Arizona has, in Justice Stone’s words,\nan interest in knowing “the number and whereabouts of\naliens within the state” and in having “a means of their\nidentification,” 312 U. S., at 75. And it can punish the\naliens’ failure to comply with the provisions of federal law\nthat make that knowledge and identification possible.\n   In some areas of uniquely federal concern—e.g., fraud in\na federal administrative process (Buckman Co. v. Plain­\ntiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341 (2001)) or perjury in\nviolation of a federally required oath (In re Loney, 134\nU. S. 372 (1890))—this Court has held that a State has no\nlegitimate interest in enforcing a federal scheme. But the\nfederal alien registration system is certainly not of uniquely\nfederal interest. States, private entities, and individuals\nrely on the federal registration system (including the\nE-Verify program) on a regular basis. Arizona’s legitimate in­\nterest in protecting (among other things) its unemployment­\nbenefits system is an entirely adequate basis for making\nthe violation of federal registration and carry require­\nments a violation of state law as well.\n   The Court points out, however, ante, at 11, that in some\nrespects the state law exceeds the punishments prescribed\nby federal law: It rules out probation and pardon, which\nare available under federal law. The answer is that it\nmakes no difference. Illegal immigrants who violate §3\nviolate Arizona law. It is one thing to say that the Su­\npremacy Clause prevents Arizona law from excluding\nthose whom federal law admits. It is quite something else\nto say that a violation of Arizona law cannot be punished\n16               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nmore severely than a violation of federal law. Especially\nwhere (as here) the State is defending its own sovereign\ninterests, there is no precedent for such a limitation. The\nsale of illegal drugs, for example, ordinarily violates state\nlaw as well as federal law, and no one thinks that the\nstate penalties cannot exceed the federal. As I have dis­\ncussed, moreover, “field preemption” cannot establish a\nprohibition of additional state penalties in the area of\nimmigration.\n  Finally, the Government also suggests that §3 poses an\nobstacle to the administration of federal immigration law,\nsee Brief for United States 31–33, but “there is no conflict\nin terms, and no possibility of such conflict, [if] the state\nstatute makes federal law its own,” California v. Zook, 336\nU. S. 725, 735 (1949).\n  It holds no fear for me, as it does for the Court, that\n“[w]ere §3 to come into force, the State would have the\npower to bring criminal charges against individuals for\nviolating a federal law even in circumstances where fed-\neral officials in charge of the comprehensive scheme de­\ntermine that prosecution would frustrate federal policies.”\nAnte, at 11. That seems to me entirely appropriate when\nthe State uses the federal law (as it must) as the criterion\nfor the exercise of its own power, and the implementation\nof its own policies of excluding those who do not belong\nthere. What I do fear—and what Arizona and the States\nthat support it fear—is that “federal policies” of nonen­\nforcement will leave the States helpless before those evil\neffects of illegal immigration that the Court’s opinion\ndutifully recites in its prologue (ante, at 6) but leaves\nunremedied in its disposition.\n                            §5(C)\n     “It is unlawful for a person who is unlawfully present\n     in the United States and who is an unauthorized alien\n     to knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n    place or perform work as an employee or independent\n    contractor in this state.” S. B. 1070, §5(C), as amended,\n    Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–2928(C).\n   Here, the Court rightly starts with De Canas v. Bica,\n424 U. S. 351 (1976), which involved a California law\nproviding that “ ‘[n]o employer shall knowingly employ an\nalien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the United\nStates if such employment would have an adverse effect\non lawful resident workers.’ ” Id., at 352 (quoting Califor­\nnia Labor Code Ann. §2805(a)). This Court concluded that\nthe California law was not pre-empted, as Congress had\nneither occupied the field of “regulation of employment of\nillegal aliens” nor expressed “the clear and manifest pur­\npose” of displacing such state regulation. Id., at 356–357\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, at the time\nDe Canas was decided, §5(C) would have been indubitably\nlawful.\n   The only relevant change is that Congress has since\nenacted its own restrictions on employers who hire illegal\naliens, 8 U. S. C. §1324a, in legislation that also includes\nsome civil (but no criminal) penalties on illegal aliens who\naccept unlawful employment. The Court concludes from\nthis (reasonably enough) “that Congress made a deliberate\nchoice not to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek,\nor engage in, unauthorized employment,” ante, at 13. But\nthat is not the same as a deliberate choice to prohibit\nthe States from imposing criminal penalties. Congress’s\nintent with regard to exclusion of state law need not be\nguessed at, but is found in the law’s express pre-emption\nprovision, which excludes “any State or local law impos-\ning civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licens­\ning and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit\nor refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens,”\n§1324a(h)(2) (emphasis added). Common sense, reflected\nin the canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius, suggests\n18               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthat the specification of pre-emption for laws punishing\n“those who employ” implies the lack of pre-emption for\nother laws, including laws punishing “those who seek or\naccept employment.”\n  The Court has no credible response to this. It quotes\nour jurisprudence to the effect that an “express pre­\nemption provisio[n] does not bar the ordinary working of\nconflict pre-emption principles.” Ante, at 14 (quoting Geier\nv. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 869\n(2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)). True enough—\nconflict preemption principles. It then goes on say that\nsince “Congress decided it would be inappropriate to im­\npose criminal penalties on aliens who seek or engage in\nunauthorized employment,” “[i]t follows that a state law to\nthe contrary is an obstacle to the regulatory system Con­\ngress chose.” Ante, at 15. For “ ‘[w]here a comprehensive\nfederal scheme intentionally leaves a portion of the regu­\nlated field without controls, then the pre-emptive inference\ncan be drawn.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Puerto Rico Dept. of Con­\nsumer Affairs v. ISLA Petroleum Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/scotus/ziH/puerto-rico-dept-of-consumer-affairs-v-isla-petrol/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 503\n(1988)). All that is a classic description not of conflict\npre-emption but of field pre-emption, which (concededly)\ndoes not occur beyond the terms of an express pre-emption\nprovision.\n  The Court concludes that §5(C) “would interfere with\nthe careful balance struck by Congress,” ante, at 15, (an­\nother field pre-emption notion, by the way) but that is easy\nto say and impossible to demonstrate. The Court relies\nprimarily on the fact that “[p]roposals to make unauthor­\nized work a criminal offense were debated and discussed\nduring the long process of drafting [the Immigration Re­\nform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA)],” “[b]ut Congress\nrejected them.” Ante, at 14. There is no more reason to\nbelieve that this rejection was expressive of a desire that\nthere be no sanctions on employees, than expressive of a\ndesire that such sanctions be left to the States.

It is a “naïve assumption\nthat the failure of a bill to make it out of committee, or\nto be adopted when reported to the floor, is the same\nas a congressional rejection of what the bill contained.”\nCrosby v.

Despite\nCongress’s prescription that “the immigration laws of the\nUnited States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly,”\nIRCA §115, 100 Stat. 3384, Arizona asserts without\ncontradiction and with supporting citations:\n    “[I]n the last decade federal enforcement efforts have\n    focused primarily on areas in California and Texas,\n    leaving Arizona’s border to suffer from comparative\n    neglect. The result has been the funneling of an in­\n    creasing tide of illegal border crossings into Arizona.\n    Indeed, over the past decade, over a third of the Na­\n    tion’s illegal border crossings occurred in Arizona.”\n    Brief for Petitioners 2–3 (footnote omitted).\nMust Arizona’s ability to protect its borders yield to the\nreality that Congress has provided inadequate funding for\nfederal enforcement—or, even worse, to the Executive’s\nunwise targeting of that funding?\n20                  ARIZONA v.

It has become clear that federal\nenforcement priorities—in the sense of priorities based on\nthe need to allocate “scarce enforcement resources”—is not\nthe problem here. After this case was argued and while\nit was under consideration, the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity announced a program exempting from immi-\ngration enforcement some 1.4 million illegal immigrants\nunder the age of 30.4 If an individual unlawfully present\nin the United States\n     “• came to the United States under the age of sixteen;\n     “• has continuously resided in the United States for\n        at least five years . . . ,\n     “• is currently in school, has graduated from high\n        school, has obtained a general education develop­\n        ment certificate, or is an honorably discharged\n        veteran . . . ,\n     “• has not been convicted of a [serious crime]; and\n     “• is not above the age of thirty,”5\nthen U.

The President said at a\nnews conference that the new program is “the right thing\nto do” in light of Congress’s failure to pass the Administra­\ntion’s proposed revision of the Immigration Act.7 Perhaps\nit is, though Arizona may not think so. But to say, as the\nCourt does, that Arizona contradicts federal law by enforc­\ning applications of the Immigration Act that the President\ndeclines to enforce boggles the mind.\n   The Court opinion’s looming specter of inutterable hor­\nror—“[i]f §3 of the Arizona statute were valid, every State\ncould give itself independent authority to prosecute fed-\neral registration violations,” ante, at 10—seems to me not\nso horrible and even less looming. But there has come to\npass, and is with us today, the specter that Arizona and\nthe States that support it predicted: A Federal Govern­\nment that does not want to enforce the immigration laws\nas written, and leaves the States’ borders unprotected\nagainst immigrants whom those laws would exclude. So\nthe issue is a stark one. Are the sovereign States at the\nmercy of the Federal Executive’s refusal to enforce the\nNation’s immigration laws?\n   A good way of answering that question is to ask: Would\nthe States conceivably have entered into the Union if the\nConstitution itself contained the Court’s holding? Today’s\njudgment surely fails that test. At the Constitutional\nConvention of 1787, the delegates contended with “the\njealousy of the states with regard to their sovereignty.” 1\nRecords of the Federal Convention 19 (M.

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nguarded—as reflected in the innumerable proposals that\nnever left Independence Hall. Now, imagine a provision—\nperhaps inserted right after Art. I, §8, cl. 4, the Naturali­\nzation Clause—which included among the enumerated\npowers of Congress “To establish Limitations upon Immi­\ngration that will be exclusive and that will be enforced\nonly to the extent the President deems appropriate.” The\ndelegates to the Grand Convention would have rushed to\nthe exits.\n   As is often the case, discussion of the dry legalities that\nare the proper object of our attention suppresses the very\nhuman realities that gave rise to the suit. Arizona bears\nthe brunt of the country’s illegal immigration problem. Its\ncitizens feel themselves under siege by large numbers of\nillegal immigrants who invade their property, strain their\nsocial services, and even place their lives in jeopardy.\nFederal officials have been unable to remedy the problem,\nand indeed have recently shown that they are unwilling to\ndo so. Thousands of Arizona’s estimated 400,000 illegal\nimmigrants—including not just children but men and\nwomen under 30—are now assured immunity from en­\nforcement, and will be able to compete openly with Ari­\nzona citizens for employment.\n   Arizona has moved to protect its sovereignty—not in\ncontradiction of federal law, but in complete compliance\nwith it. The laws under challenge here do not extend or\nrevise federal immigration restrictions, but merely enforce\nthose restrictions more effectively. If securing its territory\nin this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we\nshould cease referring to it as a sovereign State. I dissent.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

B. 1070. I reach that conclusion, however, for the sim-\nple reason that there is no conflict between the “ordinary\nmeanin[g]” of the relevant federal laws and that of the\nfour provisions of Arizona law at issue here. Wyeth v.\nLevine, 555 U. S. 555, 588 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring\nin judgment) (“Pre-emption analysis should not be a free-\nwheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in\ntension with federal objectives, but an inquiry into whether\nthe ordinary meanings of state and federal law conflict”\n(brackets; internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Section 2(B) of S. B. 1070 provides that, when Arizona\nlaw enforcement officers reasonably suspect that a person\nthey have lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested is unlaw-\nfully present, “a reasonable attempt shall be made, when\npracticable, to determine the immigration status of the\nperson” pursuant to the verification procedure established\nby Congress in 8 U.

Nothing in the text of that or\nany other federal statute prohibits Arizona from directing\nits officers to make immigration-related inquiries in these\nsituations.

S. C. §1644. And, federal\nlaw imposes an affirmative obligation on federal officials\nto respond to a State’s immigration-related inquiries.\n§1373(c).\n   Section 6 of S. B. 1070 authorizes Arizona law enforce-\nment officers to make warrantless arrests when there is\nprobable cause to believe that an arrestee has committed a\npublic offense that renders him removable under federal\nimmigration law. States, as sovereigns, have inherent\nauthority to conduct arrests for violations of federal law,\nunless and until Congress removes that authority. See\nUnited States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 589 (1948) (holding\nthat state law determines the validity of a warrantless\narrest for a violation of federal law “in the absence of\nan applicable federal statute”). Here, no federal statute\npurports to withdraw that authority. As JUSTICE SCALIA\nnotes, ante, at 12 (opinion concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part), federal law does limit the authority of federal\nofficials to arrest removable aliens, but those statutes do\nnot apply to state officers. And, federal law expressly\nrecognizes that state officers may “cooperate with the\nAttorney General” in the “apprehension” and “detention”\nof “aliens not lawfully present in the United States.”\n§1357(g)(10)(B). Nothing in that statute indicates that\nsuch cooperation requires a prior “request, approval, or\nother instruction from the Federal Government.” Ante, at\n18 (majority opinion).\n   Section 3 of S.

Section 3 simply\nincorporates federal registration standards. Unlike the\nCourt, I would not hold that Congress pre-empted the field\nof enforcing those standards. “[O]ur recent cases have\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

Here, nothing in the text of the relevant federal\nstatutes indicates that Congress intended enforcement of\nits registration requirements to be exclusively the prov-\nince of the Federal Government. That Congress created a\n“full set of standards governing alien registration,” ante, at\n10 (majority opinion), merely indicates that it intended the\nscheme to be capable of working on its own, not that it\nwanted to preclude the States from enforcing the federal\nstandards. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52 (1941), is not\nto the contrary. As JUSTICE SCALIA explains, ante, at 14,\nHines at most holds that federal law pre-empts the States\nfrom creating additional registration requirements. But\nhere, Arizona is merely seeking to enforce the very regis-\ntration requirements that Congress created.\n   Section 5(C) of S. B. 1070 prohibits unlawfully present\naliens from knowingly applying for, soliciting, or perform-\ning work in Arizona. Section 5(C) operates only on indi-\nviduals whom Congress has already declared ineligible to\nwork in the United States. Nothing in the text of the\nfederal immigration laws prohibits States from imposing\ntheir own criminal penalties on such individuals. Fed-\neral law expressly pre-empts States from “imposing civil or\ncriminal sanctions (other than through licensing and\nsimilar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer\nfor a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.” 8 U. S. C.\n§1324a(h)(2) (emphasis added). But it leaves States free\nto impose criminal sanctions on the employees themselves.\n   Despite the lack of any conflict between the ordinary\nmeaning of the Arizona law and that of the federal laws at\nissue here, the Court holds that various provisions of the\nArizona law are pre-empted because they “stan[d] as an\n4               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\npurposes and objectives of Congress.” Hines, supra, at 67.\nI have explained that the “purposes and objectives” theory\nof implied pre-emption is inconsistent with the Constitu-\ntion because it invites courts to engage in freewheeling\nspeculation about congressional purpose that roams well\nbeyond statutory text. See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 604 (opin-\nion concurring in judgment); see also Williamson v. Mazda\nMotor of America, Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (opin-\nion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2–3); Haywood v.\nDrown, 556 U. S. 729, 767 (2009) (dissenting opinion).\nUnder the Supremacy Clause, pre-emptive effect is to be\ngiven to congressionally enacted laws, not to judicially\ndivined legislative purposes. See Wyeth, supra, at 604\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). Thus, even assum-\ning the existence of some tension between Arizona’s law\nand the supposed “purposes and objectives” of Congress, I\nwould not hold that any of the provisions of the Arizona\nlaw at issue here are pre-empted on that basis.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

B.\n1070. Section 2(B) requires Arizona law enforcement\nofficers to make a “reasonable attempt,” “when practica-\nble,” to ascertain the immigration status of any person\nwhom an officer lawfully stops, detains, or arrests “where\nreasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and\nis unlawfully present in the United States.” Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §11–1051(B) (West 2012). Section 3 provides\nthat an alien who willfully fails “to complete or carry an\nalien registration document” in violation of 8 U. S. C.\n§1304(e) or §1306(a) is guilty of a misdemeanor. Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §13–1509(A) (West Supp. 2011). Section 5(C)\nmakes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien who\nis unlawfully present in the United States “to knowingly\napply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform\nwork as an employee or independent contractor.” Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §13–2928(C). And §6 authorizes Arizona\nlaw enforcement officers to arrest without a warrant any\nperson whom the officer has probable cause to believe “has\ncommitted any public offense that makes the person re-\nmovable from the United States.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§13–3883(A)(5).\n   I agree with the Court that §2(B) is not pre-empted.\n2                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nThat provision does not authorize or require Arizona law\nenforcement officers to do anything they are not already\nallowed to do under existing federal law. The United\nStates’ argument that §2(B) is pre-empted, not by any\nfederal statute or regulation, but simply by the Executive’s\ncurrent enforcement policy is an astounding assertion of\nfederal executive power that the Court rightly rejects.\n   I also agree with the Court that §3 is pre-empted by\nvirtue of our decision in Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S.\n52 (1941). Our conclusion in that case that Congress had\nenacted an “all-embracing system” of alien registration\nand that States cannot “enforce additional or auxiliary\nregulations,” id., at 66–67, 74, forecloses Arizona’s attempt\nhere to impose additional, state-law penalties for viola-\ntions of the federal registration scheme.\n   While I agree with the Court on §2(B) and §3, I part\nways on §5(C) and §6. The Court’s holding on §5(C) is\ninconsistent with De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351 (1976),\nwhich held that employment regulation, even of aliens\nunlawfully present in the country, is an area of traditional\nstate concern. Because state police powers are implicated\nhere, our precedents require us to presume that federal\nlaw does not displace state law unless Congress’ intent to\ndo so is clear and manifest. I do not believe Congress has\nspoken with the requisite clarity to justify invalidation of\n§5(C). Nor do I believe that §6 is invalid. Like §2(B), §6\nadds virtually nothing to the authority that Arizona law\nenforcement officers already exercise. And whatever little\nauthority they have gained is consistent with federal law.\n                       Section 2(B)\n                             A\n  Although §2(B) of the Arizona law has occasioned much\ncontroversy, it adds nothing to the authority that Arizona\nlaw enforcement officers, like officers in all other States,\nalready possess under federal law. For that reason, I\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nagree with the Court that §2(B) is not pre-empted.\n   Section 2(B) quite clearly does not expand the authority\nof Arizona officers to make stops or arrests. It is triggered\nonly when a “lawful stop, detention or arrest [is] made . . .\nin the enforcement of any other [state or local] law or\nordinance.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(B) (emphasis\nadded). Section 2(B) thus comes into play only when\nan officer has reasonable suspicion or probable cause to\nbelieve that a person has committed a nonimmigration\noffense. Arizona officers plainly possessed this authority\nbefore §2(B) took effect.\n   Section 2(B) also does not expand the authority of Ari-\nzona officers to inquire about the immigration status of\npersons who are lawfully detained. When a person is\nstopped or arrested and “reasonable suspicion exists that\nthe person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the\nUnited States,” §2(B) instructs Arizona officers to make a\n“reasonable attempt,” “when practicable,” to ascertain that\nperson’s immigration status. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–\n1051(B). Even before the Arizona Legislature enacted\n§2(B), federal law permitted state and local officers to\nmake such inquiries. In 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10)(A), Con-\ngress has made clear that state and local governments\nneed not enter into formal agreements with the Federal\nGovernment in order “to communicate with the [Federal\nGovernment] regarding the immigration status of any\nindividual.” In addition, Congress has mandated that\nneither the Federal Government nor any state or local\ngovernment may “prohibit, or in any way restrict, any\ngovernment entity or official from sending to, or receiving\nfrom, [the Federal Government] information regarding the\ncitizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of\nany individual.” §1373(a); see also §1644 (providing that\n“no State or local government entity may be prohibited,\nor in any way restricted, from sending to or receiving\nfrom [the Federal Government] information regarding the\n4               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nimmigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an alien in the\nUnited States”). And while these provisions preserve the\nauthority of state and local officers to seek immigration-\nstatus information from the Federal Government, another\nfederal statute, §1373(c), requires that the Federal Gov-\nernment respond to any such inquiries “by providing the\nrequested verification or status information.” It comes\nas no surprise, therefore, that many States and localities\npermit their law enforcement officers to make the kinds of\ninquiries that §2(B) prescribes. See App. 294–298 (report-\ning that officers in 59 surveyed state and local jurisdic-\ntions “generally” ask arrestees about their immigration\nstatus while 34 do not and that officers in 78 jurisdictions\n“generally” inform Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(ICE) when they believe an arrestee to be an undocumented\nalien while only 17 do not). Congress has invited state\nand local governments to make immigration-related in-\nquiries and has even obligated the Federal Government to\nrespond. Through §2(B), Arizona has taken Congress up\non that invitation.\n   The United States does not deny that officers may, at\ntheir own discretion, inquire about the immigration status\nof persons whom they lawfully detain. Instead, the United\nStates argues that §2(B) is pre-empted because it impedes\nfederal-state cooperation by mandating that officers verify\nthe immigration status of every detained person if there is\nreason to believe that the person is unlawfully present in\nthe country. The United States claims that §2(B)’s man-\ndate runs contrary to federal law in that it “precludes\nofficers from taking [the Federal Government’s] priorities\nand discretion into account.” Brief for United States\n50. “[B]y interposing a mandatory state law between state\nand local officers and their federal counterparts,” writes\nthe United States, §2(B) “stands as an obstacle to the ac-\ncomplishment of the federal requirement of cooperation\nand the full effectuation of the enforcement judgment and\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ndiscretion Congress has vested in the Executive Branch.”\nIbid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n   The underlying premise of the United States’ argument\nseems to be that state and local officers, when left to their\nown devices, generally take federal enforcement priorities\ninto account. But there is no reason to think that this\npremise is true. And even if it were, it would not follow\nthat §2(B)’s blanket mandate is at odds with federal law.\nNothing in the relevant federal statutes requires state and\nlocal officers to consider the Federal Government’s priori-\nties before requesting verification of a person’s immigra-\ntion status. Neither 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10) nor §1373(a)\nconditions the right of state and local officers to communi-\ncate with the Federal Government on their first taking\naccount of its priorities. Nor does §1373(c) condition the\nFederal Government’s obligation to answer requests for in-\nformation on the sensitivity of state and local officers to\nits enforcement discretion. In fact, §1373(c) dictates that\nthe Federal Government “shall respond” to any inquiry\nseeking verification of immigration status, and that com-\nmand applies whether or not the requesting officer has\nbothered to consider federal priorities. Because no federal\nstatute requires such consideration, §2(B) does not conflict\nwith federal law.\n   In any event, it is hard to see how state and local offi-\ncers could proceed in conformity with the Federal Govern-\nment’s enforcement priorities without making an inquiry\ninto a suspected alien’s immigration status. For example,\none of the Federal Government’s highest priorities is the\napprehension and removal of aliens who have failed to\ncomply with a final order of removal. See App. 108. How\ncan an officer identify those persons without first in-\nquiring about their status? At bottom, the discretion\nthat ultimately matters is not whether to verify a person’s\nimmigration status but whether to act once the person’s\nstatus is known. For that reason, §2(B)’s verification\n6                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nrequirement is not contrary to federal law because the\nFederal Government retains the discretion that matters\nmost––that is, the discretion to enforce the law in par-\nticular cases. If an Arizona officer contacts the Federal\nGovernment to verify a person’s immigration status and\nfederal records reveal that the person is in the coun-\ntry unlawfully, the Federal Government decides, presum-\nably based on its enforcement priorities, whether to have\nthe person released or transferred to federal custody.\nEnforcement discretion thus lies with the Federal Gov-\nernment, not with Arizona. Nothing in §2(B) suggests\notherwise.\n   The United States’ attack on §2(B) is quite remarkable.\nThe United States suggests that a state law may be pre-\nempted, not because it conflicts with a federal statute or\nregulation, but because it is inconsistent with a federal\nagency’s current enforcement priorities. Those priorities,\nhowever, are not law. They are nothing more than agency\npolicy. I am aware of no decision of this Court recognizing\nthat mere policy can have pre-emptive force. Cf.

If accepted, the United States’\npre-emption argument would give the Executive unprece-\ndented power to invalidate state laws that do not meet\nwith its approval, even if the state laws are otherwise\nconsistent with federal statutes and duly promulgated\nregulations. This argument, to say the least, is fundamen-\ntally at odds with our federal system.\n                               B\n   It has been suggested that §2(B) will cause some per-\nsons who are lawfully stopped to be detained in violation\nof their constitutional rights while a prolonged investiga-\ntion of their immigration status is undertaken. But noth-\ning on the face of the law suggests that it will be enforced\nin a way that violates the Fourth Amendment or any other\nprovision of the Constitution. The law instructs officers to\nmake a “reasonable attempt” to investigate immigration\nstatus, and this language is best understood as incorporat-\ning the Fourth Amendment’s standard of reasonableness.\nIndeed, the Arizona Legislature has directed that §2(B)\n“shall be implemented in a manner consistent with federal\nlaws . . . protecting the civil rights of all persons and re-\nspecting the privileges and immunities of United States\ncitizens.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(L).\n   In the situations that seem most likely to occur, en-\nforcement of §2(B) will present familiar Fourth Amend-\nment questions. To take a common situation, suppose that\na car is stopped for speeding, a nonimmigration offense.\n(Recall that §2(B) comes into play only where a stop or\narrest is made for a nonimmigration offense.) Suppose\n8                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nalso that the officer who makes the stop subsequently\nacquires reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver\nentered the country illegally, which is a federal crime. See\n8 U. S. C. §1325(a).\n   It is well established that state and local officers gener-\nally have authority to make stops and arrests for viola-\ntions of federal criminal laws. See, e.g., Miller v. United\nStates, 357 U. S. 301, 305 (1958); United States v. Di Re,\n332 U. S. 581, 589 (1948). I see no reason why this princi-\nple should not apply to immigration crimes as well. Lower\ncourts have so held. See, e.g., Estrada v. Rhode Island,\n594 F. 3d 56, 65 (CA1 2010) (upholding the lawfulness of\na detention because the officer had an objectively reason-\nable belief that the arrestees “had committed immigra-\ntion violations”); United States v. Vasquez-Alvarez, 176\nF. 3d 1294, 1296 (CA10 1999) (noting that “state law-\nenforcement officers have the general authority to investi-\ngate and make arrests for violations of federal immigra-\ntion laws”); Gonzales v. Peoria, 722 F. 2d 468, 475 (CA9\n1983), overruled on other grounds, Hodgers-Durgin v. de\nla Vina, 199 F. 3d 1037 (1999) (en banc) (holding that\n“federal law does not preclude local enforcement of the\ncriminal provisions” of federal immigration law). And the\nUnited States, consistent with the position long taken by\nthe Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of\nJustice, does not contend otherwise. See Brief for United\nStates 55, n. 33; see also Memorandum from OLC to the\nAttorney General (Apr. 3, 2002), App. 268–273; Assistance\nby State and Local Police in Apprehending Illegal Aliens,\n20 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 26 (1996).\n   More importantly, no federal statute casts doubt on this\nauthority. To be sure, there are a handful of statutes that\npurport to authorize state and local officers to make immi-\ngration-related arrests in certain situations. See, e.g., 8\nU. S. C. §1103(a)(10) (providing for the extension of “any”\nimmigration enforcement authority to state and local\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nofficers in the event of an “actual or imminent mass in-\nflux of aliens arriving off the coast”); §1252c(a) (provid-\ning authority to arrest criminal aliens who had illegally\nreentered the country but only after consultation with\nthe Federal Government); §1324(c) (providing authority\nto make arrests for transporting and harboring certain\naliens). But a grant of federal arrest authority in some\ncases does not manifest a clear congressional intent to\ndisplace the States’ police powers in all other cases. With-\nout more, such an inference is too weak to overcome our\npresumption against pre-emption where traditional state\npolice powers are at stake. Accordingly, in our hypothet-\nical case, the Arizona officer may arrest the driver for\nviolating §1325(a) if the officer has probable cause. And if\nthe officer has reasonable suspicion, the officer may detain\nthe driver, to the extent permitted by the Fourth Amend-\nment, while the question of illegal entry is investigated.\n   We have held that a detention based on reasonable\nsuspicion that the detainee committed a particular crime\n“can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time\nreasonably required to complete that mission.” Illinois v.\nCaballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407 (2005). But if during the\ncourse of a stop an officer acquires suspicion that a de-\ntainee committed a different crime, the detention may be\nextended for a reasonable time to verify or dispel that\nsuspicion. Cf. Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 101 (2005)\n(holding that “no additional Fourth Amendment justifica-\ntion” was required because any questioning concerning\nimmigration status did not prolong the detention). In our\nhypothetical case, therefore, if the officer, after initially\nstopping the car for speeding, has a reasonable suspicion\nthat the driver entered the country illegally, the officer\nmay investigate for evidence of illegal entry. But the\nlength and nature of this investigation must remain with-\nin the limits set out in our Fourth Amendment cases. An\ninvestigative stop, if prolonged, can become an arrest and\n10                 ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthus require probable cause. See Caballes, supra, at 407.\nSimilarly, if a person is moved from the site of the stop,\nprobable cause will likely be required. See Hayes v. Florida,\n470 U. S. 811, 816 (1985) (holding that the line be-\ntween detention and arrest is crossed “when the police,\nwithout probable cause or a warrant, forcibly remove a\nperson from his home or other place in which he is entitled\nto be and transport him to the police station, where he is\ndetained, although briefly, for investigative purposes”).\n   If properly implemented, §2(B) should not lead to fed-\neral constitutional violations, but there is no denying that\nenforcement of §2(B) will multiply the occasions on which\nsensitive Fourth Amendment issues will crop up. These\ncivil-liberty concerns, I take it, are at the heart of most\nobjections to §2(B). Close and difficult questions will in-\nevitably arise as to whether an officer had reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that a person who is stopped for some\nother reason entered the country illegally, and there is a\nrisk that citizens, lawful permanent residents, and others\nwho are lawfully present in the country will be detained.\nTo mitigate this risk, Arizona could issue guidance to\nofficers detailing the circumstances that typically give\nrise to reasonable suspicion of unlawful presence. And in\nthe spirit of the federal-state cooperation that the United\nStates champions, the Federal Government could share its\nown guidelines. Arizona could also provide officers with a\nnonexclusive list containing forms of identification suffi-\ncient under §2(B) to dispel any suspicion of unlawful\npresence. If Arizona accepts licenses from most States as\nproof of legal status, the problem of roadside detentions\nwill be greatly mitigated.1\n——————\n  1 When the Real ID Act takes effect, the Federal Government will no\n\nlonger accept state forms of identification that fail to meet certain\nfederal requirements. §202(a)(1), 119 Stat. 312.

Although\nthere is some ambiguity in Hines, the Court largely spoke\nin the language of field pre-emption. The Court explained\nthat where Congress “has enacted a complete scheme of\nregulation and has therein provided a standard for the\nregistration of aliens, states cannot, inconsistently with\nthe purpose of Congress, conflict or interfere with, curtail\nor complement, the federal law, or enforce additional or\nauxiliary regulations.” 312 U. S., at 66–67. In finding the\nPennsylvania alien-registration law pre-empted, the Court\nobserved that Congress had “provided a standard for\nalien registration in a single integrated and all-embracing\nsystem” and that its intent was “to protect the personal\nliberties of law-abiding aliens through one uniform na-\ntional registration system.” Id., at 74. If we credit our\nholding in Hines that Congress has enacted “a single in-\ntegrated and all-embracing system” of alien registration\nand that States cannot “complement” that system or “en-\nforce additional or auxiliary regulations,” id., at 66–67, 74,\nthen Arizona’s attempt to impose additional, state-law\npenalties for violations of federal registration require-\nments must be invalidated.\n                       Section 5(C)\n  While I agree that §3 is pre-empted, I disagree with the\nCourt’s decision to strike down §5(C). I do so in large\nmeasure because the Court fails to give the same solici-\ntude to our decision in De Canas, 424 U. S. 351, as it is\nwilling to give our decision in Hines. In De Canas, the\nCourt upheld against a pre-emption challenge a state law\nimposing fines on employers that hired aliens who were\n\n—————— \n\nanticipate that most, if not all, States will eventually issue forms of\n\n\nidentification that suffice to establish lawful presence under §2(B). \n\n12              ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nunlawfully present in the United States. The Court ex-\nplained that the mere fact that “aliens are the subject of a\nstate statute does not render it a regulation of immigra-\ntion.” 424 U. S., at 355. The Court emphasized instead\nthat “States possess broad authority under their police\npowers to regulate the employment relationship to protect\nworkers within the State.” Id., at 356. In light of that\nbroad authority, the Court declared that “[o]nly a demon-\nstration that complete ouster of state power . . . was ‘the\nclear and manifest purpose of Congress’ would justify” the\nconclusion that “state regulation designed to protect vital\nstate interests must give way to paramount federal legis-\nlation.” Id., at 357 (some internal quotation marks omit-\nted); see also Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S.\n431, 449 (2005) (“In areas of traditional state regulation,\n[the Court] assume[s] that a federal statute has not sup-\nplanted state law unless Congress has made such an\nintention ‘clear and manifest’ ” (some internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   The Court now tells us that times have changed. Since\nDe Canas, Congress has enacted “a comprehensive frame-\nwork for combating the employment of illegal aliens,” and\neven though aliens who seek or obtain unauthorized work\nare not subject to criminal sanctions, they can suffer civil\npenalties. Ante, at 12–13 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Undoubtedly, federal regulation in this area is\nmore pervasive today. But our task remains unchanged:\nto determine whether the federal scheme discloses a clear\nand manifest congressional intent to displace state law.\n   The Court gives short shrift to our presumption against\npre-emption. Having no express statement of congres-\nsional intent to support its analysis, the Court infers from\nstale legislative history and from the comprehensiveness\nof the federal scheme that “Congress made a deliberate\nchoice not to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek,\nor engage in, unauthorized employment.” Ante, at 13.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nBecause §5(C) imposes such penalties, the Court concludes\nthat it stands as an obstacle to the method of enforcement\nchosen by Congress. Ante, at 15.\n   The one thing that is clear from the federal scheme is\nthat Congress chose not to impose federal criminal penal-\nties on aliens who seek or obtain unauthorized work. But\nthat does not mean that Congress also chose to pre-empt\nstate criminal penalties. The inference is plausible, but\nfar from necessary. As we have said before, the “decision\nnot to adopt a regulation” is not “the functional equivalent\nof a regulation prohibiting all States and their political\nsubdivisions from adopting such a regulation.” Sprietsma\nv. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 65 (2002). With any\nstatutory scheme, Congress chooses to do some things and\nnot others. If that alone were enough to demonstrate pre-\nemptive intent, there would be little left over for the\nStates to regulate, especially now that federal authority\nreaches so far and wide. States would occupy tiny islands\nin a sea of federal power. This explains why state laws\nimplicating traditional state powers are not pre-empted\nunless there is a “clear and manifest” congressional inten-\ntion to do so.\n   Not only is there little evidence that Congress intended\nto pre-empt state laws like §5(C), there is some evidence\nthat Congress intended the opposite result. In making it\nunlawful for employers to hire unauthorized aliens, see 8\nU. S. C. §1324a(a), Congress made it clear that “any State\nor local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other\nthan through licensing and similar laws)” upon employers\nwas pre-empted, §1324a(h)(2). Noticeably absent is any\nsimilar directive pre-empting state or local laws targeting\naliens who seek or obtain unauthorized employment.\nGiven that Congress expressly pre-empted certain state\nand local laws pertaining to employers but remained silent\nabout laws pertaining to employees, one could infer that\nCongress intended to preserve state and local authority to\n14              ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nregulate the employee side of the equation. At the very\nleast, it raises serious doubts about whether Congress\nintended to pre-empt such authority.\n   The Court dismisses any inferences that might be\ndrawn from the express pre-emption provision. See ante,\nat 14. But even though the existence of that provision\n“does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption\nprinciples” or impose a “ ‘special burden’ ” against pre-\nemption, Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S.\n861, 869–870 (2000), it is still probative of congressional\nintent. And it is the intent of Congress that is the “ulti-\nmate touchstone.” Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375\nU. S. 96, 103 (1963).\n   The Court infers from Congress’ decision not to impose\nfederal criminal penalties that Congress intended to pre-\nempt state criminal penalties. But given that the express\npre-emption provision covers only state and local laws\nregulating employers, one could just as well infer that\nCongress did not intend to pre-empt state or local laws\naimed at alien employees who unlawfully seek or obtain\nwork. Surely Congress’ decision not to extend its express\npre-emption provision to state or local laws like §5(C) is\nmore probative of its intent on the subject of pre-emption\nthan its decision not to impose federal criminal penalties\nfor unauthorized work. In any event, the point I wish\nto emphasize is that inferences can be drawn either way.\nThere are no necessary inferences that point decisively for\nor against pre-emption. Therefore, if we take seriously\nthat state employment regulation is a traditional state\nconcern and can be pre-empted only on a showing of\n“clear and manifest” congressional intent as required by De\nCanas, then §5(C) must survive. “Our precedents estab-\nlish that a high threshold must be met if a state law is to\nbe pre-empted for conflicting with the purposes of a fed-\neral Act.” Chamber of Commerce of United States of America\nv.

I do\nnot believe the United States has surmounted that barrier\nhere.\n                          Section 6\n   I also disagree with the Court’s decision that §6 is pre-\nempted. This provision adds little to the authority that\nArizona officers already possess, and whatever additional\nauthority it confers is consistent with federal law. Section\n6 amended an Arizona statute that authorizes warrantless\narrests. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. §13–3883 (West 2010). Be-\nfore §6 was added, that statute already permitted arrests\nwithout a warrant for felonies, misdemeanors committed\nin the arresting officer’s presence, petty offenses, and\ncertain traffic-related criminal violations.      See §§13–\n3883(A)(1)–(4). Largely duplicating the authority already\nconferred by these prior subsections, §6 added a new\nsubsection, §13–3883(A)(5) (West Supp. 2011), that au-\nthorizes officers to make warrantless arrests on probable\ncause that the arrestee has committed a “public offense”\nfor which the arrestee is removable from the United\nStates. A “public offense” is defined as conduct that is\npunishable by imprisonment or a fine according to the law\nof the State where the conduct occurred and that would be\npunishable under Arizona law had the conduct occurred in\nArizona. See §13–105(27).\n   In what way, if any, does §6 enlarge the arrest authority\nof Arizona officers? It has been suggested that §6 confers\nnew authority in the following three circumstances: (1)\nwhere the arrestee committed but has not been charged\nwith committing an offense in another State; (2) where the\nofficer has probable cause to believe the arrestee commit-\nted an offense for which he was previously arrested but\nnot prosecuted; and (3) where the arrestee committed but\nhas already served the sentence for a removable offense.\n641 F. 3d 359, 361 (CA9 2011). These are exceedingly\n16               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nnarrow categories, involving circumstances that will rarely\narise. But such cases are possible, and therefore we must\ndecide whether there are circumstances under which fed-\neral law precludes a state officer from making an arrest\nbased on probable cause that the arrestee committed a\nremovable offense.\n                              A\n   The idea that state and local officers may carry out\narrests in the service of federal law is not unprecedented.\nAs previously noted, our cases establish that state and\nlocal officers may make warrantless arrests for violations\nof federal law and that “in the absence of an applicable\nfederal statute the law of the state where an arrest with-\nout warrant takes place determines its validity.” Di Re,\n332 U. S., at 589; see also Miller, 357 U. S., at 305 (stating\nthat, where a state officer makes an arrest based on fed-\neral law, “the lawfulness of the arrest without warrant\nis to be determined by reference to state law”). Therefore,\ngiven the premise, which I understand both the United\nStates and the Court to accept, that state and local officers\ndo have inherent authority to make arrests in aid of fed-\neral law, we must ask whether Congress has done anything\nto curtail or pre-empt that authority in this particular\ncase.\n   Neither the United States nor the Court goes so far as to\nsay that state and local officers have no power to arrest\ncriminal aliens based on their removability. To do so\nwould fly in the face of 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10). Under\n§§1357(g)(1)–(9), the Federal Government may enter into\nformal agreements with States and municipalities under\nwhich their officers may perform certain duties of a fed-\neral immigration officer. But §1357(g)(10)(B) makes clear\nthat States and municipalities need not enter into those\nagreements “otherwise to cooperate . . . in the identifica-\ntion, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                17\n\n                         Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nlawfully present in the United States.” It goes without\nsaying that state and local officers could not provide\nmeaningful cooperation in the apprehension, detention,\nand ultimate removal of criminal aliens without some\npower to make arrests.\n  Although §1357(g)(10) contemplates state and local\nauthority to apprehend criminal aliens for the purpose of\nremoval, the Court rejects out of hand any possibility that\nofficers could exercise that authority without federal\ndirection. Despite acknowledging that there is “ambiguity\nas to what constitutes cooperation,” the Court says that\n“no coherent understanding of the term would incorporate\nthe unilateral decision of state officers to arrest an alien\nfor being removable absent any request, approval, or other\ninstruction from the Federal Government.” Ante, at 18.\nThe Court adopts an unnecessarily stunted view of coop-\neration. No one would say that a state or local officer\nhas failed to cooperate by making an on-the-spot arrest to\nenforce federal law. Unsolicited aid is not necessarily\nuncooperative.\n  To be sure, were an officer to persist in making an ar-\nrest that the officer knows is unwanted, such conduct\nwould not count as cooperation. But nothing in the rele-\nvant federal statutes suggests that Congress does not\nwant aliens who have committed removable offenses to be\narrested.2 To the contrary, §1226(c)(1) commands that the\nExecutive “shall take into custody any alien” who is de-\nportable for having committed a specified offense. And\n§1226(c)(2) substantially limits the circumstances under\nwhich the Executive has discretion to release aliens held\nin custody under paragraph (1). So if an officer arrests an\nalien who is removable for having committed one of the\ncrimes listed in §1226(c)(1), the Federal Government is\n——————\n  2 That goes for the Executive Branch as well, which has made the\n\napprehension and removal of criminal aliens a priority. See App. 108.\n18              ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nobligated to take the alien into custody.\n  That Congress generally requires the Executive to take\ncustody of criminal aliens casts considerable doubt on the\nCourt’s concern that §6 is an obstacle to the Federal Gov-\nernment’s exercise of discretion. The Court claims that\nthe authority conferred by §6 “could be exercised without\nany input from the Federal Government about whether\nan arrest is warranted in a particular case” and that this\n“would allow the State to achieve its own immigration\npolicy,” resulting in the “unnecessary harassment of some\naliens . . . whom federal officials determine should not be\nremoved.” Ante, at 17. But §1226(c)(1) belies the Court’s\nfear. In many, if not most, cases involving aliens who are\nremovable for having committed criminal offenses, Con-\ngress has left the Executive no discretion but to take the\nalien into custody. State and local officers do not frus-\ntrate the removal process by arresting criminal aliens.\nThe Executive retains complete discretion over whether\nthose aliens are ultimately removed. And once the Fed-\neral Government makes a determination that a particular\ncriminal alien will not be removed, then Arizona officers\nare presumably no longer authorized under §6 to arrest\nthe alien.\n  To be sure, not all offenses for which officers have au-\nthority to arrest under §6 are covered by §1226(c)(1). As\nfor aliens who have committed those offenses, Congress\nhas given the Executive discretion under §1226(a) over\nwhether to arrest and detain them pending a decision on\nremoval. But the mere fact that the Executive has en-\nforcement discretion cannot mean that the exercise of\nstate police powers in support of federal law is automati-\ncally pre-empted. If that were true, then state and local\nofficers could never make arrests to enforce any federal\nstatute because the Executive always has at least some\ngeneral discretion over the enforcement of federal law as a\npractical matter. But even assuming that the express\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

Instead, it only\ngrants state and local officers permission to make such\narrests. The trouble with this premature, facial challenge\nis that it affords Arizona no opportunity to implement\nits law in a way that would avoid any potential conflicts\nwith federal law. For example, Arizona could promulgate\nguidelines or regulations limiting the arrest authority\nconferred by §6 to the crimes specified in §1226(c)(1). And\nto the extent §1226(c)(1) is unclear about which exact\ncrimes are covered,3 Arizona could go even further and\nidentify specific crimes for which there is no doubt an\nalien would be removable. The point is that there are\nplenty of permissible applications of §6, and the Court\nshould not invalidate the statute at this point without at\nleast some indication that Arizona has implemented it in a\nmanner at odds with Congress’ clear and manifest intent.\nWe have said that a facial challenge to a statute is “the\nmost difficult challenge to mount successfully” because “the\nchallenger must establish that no set of circumstances\nexists under which the [statute] would be valid.” United\nStates v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nheavy burden.\n                               B\n   Finally, the Court tells us that §6 conflicts with federal\nlaw because it provides state and local officers with “even\ngreater authority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible\nremovability than Congress has given to trained federal\nimmigration officers.” Ante, at 16–17. The Court points to\n8 U. S. C. §1357(a)(2), which empowers “authorized” offi-\ncers and employees of ICE to make arrests without a fed-\neral warrant if “the alien so arrested is in the United States\nin violation of any [immigration] law or regulation and is\nlikely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his\narrest.” Because §6 would allow Arizona officers to make\narrests “regardless of whether a federal warrant has\nissued or the alien is likely to escape,” ante, at 17, the\nCourt concludes that §6 is an obstacle to the accomplish-\nment of Congress’ objectives. But §6 is an obstacle only to\nthe extent it conflicts with Congress’ clear and manifest\nintent to preclude state and local officers from making\narrests except where a federal warrant has issued or the\narrestee is likely to escape. By granting warrantless\narrest authority to federal officers, Congress has not mani-\nfested an unmistakable intent to strip state and local\nofficers of their warrantless arrest authority under state\nlaw.\n   Likewise, limitations on federal arrest authority do not\nmean that the arrest authority of state and local officers\nmust be similarly limited. Our opinion in Miller, 357 U. S.\n301, is instructive. In that case, a District of Columbia\nofficer, accompanied by a federal officer, made an arrest\nbased on a suspected federal narcotics offense. Id., at\n303–304. The federal officer did not have statutory au-\nthorization to arrest without a warrant, but the local\nofficer did. Id., at 305. We held that District of Columbia\nlaw dictated the lawfulness of the arrest. Id., at 305–306.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          21\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nWhere a state or local officer makes a warrantless arrest\nto enforce federal law, we said that “the lawfulness of the\narrest without warrant is to be determined by reference to\nstate law.” Id., at 305. Under §6, an Arizona officer may\nbe authorized to make an arrest that a federal officer may\nnot be authorized to make under §1357(a)(2). As Miller\nmakes clear, that fact alone does not render arrests by\nstate or local officers pursuant to §6 unlawful. Nor does it\nmanifest a clear congressional intent to displace the exer-\ncise of state police powers that are brought to bear in aid\nof federal law.\n</pre>", "id": 802971, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/06/25/arizona_v._united_states.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 11–182.      Argued April 25, 2012—Decided June 25, 2012\nAn Arizona statute known as S. B. 1070 was enacted in 2010 to address\n pressing issues related to the large number of unlawful aliens in the\n State. The United States sought to enjoin the law as preempted. The\n District Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing four of its\n provisions from taking effect. Section 3 makes failure to comply with\n federal alien-registration requirements a state misdemeanor; §5(C)\n makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien to seek or engage\n in work in the State; §6 authorizes state and local officers to arrest\n without a warrant a person “the officer has probable cause to believe\n . . . has committed any public offense that makes the person remova-\n ble from the United States”; and §2(B) requires officers conducting a\n stop, detention, or arrest to make efforts, in some circumstances, to\n verify the person’s immigration status with the Federal Government.\n The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the United States had es-\n tablished a likelihood of success on its preemption claims.\nHeld:\n    1. The Federal Government’s broad, undoubted power over immi-\n gration and alien status rests, in part, on its constitutional power to\n “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and on\n its inherent sovereign power to control and conduct foreign relations,\n see Toll v. Moreno, 458 U. S. 1, 10. Federal governance is extensive\n and complex. Among other things, federal law specifies categories of\n aliens who are ineligible to be admitted to the United States, 8\n U. S. C. §1182; requires aliens to register with the Federal Govern-\n ment and to carry proof of status, §§1304(e), 1306(a); imposes sanc-\n tions on employers who hire unauthorized workers, §1324a; and spec-\n ifies which aliens may be removed and the procedures for doing so,\n see §1227. Removal is a civil matter, and one of its principal features\n2                      ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials, who must\n    decide whether to pursue removal at all. Immigration and Customs\n    Enforcement (ICE), an agency within the Department of Homeland\n    Security, is responsible for identifying, apprehending, and removing\n    illegal aliens. It also operates the Law Enforcement Support Center,\n    which provides immigration status information to federal, state, and\n    local officials around the clock. Pp. 2–7.\n       2. The Supremacy Clause gives Congress the power to preempt\n    state law. A statute may contain an express preemption provision,\n    see, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of United States of America v. Whit-\n    ing, 563 U. S. ___, ___, but state law must also give way to federal\n    law in at least two other circumstances. First, States are precluded\n    from regulating conduct in a field that Congress has determined\n    must be regulated by its exclusive governance. See Gade v. National\n    Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 115. Intent can be in-\n    ferred from a framework of regulation “so pervasive . . . that Con-\n    gress left no room for the States to supplement it” or where a “federal\n    interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to\n    preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.” Rice v. San-\n    ta Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230. Second, state laws are\n    preempted when they conflict with federal law, including when they\n    stand “as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\n    purposes and objectives of Congress.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S.\n    52, 67. Pp. 7–8.\n       3. Sections 3, 5(C), and 6 of S. B. 1070 are preempted by federal\n    law. Pp. 8–19.\n          (a) Section 3 intrudes on the field of alien registration, a field in\n    which Congress has left no room for States to regulate. In Hines, a\n    state alien-registration program was struck down on the ground that\n    Congress intended its “complete” federal registration plan to be a\n    “single integrated and all-embracing system.” 312 U. S., at 74. That\n    scheme did not allow the States to “curtail or complement” federal\n    law or “enforce additional or auxiliary regulations.” Id., at 66–67.\n    The federal registration framework remains comprehensive. Because\n    Congress has occupied the field, even complementary state regulation\n    is impermissible. Pp. 8–11.\n          (b) Section 5(C)’s criminal penalty stands as an obstacle to the\n    federal regulatory system. The Immigration Reform and Control Act\n    of 1986 (IRCA), a comprehensive framework for “combating the em-\n    ployment of illegal aliens,” Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v.\n    NLRB, 535 U. S. 137, 147, makes it illegal for employers to knowing-\n    ly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ unauthorized workers, 8\n    U. S. C. §§1324a(a)(1)(A), (a)(2), and requires employers to verify pro-\n    spective       employees’      employment        authorization      status,\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n§§1324a(a)(1)(B), (b). It imposes criminal and civil penalties on em-\nployers, §§1324a(e)(4), (f), but only civil penalties on aliens who seek,\nor engage in, unauthorized employment, e.g., §§1255(c)(2), (c)(8).\nIRCA’s express preemption provision, though silent about whether\nadditional penalties may be imposed against employees, “does not bar\nthe ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles” or impose a\n“special burden” making it more difficult to establish the preemption\nof laws falling outside the clause. Geier v. American Honda Motor\nCo., 529 U. S. 861, 869–872. The correct instruction to draw from the\ntext, structure, and history of IRCA is that Congress decided it would\nbe inappropriate to impose criminal penalties on unauthorized em-\nployees. It follows that a state law to the contrary is an obstacle to\nthe regulatory system Congress chose. Pp. 12–15.\n      (c) By authorizing state and local officers to make warrantless\narrests of certain aliens suspected of being removable, §6 too creates\nan obstacle to federal law. As a general rule, it is not a crime for a\nremovable alien to remain in the United States. The federal scheme\ninstructs when it is appropriate to arrest an alien during the removal\nprocess. The Attorney General in some circumstances will issue a\nwarrant for trained federal immigration officers to execute. If no fed-\neral warrant has been issued, these officers have more limited au-\nthority. They may arrest an alien for being “in the United States in\nviolation of any [immigration] law or regulation,” for example, but on-\nly where the alien “is likely to escape before a warrant can be ob-\ntained.” §1357(a)(2). Section 6 attempts to provide state officers with\neven greater arrest authority, which they could exercise with no in-\nstruction from the Federal Government. This is not the system Con-\ngress created. Federal law specifies limited circumstances in which\nstate officers may perform an immigration officer’s functions. This\nincludes instances where the Attorney General has granted that au-\nthority in a formal agreement with a state or local government. See,\ne.g., §1357(g)(1). Although federal law permits state officers to “coop-\nerate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension,\ndetention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United\nStates,” §1357(g)(10)(B), this does not encompass the unilateral deci-\nsion to detain authorized by §6. Pp. 15–19.\n   4. It was improper to enjoin §2(B) before the state courts had an\nopportunity to construe it and without some showing that §2(B)’s en-\nforcement in fact conflicts with federal immigration law and its objec-\ntives. Pp. 19–24.\n      (a) The state provision has three limitations: A detainee is pre-\nsumed not to be an illegal alien if he or she provides a valid Arizona\ndriver’s license or similar identification; officers may not consider\nrace, color, or national origin “except to the extent permitted by the\n4                      ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    United States [and] Arizona Constitution[s]”; and §2(B) must be “im-\n    plemented in a manner consistent with federal law regulating immi-\n    gration, protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting the\n    privileges and immunities of United States citizens.” P. 20.\n         (b) This Court finds unpersuasive the argument that, even with\n    those limits, §2(B) must be held preempted at this stage. Pp. 20–24.\n           (1) The mandatory nature of the status checks does not inter-\n    fere with the federal immigration scheme. Consultation between fed-\n    eral and state officials is an important feature of the immigration\n    system. In fact, Congress has encouraged the sharing of information\n    about possible immigration violations. See §§1357(g)(10)(A), 1373(c).\n    The federal scheme thus leaves room for a policy requiring state offi-\n    cials to contact ICE as a routine matter. Cf. Whiting, 563 U. S., at\n    ___. Pp. 20–21.\n           (2) It is not clear at this stage and on this record that §2(B), in\n    practice, will require state officers to delay the release of detainees\n    for no reason other than to verify their immigration status. This\n    would raise constitutional concerns. And it would disrupt the federal\n    framework to put state officers in the position of holding aliens in\n    custody for possible unlawful presence without federal direction and\n    supervision. But §2(B) could be read to avoid these concerns. If the\n    law only requires state officers to conduct a status check during the\n    course of an authorized, lawful detention or after a detainee has been\n    released, the provision would likely survive preemption—at least ab-\n    sent some showing that it has other consequences that are adverse to\n    federal law and its objectives. Without the benefit of a definitive in-\n    terpretation from the state courts, it would be inappropriate to as-\n    sume §2(B) will be construed in a way that conflicts with federal law.\n    Cf. Fox v. Washington, 236 U. S. 273, 277. This opinion does not\n    foreclose other preemption and constitutional challenges to the law\n    as interpreted and applied after it goes into effect.

The law is often referred to as\nS. B. 1070, the version introduced in the state senate. See\nalso H. 2162 (2010) (amending S. 1070). Its stated pur­\npose is to “discourage and deter the unlawful entry and\npresence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlaw­\nfully present in the United States.” Note following Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051 (West 2012). The law’s provi­\nsions establish an official state policy of “attrition through\nenforcement.” Ibid. The question before the Court is\nwhether federal law preempts and renders invalid four\nseparate provisions of the state law.\n                             I\n  The United States filed this suit against Arizona, seek­\ning to enjoin S. B. 1070 as preempted. Four provisions of\nthe law are at issue here. Two create new state offenses.\nSection 3 makes failure to comply with federal alien­\nregistration requirements a state misdemeanor. Ariz.\n2                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. §13–1509 (West Supp. 2011). Section 5, in\nrelevant part, makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthor­\nized alien to seek or engage in work in the State; this\nprovision is referred to as §5(C). See §13–2928(C). Two\nother provisions give specific arrest authority and inves-\ntigative duties with respect to certain aliens to state and\nlocal law enforcement officers. Section 6 authorizes offic­\ners to arrest without a warrant a person “the officer has\nprobable cause to believe . . . has committed any public\noffense that makes the person removable from the United\nStates.” §13–3883(A)(5). Section 2(B) provides that offic­\ners who conduct a stop, detention, or arrest must in some\ncircumstances make efforts to verify the person’s immi­\ngration status with the Federal Government. See §11–\n1051(B) (West 2012).\n   The United States District Court for the District of\nArizona issued a preliminary injunction preventing the\nfour provisions at issue from taking effect. 703 F. Supp.\n2d 980, 1008 (2010). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed. 641 F. 3d 339, 366 (2011). It agreed that\nthe United States had established a likelihood of success\non its preemption claims. The Court of Appeals was unan­\nimous in its conclusion that §§3 and 5(C) were likely\npreempted. Judge Bea dissented from the decision to\nuphold the preliminary injunction against §§2(B) and 6.\nThis Court granted certiorari to resolve important ques­\ntions concerning the interaction of state and federal power\nwith respect to the law of immigration and alien status.\n565 U.

This\nauthority rests, in part, on the National Government’s\nconstitutional power to “establish an uniform Rule of Nat-\nuralization,” U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and its inher-\nent power as sovereign to control and conduct relations\nwith foreign nations, see Toll, supra, at 10 (citing United\nStates v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 318\n(1936)).\n   The federal power to determine immigration policy is\nwell settled. Immigration policy can affect trade, invest­\nment, tourism, and diplomatic relations for the entire\nNation, as well as the perceptions and expectations of\naliens in this country who seek the full protection of its\nlaws. See, e.g., Brief for Argentina et al. as Amici Curiae;\nsee also Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U. S. 580,\n588–589 (1952). Perceived mistreatment of aliens in the\nUnited States may lead to harmful reciprocal treatment\nof American citizens abroad. See Brief for Madeleine K.\nAlbright et al. as Amici Curiae 24–30.\n   It is fundamental that foreign countries concerned about\nthe status, safety, and security of their nationals in the\nUnited States must be able to confer and communicate on\nthis subject with one national sovereign, not the 50 sepa­\nrate States. See Chy Lung v. Freeman, 92 U. S. 275, 279–\n280 (1876); see also The Federalist No. 3, p. 39 (C. Rossiter\ned. 2003) (J. Jay) (observing that federal power would be\nnecessary in part because “bordering States . . . under the\nimpulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense of appar­\nent interest or injury” might take action that would un­\ndermine foreign relations). This Court has reaffirmed that\n“[o]ne of the most important and delicate of all interna­\ntional relationships . . . has to do with the protection of the\njust rights of a country’s own nationals when those na­\ntionals are in another country.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312\nU. S. 52, 64 (1941).\n   Federal governance of immigration and alien status is\n4                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nextensive and complex. Congress has specified catego­\nries of aliens who may not be admitted to the United\nStates. See 8 U. S. C. §1182. Unlawful entry and unlawful\nreentry into the country are federal offenses. §§1325,\n1326. Once here, aliens are required to register with the\nFederal Government and to carry proof of status on their\nperson. See §§1301–1306. Failure to do so is a federal\nmisdemeanor. §§1304(e), 1306(a). Federal law also au­\nthorizes States to deny noncitizens a range of public bene­\nfits, §1622; and it imposes sanctions on employers who\nhire unauthorized workers, §1324a.\n   Congress has specified which aliens may be removed\nfrom the United States and the procedures for doing so.\nAliens may be removed if they were inadmissible at the\ntime of entry, have been convicted of certain crimes, or\nmeet other criteria set by federal law. See §1227. Re­\nmoval is a civil, not criminal, matter. A principal feature of\nthe removal system is the broad discretion exercised by\nimmigration officials. See Brief for Former Commission­\ners of the United States Immigration and Naturalization\nService as Amici Curiae 8–13 (hereinafter Brief for For­\nmer INS Commissioners). Federal officials, as an initial\nmatter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue\nremoval at all. If removal proceedings commence, aliens\nmay seek asylum and other discretionary relief allowing\nthem to remain in the country or at least to leave without\nformal removal. See §1229a(c)(4); see also, e.g., §§1158\n(asylum), 1229b (cancellation of removal), 1229c (volun­\ntary departure).\n   Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law em­\nbraces immediate human concerns. Unauthorized work­\ners trying to support their families, for example, likely\npose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who com­\nmit a serious crime. The equities of an individual case\nmay turn on many factors, including whether the alien\nhas children born in the United States, long ties to the\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

Returning\nan alien to his own country may be deemed inappropriate\neven where he has committed a removable offense or fails\nto meet the criteria for admission. The foreign state may\nbe mired in civil war, complicit in political persecution, or\nenduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien\nor his family will be harmed upon return. The dynamic\nnature of relations with other countries requires the Exec­\nutive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are con­\nsistent with this Nation’s foreign policy with respect to\nthese and other realities.\n   Agencies in the Department of Homeland Security play\na major role in enforcing the country’s immigration laws.\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is re-\nsponsible for determining the admissibility of aliens and\nsecuring the country’s borders. See Dept. of Homeland\nSecurity, Office of Immigration Statistics, Immigration\nEnforcement Actions: 2010, p. 1 (2011). In 2010, CBP’s\nBorder Patrol apprehended almost half a million people.\nId., at 3. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a\nsecond agency, “conducts criminal investigations involving\nthe enforcement of immigration-related statutes.” Id., at\n2.

See App. 91. ICE officers are respon­\nsible “for the identification, apprehension, and removal of\nillegal aliens from the United States.” Immigration En­\nforcement Actions, supra, at 2. Hundreds of thousands of\naliens are removed by the Federal Government every year.\nSee id., at 4 (reporting there were 387,242 removals, and\n476,405 returns without a removal order, in 2010).\n6               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n  The pervasiveness of federal regulation does not di­\nminish the importance of immigration policy to the States.\nArizona bears many of the consequences of unlawful im­\nmigration. Hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens\nare apprehended in Arizona each year. Dept. of Homeland\nSecurity, Office of Immigration Statistics, 2010 Yearbook\nof Immigration Statistics 93 (2011) (Table 35). Unauthor­\nized aliens who remain in the State comprise, by one es-\ntimate, almost six percent of the population. See Passel\n& Cohn, Pew Hispanic Center, U. S. Unauthorized Im-\nmigration Flows Are Down Sharply Since Mid-Decade 3\n(2010). And in the State’s most populous county, these\naliens are reported to be responsible for a disproportionate\nshare of serious crime. See, e.g., Camarota & Vaughan,\nCenter for Immigration Studies, Immigration and Crime:\nAssessing a Conflicted Situation 16 (2009) (Table 3) (esti­\nmating that unauthorized aliens comprise 8.9% of the\npopulation and are responsible for 21.8% of the felonies in\nMaricopa County, which includes Phoenix).\n  Statistics alone do not capture the full extent of Arizo­\nna’s concerns. Accounts in the record suggest there is an\n“epidemic of crime, safety risks, serious property damage,\nand environmental problems” associated with the influx\nof illegal migration across private land near the Mexican\nborder.

S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nanalysis that follows. The issue is whether, under pre­\nemption principles, federal law permits Arizona to imple­\nment the state-law provisions in dispute.\n                             III\n  Federalism, central to the constitutional design, adopts\nthe principle that both the National and State Govern­\nments have elements of sovereignty the other is bound to\nrespect. See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457\n(1991); U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779,\n838 (1995) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). From the existence\nof two sovereigns follows the possibility that laws can be\nin conflict or at cross-purposes. The Supremacy Clause\nprovides a clear rule that federal law “shall be the su­\npreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State\nshall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or\nLaws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”\nArt. VI, cl. 2. Under this principle, Congress has the\npower to preempt state law. See Crosby v. National For-\neign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372 (2000); Gibbons\nv. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210–211 (1824). There is no doubt\nthat Congress may withdraw specified powers from the\nStates by enacting a statute containing an express\npreemption provision. See, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of\nUnited States of America v. Whiting, 563 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 4).\n  State law must also give way to federal law in at least\ntwo other circumstances. First, the States are precluded\nfrom regulating conduct in a field that Congress, acting\nwithin its proper authority, has determined must be regu­\nlated by its exclusive governance. See Gade v. National\nSolid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 115 (1992).\nThe intent to displace state law altogether can be inferred\nfrom a framework of regulation “so pervasive . . . that\nCongress left no room for the States to supplement it” or\nwhere there is a “federal interest . . . so dominant that the\n8                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of\nstate laws on the same subject.” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator\nCorp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947); see English v. General\nElec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 79 (1990).\n   Second, state laws are preempted when they conflict\nwith federal law. Crosby, supra, at 372. This includes\ncases where “compliance with both federal and state\nregulations is a physical impossibility,” Florida Lime &\nAvocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142–143\n(1963), and those instances where the challenged state law\n“stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu­\ntion of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,”\nHines, 312 U. S., at 67; see also Crosby, supra, at 373\n(“What is a sufficient obstacle is a matter of judgment, to\nbe informed by examining the federal statute as a whole\nand identifying its purpose and intended effects”). In\npreemption analysis, courts should assume that “the\nhistoric police powers of the States” are not superseded\n“unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Con­\ngress.” Rice, supra, at 230; see Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.\n555, 565 (2009).\n   The four challenged provisions of the state law each\nmust be examined under these preemption principles.\n                              IV\n                               A\n                         Section 3\n   Section 3 of S. B. 1070 creates a new state misde-\nmeanor. It forbids the “willful failure to complete or carry an\nalien registration document . . . in violation of 8 United\nStates Code section 1304(e) or 1306(a).” Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §11–1509(A) (West Supp. 2011). In effect, §3 adds a\nstate-law penalty for conduct proscribed by federal law.\nThe United States contends that this state enforcement\nmechanism intrudes on the field of alien registration, a\nfield in which Congress has left no room for States to\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nregulate. See Brief for United States 27, 31.\n   The Court discussed federal alien-registration require­\nments in Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52. In 1940, as\ninternational conflict spread, Congress added to federal\nimmigration law a “complete system for alien registra­\ntion.” Id., at 70. The new federal law struck a careful\nbalance. It punished an alien’s willful failure to register\nbut did not require aliens to carry identification cards.\nThere were also limits on the sharing of registration rec­\nords and fingerprints. The Court found that Congress\nintended the federal plan for registration to be a “single\nintegrated and all-embracing system.” Id., at 74. Because\nthis “complete scheme . . . for the registration of aliens”\ntouched on foreign relations, it did not allow the States to\n“curtail or complement” federal law or to “enforce addi­\ntional or auxiliary regulations.” Id., at 66–67. As a con­\nsequence, the Court ruled that Pennsylvania could not\nenforce its own alien-registration program. See id., at 59, 74.\n   The present regime of federal regulation is not identi­\ncal to the statutory framework considered in Hines, but\nit remains comprehensive. Federal law now includes a\nrequirement that aliens carry proof of registration. 8\nU. S. C. §1304(e). Other aspects, however, have stayed the\nsame. Aliens who remain in the country for more than 30\ndays must apply for registration and be fingerprinted.\nCompare §1302(a) with id., §452(a) (1940 ed.). Detailed\ninformation is required, and any change of address has\nto be reported to the Federal Government. Compare\n§§1304(a), 1305(a) (2006 ed.), with id., §§455(a), 456 (1940\ned.). The statute continues to provide penalties for the\nwillful failure to register. Compare §1306(a) (2006 ed.),\nwith id., §457 (1940 ed.).\n   The framework enacted by Congress leads to the conclu­\nsion here, as it did in Hines, that the Federal Government\nhas occupied the field of alien registration. See American\nIns. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 419, n. 11 (2003)\n10               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(characterizing Hines as a field preemption case); Pennsyl-\nvania v. Nelson, 350 U. S. 497, 504 (1956) (same); see also\nDinh, Reassessing the Law of Preemption, 88 Geo. L. J.\n2085, 2098–2099, 2107 (2000) (same). The federal statu­\ntory directives provide a full set of standards governing\nalien registration, including the punishment for noncom­\npliance. It was designed as a “ ‘harmonious whole.’ ”\nHines, supra, at 72. Where Congress occupies an entire\nfield, as it has in the field of alien registration, even com­\nplementary state regulation is impermissible. Field pre­\nemption reflects a congressional decision to foreclose any\nstate regulation in the area, even if it is parallel to fed-\neral standards. See Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464\nU. S. 238, 249 (1984).\n   Federal law makes a single sovereign responsible for\nmaintaining a comprehensive and unified system to keep\ntrack of aliens within the Nation’s borders. If §3 of the\nArizona statute were valid, every State could give itself\nindependent authority to prosecute federal registration\nviolations, “diminish[ing] the [Federal Government]’s control\nover enforcement” and “detract[ing] from the ‘integrated\nscheme of regulation’ created by Congress.” Wisconsin\nDept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 288–289\n(1986). Even if a State may make violation of federal\nlaw a crime in some instances, it cannot do so in a field\n(like the field of alien registration) that has been occupied\nby federal law. See California v. Zook, 336 U. S. 725, 730–\n731, 733 (1949); see also In re Loney, 134 U. S. 372, 375–\n376 (1890) (States may not impose their own punishment\nfor perjury in federal courts).\n   Arizona contends that §3 can survive preemption be­\ncause the provision has the same aim as federal law and\nadopts its substantive standards. This argument not only\nignores the basic premise of field preemption—that States\nmay not enter, in any respect, an area the Federal Gov­\nernment has reserved for itself—but also is unpersuasive\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non its own terms. Permitting the State to impose its own\npenalties for the federal offenses here would conflict with\nthe careful framework Congress adopted. Cf. Buckman\nCo. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341, 347–348\n(2001) (States may not impose their own punishment for\nfraud on the Food and Drug Administration); Wisconsin\nDept., supra, at 288 (States may not impose their own\npunishment for repeat violations of the National Labor\nRelations Act). Were §3 to come into force, the State\nwould have the power to bring criminal charges against\nindividuals for violating a federal law even in circum­\nstances where federal officials in charge of the comprehen­\nsive scheme determine that prosecution would frustrate\nfederal policies.\n   There is a further intrusion upon the federal scheme.\nEven where federal authorities believe prosecution is ap-\npropriate, there is an inconsistency between §3 and fed-\neral law with respect to penalties. Under federal law,\nthe failure to carry registration papers is a misdemeanor\nthat may be punished by a fine, imprisonment, or a term\nof probation. See 8 U. S. C. §1304(e) (2006 ed.); 18 U. S. C.\n§3561. State law, by contrast, rules out probation as a\npossible sentence (and also eliminates the possibility of\na pardon). See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–1509(D) (West\nSupp. 2011). This state framework of sanctions creates a\nconflict with the plan Congress put in place. See Wiscon-\nsin Dept., supra, at 286 (“[C]onflict is imminent whenever\ntwo separate remedies are brought to bear on the same\nactivity” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   These specific conflicts between state and federal law\nsimply underscore the reason for field preemption. As it\ndid in Hines, the Court now concludes that, with respect\nto the subject of alien registration, Congress intended to\npreclude States from “complement[ing] the federal law, or\nenforc[ing] additional or auxiliary regulations.” 312 U. S.,\nat 66–67. Section 3 is preempted by federal law.\n12              ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                                B\n                         Section 5(C)\n   Unlike §3, which replicates federal statutory require­\nments, §5(C) enacts a state criminal prohibition where no\nfederal counterpart exists. The provision makes it a state\nmisdemeanor for “an unauthorized alien to knowingly ap-\nply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform\nwork as an employee or independent contractor” in Ari­\nzona. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–2928(C) (West Supp. 2011).\nViolations can be punished by a $2,500 fine and incarcera­\ntion for up to six months. See §13–2928(F); see also\n§§13–707(A)(1) (West 2010); 13–802(A); 13–902(A)(5). The\nUnited States contends that the provision upsets the bal-\nance struck by the Immigration Reform and Control Act\nof 1986 (IRCA) and must be preempted as an obstacle\nto the federal plan of regulation and control.\n   When there was no comprehensive federal program\nregulating the employment of unauthorized aliens, this\nCourt found that a State had authority to pass its own\nlaws on the subject. In 1971, for example, California\npassed a law imposing civil penalties on the employment\nof aliens who were “not entitled to lawful residence in the\nUnited States if such employment would have an adverse\neffect on lawful resident workers.” 1971 Cal. Stats. ch.\n1442, §1(a). The law was upheld against a preemption\nchallenge in De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351 (1976). De\nCanas recognized that “States possess broad authority\nunder their police powers to regulate the employment\nrelationship to protect workers within the State.” Id., at\n356. At that point, however, the Federal Government had\nexpressed no more than “a peripheral concern with [the]\nemployment of illegal entrants.” Id., at 360; see Whiting,\n563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).\n   Current federal law is substantially different from the\nregime that prevailed when De Canas was decided. Con­\ngress enacted IRCA as a comprehensive framework for\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“combating the employment of illegal aliens.” Hoffman\nPlastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U. S. 137, 147\n(2002). The law makes it illegal for employers to know­\ningly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ unauthorized\nworkers. See 8 U. S. C. §§1324a(a)(1)(A), (a)(2). It also\nrequires every employer to verify the employment authori­\nzation status of prospective employees. See §§1324a(a)\n(1)(B), (b); 8 CFR §274a.2(b) (2012). These requirements\nare enforced through criminal penalties and an escalat­\ning series of civil penalties tied to the number of times\nan employer has violated the provisions. See 8 U. S. C.\n§§1324a(e)(4), (f); 8 CFR §274a.10.\n  This comprehensive framework does not impose federal\ncriminal sanctions on the employee side (i.e., penalties on\naliens who seek or engage in unauthorized work). Under\nfederal law some civil penalties are imposed instead. With\ncertain exceptions, aliens who accept unlawful employ­\nment are not eligible to have their status adjusted to\nthat of a lawful permanent resident. See 8 U. S. C.\n§§1255(c)(2), (c)(8). Aliens also may be removed from the\ncountry for having engaged in unauthorized work. See\n§1227(a)(1)(C)(i); 8 CFR §214.1(e). In addition to specify­\ning these civil consequences, federal law makes it a crime\nfor unauthorized workers to obtain employment through\nfraudulent means. See 18 U. S. C. §1546(b). Congress has\nmade clear, however, that any information employees\nsubmit to indicate their work status “may not be used” for\npurposes other than prosecution under specified federal\ncriminal statutes for fraud, perjury, and related conduct.\nSee 8 U. S. C. §§1324a(b)(5), (d)(2)(F)–(G).\n  The legislative background of IRCA underscores the fact\nthat Congress made a deliberate choice not to impose crim­\n\ninal penalties on aliens who seek, or engage in, unauthor­\nized employment. A commission established by Congress\nto study immigration policy and to make recommen­\ndations concluded these penalties would be “unnecessary\n14              ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand unworkable.” U. S. Immigration Policy and the Na­\ntional Interest: The Final Report and Recommendations of\nthe Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy\nwith Supplemental Views by Commissioners 65–66 (1981);\nsee Pub. L. 95–412, §4, 92 Stat. 907. Proposals to make\nunauthorized work a criminal offense were debated and\ndiscussed during the long process of drafting IRCA. See\nBrief for Service Employees International Union et al. as\nAmici Curiae 9–12. But Congress rejected them. See, e.g.,\n119 Cong. Rec. 14184 (1973) (statement of Rep. Dennis).\nIn the end, IRCA’s framework reflects a considered judg­\nment that making criminals out of aliens engaged in\nunauthorized work—aliens who already face the possibil­\nity of employer exploitation because of their removable\nstatus—would be inconsistent with federal policy and ob-\njectives. See, e.g., Hearings before the Subcommittee\nNo. 1 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 92d Cong.,\n1st Sess., pt. 3, pp. 919–920 (1971) (statement of Rep.\nRodino, the eventual sponsor of IRCA in the House of\nRepresentatives).\n   IRCA’s express preemption provision, which in most\ninstances bars States from imposing penalties on employ­\ners of unauthorized aliens, is silent about whether addi­\ntional penalties may be imposed against the employees\nthemselves. See 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2); Whiting, supra,\nat ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2). But the existence of an “ex­\npress pre-emption provisio[n] does not bar the ordinary\nworking of conflict pre-emption principles” or impose a\n“special burden” that would make it more difficult to\nestablish the preemption of laws falling outside the clause.\nGeier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 869–\n872 (2000); see Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51,\n65 (2002).\n   The ordinary principles of preemption include the well­\nsettled proposition that a state law is preempted where it\n“stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and exe­\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.”\nHines, 312 U. S., at 67. Under §5(C) of S. B. 1070, Arizona\nlaw would interfere with the careful balance struck by\nCongress with respect to unauthorized employment of\naliens. Although §5(C) attempts to achieve one of the\nsame goals as federal law—the deterrence of unlawful\nemployment—it involves a conflict in the method of en­\nforcement. The Court has recognized that a “[c]onflict\nin technique can be fully as disruptive to the system Con­\ngress enacted as conflict in overt policy.” Motor Coach\nEmployees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 287 (1971). The\ncorrect instruction to draw from the text, structure, and\nhistory of IRCA is that Congress decided it would be inap­\npropriate to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek\nor engage in unauthorized employment. It follows that a\nstate law to the contrary is an obstacle to the regulatory\nsystem Congress chose. See Puerto Rico Dept. of Con-\nsumer Affairs v. ISLA Petroleum Corp., 485 U. S. 495, 503\n(1988) (“Where a comprehensive federal scheme intention­\nally leaves a portion of the regulated field without con­\ntrols, then the pre-emptive inference can be drawn—not\nfrom federal inaction alone, but from inaction joined with\naction”). Section 5(C) is preempted by federal law.\n                              C\n                          Section 6\n  Section 6 of S. B. 1070 provides that a state officer,\n“without a warrant, may arrest a person if the officer has\nprobable cause to believe . . . [the person] has committed\nany public offense that makes [him] removable from the\nUnited States.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–3883(A)(5)\n(West Supp. 2011). The United States argues that arrests\nauthorized by this statute would be an obstacle to the\nremoval system Congress created.\n  As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien\nto remain present in the United States. See INS v. Lopez-\n16               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMendoza, 468 U. S. 1032, 1038 (1984). If the police stop\nsomeone based on nothing more than possible removabil­\nity, the usual predicate for an arrest is absent. When an\nalien is suspected of being removable, a federal official\nissues an administrative document called a Notice to Ap­\npear. See 8 U. S. C. §1229(a); 8 CFR §239.1(a) (2012).\nThe form does not authorize an arrest. Instead, it gives\nthe alien information about the proceedings, including the\ntime and date of the removal hearing. See 8 U. S. C.\n§1229(a)(1). If an alien fails to appear, an in absentia\norder may direct removal. §1229a(5)(A).\n   The federal statutory structure instructs when it is ap­\npropriate to arrest an alien during the removal process.\nFor example, the Attorney General can exercise discretion\nto issue a warrant for an alien’s arrest and detention\n“pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed\nfrom the United States.” 8 U. S. C. §1226(a); see Memo­\nrandum from John Morton, Director, ICE, to All Field\nOffice Directors et al., Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion\nConsistent with the Civil Immigration Enforcement Prior­\nities of the Agency for the Apprehension, Detention, and\nRemoval of Aliens (June 17, 2011) (hereinafter 2011 ICE\nMemorandum) (describing factors informing this and re­\nlated decisions). And if an alien is ordered removed after\na hearing, the Attorney General will issue a warrant.\nSee 8 CFR §241.2(a)(1). In both instances, the warrants\nare executed by federal officers who have received training\nin the enforcement of immigration law. See §§241.2(b),\n287.5(e)(3). If no federal warrant has been issued, those\nofficers have more limited authority. See 8 U. S. C. §1357(a).\nThey may arrest an alien for being “in the United\nStates in violation of any [immigration] law or regula-\ntion,” for example, but only where the alien “is likely to\nescape before a warrant can be obtained.” §1357(a)(2).\n   Section 6 attempts to provide state officers even greater\nauthority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible remova­\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbility than Congress has given to trained federal immi-\ngration officers. Under state law, officers who believe\nan alien is removable by reason of some “public offense”\nwould have the power to conduct an arrest on that basis\nregardless of whether a federal warrant has issued or\nthe alien is likely to escape. This state authority could be\nexercised without any input from the Federal Government\nabout whether an arrest is warranted in a particular case.\nThis would allow the State to achieve its own immigra­\ntion policy. The result could be unnecessary harassment\nof some aliens (for instance, a veteran, college student, or\nsomeone assisting with a criminal investigation) whom\nfederal officials determine should not be removed.\n   This is not the system Congress created. Federal law\nspecifies limited circumstances in which state officers may\nperform the functions of an immigration officer. A princi­\npal example is when the Attorney General has granted\nthat authority to specific officers in a formal agreement\nwith a state or local government. See §1357(g)(1); see also\n§1103(a)(10) (authority may be extended in the event of an\n“imminent mass influx of aliens off the coast of the United\nStates”); §1252c (authority to arrest in specific circum­\nstance after consultation with the Federal Government);\n§1324(c) (authority to arrest for bringing in and harboring\ncertain aliens). Officers covered by these agreements are\nsubject to the Attorney General’s direction and super­\nvision. §1357(g)(3). There are significant complexities\ninvolved in enforcing federal immigration law, including\nthe determination whether a person is removable. See\nPadilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2010) (ALITO,\nJ., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 4–7). As a result,\nthe agreements reached with the Attorney General must\ncontain written certification that officers have received\nadequate training to carry out the duties of an immigra­\ntion officer. See §1357(g)(2); cf. 8 CFR §§287.5(c) (ar-\nrest power contingent on training), 287.1(g) (defining the\n18               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntraining).\n    By authorizing state officers to decide whether an\nalien should be detained for being removable, §6 violates\nthe principle that the removal process is entrusted to the\ndiscretion of the Federal Government. See, e.g., Reno v.\nAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471,\n483–484 (1999); see also Brief for Former INS Commis­\nsioners 8–13. A decision on removability requires a de­\ntermination whether it is appropriate to allow a foreign\nnational to continue living in the United States. Decisions\nof this nature touch on foreign relations and must be made\nwith one voice. See Jama v. Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 348 (2005) (“Removal deci­\nsions, including the selection of a removed alien’s destina­\ntion, may implicate [the Nation’s] relations with foreign\npowers and require consideration of changing political and\neconomic circumstances” (internal quotation marks omit­\nted)); see also Galvan v. Press, 347 U. S. 522, 531 (1954)\n(“Policies pertaining to the entry of aliens and their right\nto remain here are . . . entrusted exclusively to Congress\n. . .”); Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33, 42 (1915) (“The author­\nity to control immigration—to admit or exclude aliens—is\nvested solely in the Federal Government”).\n    In defense of §6, Arizona notes a federal statute permit­\nting state officers to “cooperate with the Attorney General\nin the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal\nof aliens not lawfully present in the United States.” 8\nU. S. C. §1357(g)(10)(B). There may be some ambiguity as\nto what constitutes cooperation under the federal law; but\nno coherent understanding of the term would incorporate\nthe unilateral decision of state officers to arrest an alien\nfor being removable absent any request, approval, or other\ninstruction from the Federal Government. The Depart­\nment of Homeland Security gives examples of what would\nconstitute cooperation under federal law. These include\nsituations where States participate in a joint task force\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith federal officers, provide operational support in exe­\ncuting a warrant, or allow federal immigration officials\nto gain access to detainees held in state facilities. See\nDept. of Homeland Security, Guidance on State and Local\nGovernments’ Assistance in Immigration Enforcement\nand Related Matters 13–14 (2011), online at http://\nwww.dhs.gov/files/resources/immigration.shtm (all Inter­\nnet materials as visited June 21, 2012, and available in\nClerk of Court’s case file). State officials can also assist\nthe Federal Government by responding to requests for\ninformation about when an alien will be released from\ntheir custody. See §1357(d). But the unilateral state\naction to detain authorized by §6 goes far beyond these\nmeasures, defeating any need for real cooperation.\n   Congress has put in place a system in which state offic­\ners may not make warrantless arrests of aliens based on\npossible removability except in specific, limited circum­\nstances. By nonetheless authorizing state and local offi-\ncers to engage in these enforcement activities as a general\nmatter, §6 creates an obstacle to the full purposes and\nobjectives of Congress. See Hines, 312 U. S., at 67. Sec­\ntion 6 is preempted by federal law.\n                             D\n                        Section 2(B)\n  Section 2(B) of S. B. 1070 requires state officers to make\na “reasonable attempt . . . to determine the immigration\nstatus” of any person they stop, detain, or arrest on some\nother legitimate basis if “reasonable suspicion exists that\nthe person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the\nUnited States.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(B) (West\n2012). The law also provides that “[a]ny person who is\narrested shall have the person’s immigration status de­\ntermined before the person is released.” Ibid. The accepted\nway to perform these status checks is to contact ICE,\nwhich maintains a database of immigration records.\n20               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Three limits are built into the state provision. First, a\ndetainee is presumed not to be an alien unlawfully present\nin the United States if he or she provides a valid Arizona\ndriver’s license or similar identification. Second, officers\n“may not consider race, color or national origin . . . except\nto the extent permitted by the United States [and] Ari­\nzona Constitution[s].” Ibid. Third, the provisions must\nbe “implemented in a manner consistent with federal law\nregulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all\npersons and respecting the privileges and immunities of\nUnited States citizens.” §11–1051(L) (West 2012).\n  The United States and its amici contend that, even with\nthese limits, the State’s verification requirements pose an\nobstacle to the framework Congress put in place. The first\nconcern is the mandatory nature of the status checks. The\nsecond is the possibility of prolonged detention while the\nchecks are being performed.\n                               1\n  Consultation between federal and state officials is an\nimportant feature of the immigration system. Congress\nhas made clear that no formal agreement or special train­\ning needs to be in place for state officers to “communicate\nwith the [Federal Government] regarding the immigration\nstatus of any individual, including reporting knowledge\nthat a particular alien is not lawfully present in the United\nStates.” 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10)(A). And Congress has\nobligated ICE to respond to any request made by state\nofficials for verification of a person’s citizenship or im-\nmigration status. See §1373(c); see also §1226(d)(1)(A)\n(requiring a system for determining whether individuals\narrested for aggravated felonies are aliens). ICE’s Law\nEnforcement Support Center operates “24 hours a day,\nseven days a week, 365 days a year” and provides, among\nother things, “immigration status, identity information\nand real-time assistance to local, state and federal law\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nenforcement agencies.” ICE, Fact Sheet: Law Enforce­\nment Support Center (May 29, 2012), online at http://\nwww.ice.gov/news/library/factsheets/lesc.htm.     LESC re­\n\nsponded to more than one million requests for information\nin 2009 alone. App. 93.\n   The United States argues that making status verifica­\ntion mandatory interferes with the federal immigration\nscheme. It is true that §2(B) does not allow state officers\nto consider federal enforcement priorities in deciding\nwhether to contact ICE about someone they have de­\ntained. See Brief for United States 47–50. In other words,\nthe officers must make an inquiry even in cases where it\nseems unlikely that the Attorney General would have\nthe alien removed. This might be the case, for example,\nwhen an alien is an elderly veteran with significant and\nlongstanding ties to the community. See 2011 ICE Memo­\nrandum 4–5 (mentioning these factors as relevant).\n   Congress has done nothing to suggest it is inappropriate\nto communicate with ICE in these situations, however.\nIndeed, it has encouraged the sharing of information about\npossible immigration violations. See 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)\n(10)(A). A federal statute regulating the public benefits\nprovided to qualified aliens in fact instructs that “no State\nor local government entity may be prohibited, or in any\nway restricted, from sending to or receiving from [ICE]\ninformation regarding the immigration status, lawful or\nunlawful, of an alien in the United States.” §1644. The\nfederal scheme thus leaves room for a policy requiring\nstate officials to contact ICE as a routine matter. Cf.\nWhiting, 563 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 23–24) (reject­\ning argument that federal law preempted Arizona’s re­\nquirement that employers determine whether employees\nwere eligible to work through the federal E-Verify system\nwhere the Federal Government had encouraged its use).\n22               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               2\n   Some who support the challenge to §2(B) argue that, in\npractice, state officers will be required to delay the release\nof some detainees for no reason other than to verify their\nimmigration status. See, e.g., Brief for Former Arizona\nAttorney General Terry Goddard et al. as Amici Curiae 37,\nn. 49. Detaining individuals solely to verify their immi­\ngration status would raise constitutional concerns. See,\ne.g., Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U. S. 323, 333 (2009); Illinois\nv. Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407 (2005) (“A seizure that is\njustified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket\nto the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond\nthe time reasonably required to complete that mission”).\nAnd it would disrupt the federal framework to put state\nofficers in the position of holding aliens in custody for\npossible unlawful presence without federal direction and\nsupervision. Cf. Part IV–C, supra (concluding that Ari­\nzona may not authorize warrantless arrests on the basis of\nremovability). The program put in place by Congress does\nnot allow state or local officers to adopt this enforcement\nmechanism.\n   But §2(B) could be read to avoid these concerns. To take\none example, a person might be stopped for jaywalking in\nTucson and be unable to produce identification. The first\nsentence of §2(B) instructs officers to make a “reasonable”\nattempt to verify his immigration status with ICE if there\nis reasonable suspicion that his presence in the United\nStates is unlawful. The state courts may conclude that,\nunless the person continues to be suspected of some crime\nfor which he may be detained by state officers, it would\nnot be reasonable to prolong the stop for the immigration\ninquiry. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 12, n. 4 (“[Section\n2(B)] does not require the verification be completed during\nthe stop or detention if that is not reasonable or practica­\nble”); cf. Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 101 (2005) (finding\nno Fourth Amendment violation where questioning about\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nimmigration status did not prolong a stop).\n   To take another example, a person might be held pend­\ning release on a charge of driving under the influence of\nalcohol. As this goes beyond a mere stop, the arrestee\n(unlike the jaywalker) would appear to be subject to the\ncategorical requirement in the second sentence of §2(B)\nthat “[a]ny person who is arrested shall have the person’s\nimmigration status determined before [he] is released.”\nState courts may read this as an instruction to initiate a\nstatus check every time someone is arrested, or in some\nsubset of those cases, rather than as a command to hold\nthe person until the check is complete no matter the cir­\ncumstances. Even if the law is read as an instruction to\ncomplete a check while the person is in custody, moreover,\nit is not clear at this stage and on this record that the\nverification process would result in prolonged detention.\n   However the law is interpreted, if §2(B) only requires\nstate officers to conduct a status check during the course\nof an authorized, lawful detention or after a detainee has\nbeen released, the provision likely would survive pre-\nemption—at least absent some showing that it has other\nconsequences that are adverse to federal law and its objec­\ntives. There is no need in this case to address whether\nreasonable suspicion of illegal entry or another immigra­\ntion crime would be a legitimate basis for prolonging a\ndetention, or whether this too would be preempted by\nfederal law. See, e.g., United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S.\n581, 589 (1948) (authority of state officers to make arrests\nfor federal crimes is, absent federal statutory instruction,\na matter of state law); Gonzales v. Peoria, 722 F. 2d 468,\n475–476 (CA9 1983) (concluding that Arizona officers have\nauthority to enforce the criminal provisions of federal\nimmigration law), overruled on other grounds in Hodgers-\nDurgin v. de la Vina, 199 F. 3d 1037 (CA9 1999).\n   The nature and timing of this case counsel caution in\nevaluating the validity of §2(B). The Federal Government\n24               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhas brought suit against a sovereign State to challenge the\nprovision even before the law has gone into effect. There\nis a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how\nit will be enforced. At this stage, without the benefit of a\ndefinitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be\ninappropriate to assume §2(B) will be construed in a way\nthat creates a conflict with federal law. Cf. Fox v. Wash-\nington, 236 U. S. 273, 277 (1915) (“So far as statutes fairly\nmay be construed in such a way as to avoid doubtful con­\nstitutional questions they should be so construed; and it is\nto be presumed that state laws will be construed in that\nway by the state courts” (citation omitted)). As a result,\nthe United States cannot prevail in its current challenge.\nSee Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S. 440,\n446 (1960) (“To hold otherwise would be to ignore the\nteaching of this Court’s decisions which enjoin seeking out\nconflicts between state and federal regulation where none\nclearly exists”). This opinion does not foreclose other\npreemption and constitutional challenges to the law as\ninterpreted and applied after it goes into effect.\n                             V\n  Immigration policy shapes the destiny of the Nation.\nOn May 24, 2012, at one of this Nation’s most distin­\nguished museums of history, a dozen immigrants stood\nbefore the tattered flag that inspired Francis Scott Key\nto write the National Anthem.

La Plata River & Cherry Creek\nDitch Co., 304 U. S. 92, 104 (1938). Today’s opinion, ap­\nproving virtually all of the Ninth Circuit’s injunction\nagainst enforcement of the four challenged provisions of\nArizona’s law, deprives States of what most would con-\nsider the defining characteristic of sovereignty: the power\nto exclude from the sovereign’s territory people who have\nno right to be there. Neither the Constitution itself nor\neven any law passed by Congress supports this result. I\ndissent.\n                            I\n  As a sovereign, Arizona has the inherent power to ex­\nclude persons from its territory, subject only to those\nlimitations expressed in the Constitution or constitution­\nally imposed by Congress. That power to exclude has long\nbeen recognized as inherent in sovereignty. Emer de\nVattel’s seminal 1758 treatise on the Law of Nations\nstated:\n    “The sovereign may forbid the entrance of his territory\n    either to foreigners in general, or in particular cases,\n    or to certain persons, or for certain particular pur-\n    poses, according as he may think it advantageous to\n2                   ARIZONA v.

There is nothing in all this, that does not\n      flow from the rights of domain and sovereignty: every\n      one is obliged to pay respect to the prohibition; and\n      whoever dares violate it, incurs the penalty decreed\n      to render it effectual.” The Law of Nations, bk. II,\n      ch. VII, §94, p. 309 (B. Kapossy & R. Whatmore eds.\n      2008).\nSee also I R. Phillimore, Commentaries upon Internation­\nal Law, pt. III, ch. X, p. 233 (1854) (“It is a received maxim\nof International Law that, the Government of a State may\nprohibit the entrance of strangers into the country”).1\n   There is no doubt that “before the adoption of the consti­\ntution of the United States” each State had the author-\nity to “prevent [itself] from being burdened by an influx of\npersons.” Mayor of New York v. Miln, 11 Pet. 102, 132–\n133 (1837). And the Constitution did not strip the States\nof that authority. To the contrary, two of the Constitu­\ntion’s provisions were designed to enable the States to\nprevent “the intrusion of obnoxious aliens through other\nStates.” Letter from James Madison to Edmund Randolph\n(Aug. 27, 1782), in 1 The Writings of James Madison 226\n(1900); accord, The Federalist No. 42, pp. 269–271 (C.\nRossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). The Articles of Confeder­\n——————\n    1 Many of the 17th-, 18th-, and 19th-century commentators main­\ntained that states should exclude foreigners only for good reason.\nPufendorf, for example, maintained that states are generally expected\nto grant “permanent settlement to strangers who have been driven\nfrom their former home,” though acknowledging that, when faced with\nthe prospect of mass immigration, “every state may decide after its own\ncustom what privilege should be granted in such a situation.” 2 Of the\nLaw of Nature and Nations, bk.

See generally Cleveland, Powers Inherent in\nSovereignty: Indians, Aliens, Territories, and the Nineteenth Century\nOrigins of Plenary Power over Foreign Affairs, 81 Tex. L. Rev. 1, 83–87\n(2002). But the authority to exclude was universally accepted as\ninherent in sovereignty, whatever prudential limitations there might be\non its exercise.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

IV. This meant that an unwelcome\nalien could obtain all the rights of a citizen of one State\nsimply by first becoming an inhabitant of another. To\nremedy this, the Constitution’s Privileges and Immunities\nClause provided that “[t]he Citizens of each State shall be\nentitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the\nseveral States.” Art. IV, §2, cl. 1 (emphasis added). But\nif one State had particularly lax citizenship standards, it\nmight still serve as a gateway for the entry of “obnoxious\naliens” into other States. This problem was solved “by\nauthorizing the general government to establish a uniform\nrule of naturalization throughout the United States.” The\nFederalist No. 42, supra, at 271; see Art. I, §8, cl. 4. In\nother words, the naturalization power was given to Con­\ngress not to abrogate States’ power to exclude those they\ndid not want, but to vindicate it.\n   Two other provisions of the Constitution are an ac­\nknowledgment of the States’ sovereign interest in protect­\ning their borders. Article I provides that “[n]o State shall,\nwithout the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or\nDuties on Imports or Exports, except what may be abso­\nlutely necessary for executing it’s inspection Laws.” Art. I,\n§10, cl. 2 (emphasis added). This assumed what everyone\nassumed: that the States could exclude from their territory\ndangerous or unwholesome goods. A later portion of the\nsame section provides that “[n]o State shall, without the\nConsent of Congress, . . . engage in War, unless actually\ninvaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of\ndelay.” Art. I, §10, cl. 3 (emphasis added). This limits the\nStates’ sovereignty (in a way not relevant here) but leaves\nintact their inherent power to protect their territory.\n   Notwithstanding “[t]he myth of an era of unrestricted\n4                    ARIZONA v.

Neuman, The Lost Century\nof American Immigration (1776–1875), 93 Colum. L. Rev.\n1833, 1835, 1841–1880 (1993). State laws not only pro­\nvided for the removal of unwanted immigrants but also\nimposed penalties on unlawfully present aliens and those\nwho aided their immigration.2 Id., at 1883.\n   In fact, the controversy surrounding the Alien and\nSedition Acts involved a debate over whether, under the\nConstitution, the States had exclusive authority to enact\nsuch immigration laws. Criticism of the Sedition Act has\nbecome a prominent feature of our First Amendment\njurisprudence, see, e.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,\n376 U. S. 254, 273–276 (1964), but one of the Alien Acts3\nalso aroused controversy at the time:\n     “Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa­\n     tives of the United States of America in Congress as­\n     sembled, That it shall be lawful for the President of\n     the United States at any time during the continuance\n     of this act, to order all such aliens as he shall judge\n     dangerous to the peace and safety of the United\n     States, or shall have reasonable grounds to suspect\n     are concerned in any treasonable or secret machina­\n     tions against the government thereof, to depart out of\n     the territory of the United States . . . .” An Act con­\n     cerning Aliens, 1 Stat. 570, 570–571.\n\n——————\n  2 E.g., Va.

Miln, this Court considered\na New York statute that required the commander of any\nship arriving in New York from abroad to disclose “the\nname, place of birth, and last legal settlement, age and\noccupation . . . of all passengers . . . with the intention of\nproceeding to the said city.” 11 Pet., at 130–131. After\ndiscussing the sovereign authority to regulate the en­\ntrance of foreigners described by De Vattel, the Court said:\n       “The power . . . of New York to pass this law having\n    undeniably existed at the formation of the constitu­\n    tion, the simply inquiry is, whether by that instru­\n    ment it was taken from the states, and granted to\n    congress; for if it were not, it yet remains with them.”\n    Id., at 132.\n6                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nAnd the Court held that it remains. Id., at 139.\n                              II\n   One would conclude from the foregoing that after the\nadoption of the Constitution there was some doubt about\nthe power of the Federal Government to control immigra­\ntion, but no doubt about the power of the States to do so.\nSince the founding era (though not immediately), doubt\nabout the Federal Government’s power has disappeared.\nIndeed, primary responsibility for immigration policy has\nshifted from the States to the Federal Government. Con­\ngress exercised its power “[t]o establish an uniform Rule of\nNaturalization,” Art. I, §8, cl. 4, very early on, see An Act\nto establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, 1 Stat.\n103. But with the fleeting exception of the Alien Act,\nCongress did not enact any legislation regulating immi­\ngration for the better part of a century. In 1862, Congress\npassed “An Act to prohibit the ‘Coolie Trade’ by American\nCitizens in American Vessels,” which prohibited “procur­\ning [Chinese nationals] . . . to be disposed of, or sold, or\ntransferred, for any term of years or for any time what­\never, as servants or apprentices, or to be held to service or\nlabor.” 12 Stat. 340. Then, in 1875, Congress amended\nthat act to bar admission to Chinese, Japanese, and other\nAsian immigrants who had “entered into a contract or\nagreement for a term of service within the United States,\nfor lewd and immoral purposes.” An act supplementary to\nthe acts in relation to immigration, ch. 141, 18 Stat. 477.\nAnd in 1882, Congress enacted the first general immi­\ngration statute. See An act to regulate Immigration, 22\nStat. 214. Of course, it hardly bears mention that Federal\nimmigration law is now extensive.\n   I accept that as a valid exercise of federal power—not\nbecause of the Naturalization Clause (it has no necessary\nconnection to citizenship) but because it is an inherent\nattribute of sovereignty no less for the United States than\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nfor the States. As this Court has said, it is an “ ‘accepted\nmaxim of international law, that every sovereign nation\nhas the power, as inherent in sovereignty, and essential to\nself-preservation, to forbid the entrance of foreigners\nwithin its dominions.’ ” Fong Yue Ting v. United States,\n149 U. S. 698, 705 (1893) (quoting Ekiu v. United States,\n142 U. S. 651, 659 (1892)). That is why there was no need\nto set forth control of immigration as one of the enumer­\nated powers of Congress, although an acknowledgment of\nthat power (as well as of the States’ similar power, subject\nto federal abridgment) was contained in Art. I, §9, which\nprovided that “[t]he Migration or Importation of such\nPersons as any of the States now existing shall think\nproper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress\nprior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and\neight . . . .”\n   In light of the predominance of federal immigration\nrestrictions in modern times, it is easy to lose sight of the\nStates’ traditional role in regulating immigration—and to\noverlook their sovereign prerogative to do so. I accept as a\ngiven that State regulation is excluded by the Constitution\nwhen (1) it has been prohibited by a valid federal law, or\n(2) it conflicts with federal regulation—when, for example,\nit admits those whom federal regulation would exclude, or\nexcludes those whom federal regulation would admit.\n   Possibility (1) need not be considered here: there is no\nfederal law prohibiting the States’ sovereign power to ex-\nclude (assuming federal authority to enact such a law).\nThe mere existence of federal action in the immigration\narea—and the so-called field preemption arising from that\naction, upon which the Court’s opinion so heavily relies,\nante, at 9–11—cannot be regarded as such a prohibition.\nWe are not talking here about a federal law prohibiting\nthe States from regulating bubble-gum advertising, or\neven the construction of nuclear plants. We are talking\nabout a federal law going to the core of state sovereignty:\n8                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe power to exclude. Like elimination of the States’ other\ninherent sovereign power, immunity from suit, elimina-\ntion of the States’ sovereign power to exclude requires that\n“Congress . . . unequivocally expres[s] its intent to abro­\ngate,” Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 55\n(1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nImplicit “field preemption” will not do.\n   Nor can federal power over illegal immigration be\ndeemed exclusive because of what the Court’s opinion\nsolicitously calls “foreign countries[ ’] concern[s] about the\nstatus, safety, and security of their nationals in the United\nStates,” ante, at 3. The Constitution gives all those on our\nshores the protections of the Bill of Rights—but just as\nthose rights are not expanded for foreign nationals be­\ncause of their countries’ views (some countries, for exam­\nple, have recently discovered the death penalty to be\nbarbaric), neither are the fundamental sovereign powers\nof the States abridged to accommodate foreign countries’\nviews. Even in its international relations, the Federal\nGovernment must live with the inconvenient fact that it is\na Union of independent States, who have their own sover­\neign powers. This is not the first time it has found that a\nnuisance and a bother in the conduct of foreign policy.\nFour years ago, for example, the Government importuned\nus to interfere with thoroughly constitutional state judicial\nprocedures in the criminal trial of foreign nationals be­\ncause the international community, and even an opinion of\nthe International Court of Justice, disapproved them. See\nMedellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. 491 (2008). We rejected that\nrequest, as we should reject the Executive’s invocation of\nforeign-affairs considerations here. Though it may upset\nforeign powers—and even when the Federal Government\ndesperately wants to avoid upsetting foreign powers—the\nStates have the right to protect their borders against\nforeign nationals, just as they have the right to execute\nforeign nationals for murder.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n  What this case comes down to, then, is whether the\nArizona law conflicts with federal immigration law—\nwhether it excludes those whom federal law would admit,\nor admits those whom federal law would exclude. It does\nnot purport to do so. It applies only to aliens who neither\npossess a privilege to be present under federal law nor\nhave been removed pursuant to the Federal Government’s\ninherent authority. I proceed to consider the challenged\nprovisions in detail.\n                            §2(B)\n    “For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by a\n    law enforcement official . . . in the enforcement of any\n    other law or ordinance of a county, city or town or this\n    state where reasonable suspicion exists that the per­\n    son is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United\n    States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when\n    practicable, to determine the immigration status of\n    the person, except if the determination may hinder or\n    obstruct an investigation. Any person who is arrested\n    shall have the person’s immigration status deter­\n    mined before the person is released. . . .” S. B. 1070,\n    §2(B), as amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(B)\n    (West 2012).\n  The Government has conceded that “even before Section\n2 was enacted, state and local officers had state-law au­\nthority to inquire of DHS [the Department of Homeland\nSecurity] about a suspect’s unlawful status and other-\nwise cooperate with federal immigration officers.” Brief for\nUnited States 47 (citing App. 62, 82); see also Brief for\nUnited States 48–49. That concession, in my view, ob-\nviates the need for further inquiry. The Government’s\nconflict-pre-emption claim calls on us “to determine\nwhether, under the circumstances of this particular case,\n[the State’s] law stands as an obstacle to the accomplish­\nment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of\n10               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nCongress.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)\n(emphasis added). It is impossible to make such a finding\nwithout a factual record concerning the manner in which\nArizona is implementing these provisions—something the\nGovernment’s pre-enforcement challenge has pretermitted.\n“The fact that [a law] might operate unconstitutionally\nunder some conceivable set of circumstances is insuf-\nficient to render it wholly invalid, since we have not\nrecognized an ‘overbreadth’ doctrine outside the limited\ncontext of the First Amendment.” United States v. Sal­\nerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). And on its face, §2(B)\nmerely tells state officials that they are authorized to do\nsomething that they were, by the Government’s con­\ncession, already authorized to do.\n    The Court therefore properly rejects the Government’s\nchallenge, recognizing that, “[a]t this stage, without the\nbenefit of a definitive interpretation from the state courts,\nit would be inappropriate to assume §2B will be construed\nin a way that creates a conflict with federal law.” Ante, at\n23. Before reaching that conclusion, however, the Court\ngoes to great length to assuage fears that “state officers\nwill be required to delay the release of some detainees for\nno reason other than to verify their immigration status.”\nAnte, at 22. Of course, any investigatory detention, in­\ncluding one under §2(B), may become an “unreasonable\n. . . seizur[e],” U. S. Const., Amdt. IV, if it lasts too long.\nSee Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407 (2005). But\nthat has nothing to do with this case, in which the Gov­\nernment claims that §2(B) is pre-empted by federal immi­\ngration law, not that anyone’s Fourth Amendment rights\nhave been violated. And I know of no reason why a\nprotracted detention that does not violate the Fourth\nAmendment would contradict or conflict with any federal\nimmigration law.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n                              §6\n    “A peace officer, without a warrant, may arrest a per­\n    son if the officer has probable cause to believe . . .\n    [t]he person to be arrested has committed any public\n    offense that makes the person removable from the\n    United States.” S. B. 1070, §6(A)(5), Ariz. Rev. Stat.\n    Ann. §13–3883(A)(5) (West Supp. 2011).\n  This provision of S. B. 1070 expands the statutory list of\noffenses for which an Arizona police officer may make an\narrest without a warrant. See §13–3883. If an officer has\nprobable cause to believe that an individual is “removable”\nby reason of a public offense, then a warrant is not re­\nquired to make an arrest. The Government’s primary\ncontention is that §6 is pre-empted by federal immigration\nlaw because it allows state officials to make arrests “with­\nout regard to federal priorities.” Brief for United States\n53. The Court’s opinion focuses on limits that Congress\nhas placed on federal officials’ authority to arrest remov­\nable aliens and the possibility that state officials will\nmake arrests “to achieve [Arizona’s] own immigration policy”\nand “without any input from the Federal Government.”\nAnte, at 17.\n  Of course on this pre-enforcement record there is no\nreason to assume that Arizona officials will ignore federal\nimmigration policy (unless it be the questionable policy of\nnot wanting to identify illegal aliens who have committed\noffenses that make them removable). As Arizona points\nout, federal law expressly provides that state officers may\n“cooperate with the Attorney General in the identification,\napprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully\npresent in the United States,” 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10)(B);\nand “cooperation” requires neither identical efforts nor\nprior federal approval. It is consistent with the Arizona\nstatute, and with the “cooperat[ive]” system that Congress\nhas created, for state officials to arrest a removable alien,\n12               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ncontact federal immigration authorities, and follow their\nlead on what to do next. And it is an assault on logic to\nsay that identifying a removable alien and holding him for\nfederal determination of whether he should be removed\n“violates the principle that the removal process is entrusted\nto the discretion of the Federal Government,” ante, at\n18. The State’s detention does not represent commence­\nment of the removal process unless the Federal Govern­\nment makes it so.\n   But that is not the most important point. The most\nimportant point is that, as we have discussed, Arizona is\nentitled to have “its own immigration policy”—including a\nmore rigorous enforcement policy—so long as that does not\nconflict with federal law. The Court says, as though the\npoint is utterly dispositive, that “it is not a crime for a\nremovable alien to remain present in the United States,”\nante, at 15. It is not a federal crime, to be sure. But there\nis no reason Arizona cannot make it a state crime for a\nremovable alien (or any illegal alien, for that matter) to\nremain present in Arizona.\n   The Court quotes 8 U. S. C. §1226(a), which provides\nthat, “[o]n a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an\nalien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on\nwhether the alien is to be removed from the United\nStates.” Section 1357(a)(2) also provides that a federal\nimmigration official “shall have power without warrant . . .\nto arrest any alien in the United States, if he has reason to\nbelieve that the alien so arrested is in the United States in\nviolation of any [federal immigration] law or regulation\nand is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for\nhis arrest.” But statutory limitations upon the actions of\nfederal officers in enforcing the United States’ power to\nprotect its borders do not on their face apply to the actions\nof state officers in enforcing the State’s power to protect its\nborders. There is no more reason to read these provisions\nas implying that state officials are subject to similar limi­\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ntations than there is to read them as implying that only\nfederal officials may arrest removable aliens. And in any\nevent neither implication would constitute the sort of clear\nelimination of the States’ sovereign power that our cases\ndemand.\n   The Court raises concerns about “unnecessary harass­\nment of some aliens . . . whom federal officials determine\nshould not be removed.” Ante, at 17. But we have no\nlicense to assume, without any support in the record, that\nArizona officials would use their arrest authority under §6\nto harass anyone. And it makes no difference that federal\nofficials might “determine [that some unlawfully present\naliens] should not be removed,” ibid. They may well de­\ntermine not to remove from the United States aliens who\nhave no right to be here; but unless and until these aliens\nhave been given the right to remain, Arizona is entitled to\narrest them and at least bring them to federal officials’\nattention, which is all that §6 necessarily entails. (In my\nview, the State can go further than this, and punish them\nfor their unlawful entry and presence in Arizona.)\n   The Government complains that state officials might not\nheed “federal priorities.” Indeed they might not, particu­\nlarly if those priorities include willful blindness or delib-\nerate inattention to the presence of removable aliens in\nArizona. The State’s whole complaint—the reason this\nlaw was passed and this case has arisen—is that the\ncitizens of Arizona believe federal priorities are too lax.\nThe State has the sovereign power to protect its borders\nmore rigorously if it wishes, absent any valid federal\nprohibition. The Executive’s policy choice of lax federal\nenforcement does not constitute such a prohibition.\n                              §3\n    “In addition to any violation of federal law, a person is\n    guilty of willful failure to complete or carry an alien\n    registration document if the person is in violation of 8\n14               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n     [U. S. C.] §1304(e) or §1306(a).” S. B. 1070, §3(A), as\n     amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–1509(A).\n   It is beyond question that a State may make violation of\nfederal law a violation of state law as well. We have held\nthat to be so even when the interest protected is a distinc­\ntively federal interest, such as protection of the dignity of\nthe national flag, see Halter v. Nebraska, 205 U. S. 34\n(1907), or protection of the Federal Government’s ability\nto recruit soldiers, Gilbert v. Minnesota, 254 U. S. 325\n(1920). “[T]he State is not inhibited from making the national\npurposes its own purposes to the extent of exerting its\npolice power to prevent its own citizens from obstructing\nthe accomplishment of such purposes.” Id., at 331 (inter­\nnal quotation marks omitted). Much more is that so when,\nas here, the State is protecting its own interest, the integ­\nrity of its borders. And we have said that explicitly with\nregard to illegal immigration: “Despite the exclusive fed­\neral control of this Nation’s borders, we cannot conclude\nthat the States are without any power to deter the influx\nof persons entering the United States against federal law,\nand whose numbers might have a discernible impact on\ntraditional state concerns.” Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202,\n228, n. 23 (1982).\n   The Court’s opinion relies upon Hines v. Davidowitz,\nsupra. Ante, at 9–10. But that case did not, as the Court\nbelieves, establish a “field preemption” that implicitly\neliminates the States’ sovereign power to exclude those\nwhom federal law excludes. It held that the States are not\npermitted to establish “additional or auxiliary” registra­\ntion requirements for aliens. 312 U. S., at 66–67. But §3\ndoes not establish additional or auxiliary registration\nrequirements. It merely makes a violation of state law the\nvery same failure to register and failure to carry evidence\nof registration that are violations of federal law. Hines\ndoes not prevent the State from relying on the federal\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nregistration system as “an available aid in the enforce­\nment of a number of statutes of the state applicable to\naliens whose constitutional validity has not been ques­\ntioned.” Id., at 75–76 (Stone, J., dissenting). One such\nstatute is Arizona’s law forbidding illegal aliens to collect\nunemployment benefits, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–781(B)\n(West 2012). To enforce that and other laws that validly\nturn on alien status, Arizona has, in Justice Stone’s words,\nan interest in knowing “the number and whereabouts of\naliens within the state” and in having “a means of their\nidentification,” 312 U. S., at 75. And it can punish the\naliens’ failure to comply with the provisions of federal law\nthat make that knowledge and identification possible.\n   In some areas of uniquely federal concern—e.g., fraud in\na federal administrative process (Buckman Co. v. Plain­\ntiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341 (2001)) or perjury in\nviolation of a federally required oath (In re Loney, 134\nU. S. 372 (1890))—this Court has held that a State has no\nlegitimate interest in enforcing a federal scheme. But the\nfederal alien registration system is certainly not of uniquely\nfederal interest. States, private entities, and individuals\nrely on the federal registration system (including the\nE-Verify program) on a regular basis. Arizona’s legitimate in­\nterest in protecting (among other things) its unemployment­\nbenefits system is an entirely adequate basis for making\nthe violation of federal registration and carry require­\nments a violation of state law as well.\n   The Court points out, however, ante, at 11, that in some\nrespects the state law exceeds the punishments prescribed\nby federal law: It rules out probation and pardon, which\nare available under federal law. The answer is that it\nmakes no difference. Illegal immigrants who violate §3\nviolate Arizona law. It is one thing to say that the Su­\npremacy Clause prevents Arizona law from excluding\nthose whom federal law admits. It is quite something else\nto say that a violation of Arizona law cannot be punished\n16               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nmore severely than a violation of federal law. Especially\nwhere (as here) the State is defending its own sovereign\ninterests, there is no precedent for such a limitation. The\nsale of illegal drugs, for example, ordinarily violates state\nlaw as well as federal law, and no one thinks that the\nstate penalties cannot exceed the federal. As I have dis­\ncussed, moreover, “field preemption” cannot establish a\nprohibition of additional state penalties in the area of\nimmigration.\n  Finally, the Government also suggests that §3 poses an\nobstacle to the administration of federal immigration law,\nsee Brief for United States 31–33, but “there is no conflict\nin terms, and no possibility of such conflict, [if] the state\nstatute makes federal law its own,” California v. Zook, 336\nU. S. 725, 735 (1949).\n  It holds no fear for me, as it does for the Court, that\n“[w]ere §3 to come into force, the State would have the\npower to bring criminal charges against individuals for\nviolating a federal law even in circumstances where fed-\neral officials in charge of the comprehensive scheme de­\ntermine that prosecution would frustrate federal policies.”\nAnte, at 11. That seems to me entirely appropriate when\nthe State uses the federal law (as it must) as the criterion\nfor the exercise of its own power, and the implementation\nof its own policies of excluding those who do not belong\nthere. What I do fear—and what Arizona and the States\nthat support it fear—is that “federal policies” of nonen­\nforcement will leave the States helpless before those evil\neffects of illegal immigration that the Court’s opinion\ndutifully recites in its prologue (ante, at 6) but leaves\nunremedied in its disposition.\n                            §5(C)\n     “It is unlawful for a person who is unlawfully present\n     in the United States and who is an unauthorized alien\n     to knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n    place or perform work as an employee or independent\n    contractor in this state.” S. B. 1070, §5(C), as amended,\n    Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–2928(C).\n   Here, the Court rightly starts with De Canas v. Bica,\n424 U. S. 351 (1976), which involved a California law\nproviding that “ ‘[n]o employer shall knowingly employ an\nalien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the United\nStates if such employment would have an adverse effect\non lawful resident workers.’ ” Id., at 352 (quoting Califor­\nnia Labor Code Ann. §2805(a)). This Court concluded that\nthe California law was not pre-empted, as Congress had\nneither occupied the field of “regulation of employment of\nillegal aliens” nor expressed “the clear and manifest pur­\npose” of displacing such state regulation. Id., at 356–357\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, at the time\nDe Canas was decided, §5(C) would have been indubitably\nlawful.\n   The only relevant change is that Congress has since\nenacted its own restrictions on employers who hire illegal\naliens, 8 U. S. C. §1324a, in legislation that also includes\nsome civil (but no criminal) penalties on illegal aliens who\naccept unlawful employment. The Court concludes from\nthis (reasonably enough) “that Congress made a deliberate\nchoice not to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek,\nor engage in, unauthorized employment,” ante, at 13. But\nthat is not the same as a deliberate choice to prohibit\nthe States from imposing criminal penalties. Congress’s\nintent with regard to exclusion of state law need not be\nguessed at, but is found in the law’s express pre-emption\nprovision, which excludes “any State or local law impos-\ning civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licens­\ning and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit\nor refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens,”\n§1324a(h)(2) (emphasis added). Common sense, reflected\nin the canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius, suggests\n18               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthat the specification of pre-emption for laws punishing\n“those who employ” implies the lack of pre-emption for\nother laws, including laws punishing “those who seek or\naccept employment.”\n  The Court has no credible response to this. It quotes\nour jurisprudence to the effect that an “express pre­\nemption provisio[n] does not bar the ordinary working of\nconflict pre-emption principles.” Ante, at 14 (quoting Geier\nv. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 869\n(2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)). True enough—\nconflict preemption principles. It then goes on say that\nsince “Congress decided it would be inappropriate to im­\npose criminal penalties on aliens who seek or engage in\nunauthorized employment,” “[i]t follows that a state law to\nthe contrary is an obstacle to the regulatory system Con­\ngress chose.” Ante, at 15. For “ ‘[w]here a comprehensive\nfederal scheme intentionally leaves a portion of the regu­\nlated field without controls, then the pre-emptive inference\ncan be drawn.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Puerto Rico Dept. of Con­\nsumer Affairs v. ISLA Petroleum Corp., 485 U.S. 495, 503\n(1988)). All that is a classic description not of conflict\npre-emption but of field pre-emption, which (concededly)\ndoes not occur beyond the terms of an express pre-emption\nprovision.\n  The Court concludes that §5(C) “would interfere with\nthe careful balance struck by Congress,” ante, at 15, (an­\nother field pre-emption notion, by the way) but that is easy\nto say and impossible to demonstrate. The Court relies\nprimarily on the fact that “[p]roposals to make unauthor­\nized work a criminal offense were debated and discussed\nduring the long process of drafting [the Immigration Re­\nform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA)],” “[b]ut Congress\nrejected them.” Ante, at 14.

Of course there is no reason why the\nFederal Executive’s need to allocate its scarce enforcement\nresources should disable Arizona from devoting its re­\nsources to illegal immigration in Arizona that in its view\nthe Federal Executive has given short shrift. Despite\nCongress’s prescription that “the immigration laws of the\nUnited States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly,”\nIRCA §115, 100 Stat. 3384, Arizona asserts without\ncontradiction and with supporting citations:\n    “[I]n the last decade federal enforcement efforts have\n    focused primarily on areas in California and Texas,\n    leaving Arizona’s border to suffer from comparative\n    neglect. The result has been the funneling of an in­\n    creasing tide of illegal border crossings into Arizona.\n    Indeed, over the past decade, over a third of the Na­\n    tion’s illegal border crossings occurred in Arizona.”\n    Brief for Petitioners 2–3 (footnote omitted).\nMust Arizona’s ability to protect its borders yield to the\nreality that Congress has provided inadequate funding for\nfederal enforcement—or, even worse, to the Executive’s\nunwise targeting of that funding?\n20                  ARIZONA v.

It has become clear that federal\nenforcement priorities—in the sense of priorities based on\nthe need to allocate “scarce enforcement resources”—is not\nthe problem here. After this case was argued and while\nit was under consideration, the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity announced a program exempting from immi-\ngration enforcement some 1.4 million illegal immigrants\nunder the age of 30.4 If an individual unlawfully present\nin the United States\n     “• came to the United States under the age of sixteen;\n     “• has continuously resided in the United States for\n        at least five years . . . ,\n     “• is currently in school, has graduated from high\n        school, has obtained a general education develop­\n        ment certificate, or is an honorably discharged\n        veteran . . . ,\n     “• has not been convicted of a [serious crime]; and\n     “• is not above the age of thirty,”5\nthen U.

The President said at a\nnews conference that the new program is “the right thing\nto do” in light of Congress’s failure to pass the Administra­\ntion’s proposed revision of the Immigration Act.7 Perhaps\nit is, though Arizona may not think so. But to say, as the\nCourt does, that Arizona contradicts federal law by enforc­\ning applications of the Immigration Act that the President\ndeclines to enforce boggles the mind.\n   The Court opinion’s looming specter of inutterable hor­\nror—“[i]f §3 of the Arizona statute were valid, every State\ncould give itself independent authority to prosecute fed-\neral registration violations,” ante, at 10—seems to me not\nso horrible and even less looming. But there has come to\npass, and is with us today, the specter that Arizona and\nthe States that support it predicted: A Federal Govern­\nment that does not want to enforce the immigration laws\nas written, and leaves the States’ borders unprotected\nagainst immigrants whom those laws would exclude. So\nthe issue is a stark one. Are the sovereign States at the\nmercy of the Federal Executive’s refusal to enforce the\nNation’s immigration laws?\n   A good way of answering that question is to ask: Would\nthe States conceivably have entered into the Union if the\nConstitution itself contained the Court’s holding? Today’s\njudgment surely fails that test. At the Constitutional\nConvention of 1787, the delegates contended with “the\njealousy of the states with regard to their sovereignty.” 1\nRecords of the Federal Convention 19 (M. Farrand ed.\n1911) (statement of Edmund Randolph).

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nguarded—as reflected in the innumerable proposals that\nnever left Independence Hall. Now, imagine a provision—\nperhaps inserted right after Art. I, §8, cl. 4, the Naturali­\nzation Clause—which included among the enumerated\npowers of Congress “To establish Limitations upon Immi­\ngration that will be exclusive and that will be enforced\nonly to the extent the President deems appropriate.” The\ndelegates to the Grand Convention would have rushed to\nthe exits.\n   As is often the case, discussion of the dry legalities that\nare the proper object of our attention suppresses the very\nhuman realities that gave rise to the suit. Arizona bears\nthe brunt of the country’s illegal immigration problem. Its\ncitizens feel themselves under siege by large numbers of\nillegal immigrants who invade their property, strain their\nsocial services, and even place their lives in jeopardy.\nFederal officials have been unable to remedy the problem,\nand indeed have recently shown that they are unwilling to\ndo so. Thousands of Arizona’s estimated 400,000 illegal\nimmigrants—including not just children but men and\nwomen under 30—are now assured immunity from en­\nforcement, and will be able to compete openly with Ari­\nzona citizens for employment.\n   Arizona has moved to protect its sovereignty—not in\ncontradiction of federal law, but in complete compliance\nwith it. The laws under challenge here do not extend or\nrevise federal immigration restrictions, but merely enforce\nthose restrictions more effectively. If securing its territory\nin this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we\nshould cease referring to it as a sovereign State. I dissent.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

B. 1070. I reach that conclusion, however, for the sim-\nple reason that there is no conflict between the “ordinary\nmeanin[g]” of the relevant federal laws and that of the\nfour provisions of Arizona law at issue here. Wyeth v.\nLevine, 555 U. S. 555, 588 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring\nin judgment) (“Pre-emption analysis should not be a free-\nwheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in\ntension with federal objectives, but an inquiry into whether\nthe ordinary meanings of state and federal law conflict”\n(brackets; internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Section 2(B) of S. B. 1070 provides that, when Arizona\nlaw enforcement officers reasonably suspect that a person\nthey have lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested is unlaw-\nfully present, “a reasonable attempt shall be made, when\npracticable, to determine the immigration status of the\nperson” pursuant to the verification procedure established\nby Congress in 8 U. S. C. §1373(c). Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§11–1051(B) (West 2012). Nothing in the text of that or\nany other federal statute prohibits Arizona from directing\nits officers to make immigration-related inquiries in these\nsituations.

S. C. §1644. And, federal\nlaw imposes an affirmative obligation on federal officials\nto respond to a State’s immigration-related inquiries.\n§1373(c).\n   Section 6 of S. B. 1070 authorizes Arizona law enforce-\nment officers to make warrantless arrests when there is\nprobable cause to believe that an arrestee has committed a\npublic offense that renders him removable under federal\nimmigration law. States, as sovereigns, have inherent\nauthority to conduct arrests for violations of federal law,\nunless and until Congress removes that authority. See\nUnited States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 589 (1948) (holding\nthat state law determines the validity of a warrantless\narrest for a violation of federal law “in the absence of\nan applicable federal statute”). Here, no federal statute\npurports to withdraw that authority. As JUSTICE SCALIA\nnotes, ante, at 12 (opinion concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part), federal law does limit the authority of federal\nofficials to arrest removable aliens, but those statutes do\nnot apply to state officers. And, federal law expressly\nrecognizes that state officers may “cooperate with the\nAttorney General” in the “apprehension” and “detention”\nof “aliens not lawfully present in the United States.”\n§1357(g)(10)(B). Nothing in that statute indicates that\nsuch cooperation requires a prior “request, approval, or\nother instruction from the Federal Government.” Ante, at\n18 (majority opinion).\n   Section 3 of S.

Section 3 simply\nincorporates federal registration standards. Unlike the\nCourt, I would not hold that Congress pre-empted the field\nof enforcing those standards. “[O]ur recent cases have\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

Here, nothing in the text of the relevant federal\nstatutes indicates that Congress intended enforcement of\nits registration requirements to be exclusively the prov-\nince of the Federal Government. That Congress created a\n“full set of standards governing alien registration,” ante, at\n10 (majority opinion), merely indicates that it intended the\nscheme to be capable of working on its own, not that it\nwanted to preclude the States from enforcing the federal\nstandards. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52 (1941), is not\nto the contrary. As JUSTICE SCALIA explains, ante, at 14,\nHines at most holds that federal law pre-empts the States\nfrom creating additional registration requirements. But\nhere, Arizona is merely seeking to enforce the very regis-\ntration requirements that Congress created.\n   Section 5(C) of S. B. 1070 prohibits unlawfully present\naliens from knowingly applying for, soliciting, or perform-\ning work in Arizona. Section 5(C) operates only on indi-\nviduals whom Congress has already declared ineligible to\nwork in the United States. Nothing in the text of the\nfederal immigration laws prohibits States from imposing\ntheir own criminal penalties on such individuals. Fed-\neral law expressly pre-empts States from “imposing civil or\ncriminal sanctions (other than through licensing and\nsimilar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer\nfor a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.” 8 U. S. C.\n§1324a(h)(2) (emphasis added). But it leaves States free\nto impose criminal sanctions on the employees themselves.\n   Despite the lack of any conflict between the ordinary\nmeaning of the Arizona law and that of the federal laws at\nissue here, the Court holds that various provisions of the\nArizona law are pre-empted because they “stan[d] as an\n4               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\npurposes and objectives of Congress.” Hines, supra, at 67.\nI have explained that the “purposes and objectives” theory\nof implied pre-emption is inconsistent with the Constitu-\ntion because it invites courts to engage in freewheeling\nspeculation about congressional purpose that roams well\nbeyond statutory text. See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 604 (opin-\nion concurring in judgment); see also Williamson v. Mazda\nMotor of America, Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (opin-\nion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2–3); Haywood v.\nDrown, 556 U.

See Wyeth, supra, at 604\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). Thus, even assum-\ning the existence of some tension between Arizona’s law\nand the supposed “purposes and objectives” of Congress, I\nwould not hold that any of the provisions of the Arizona\nlaw at issue here are pre-empted on that basis.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

B.\n1070. Section 2(B) requires Arizona law enforcement\nofficers to make a “reasonable attempt,” “when practica-\nble,” to ascertain the immigration status of any person\nwhom an officer lawfully stops, detains, or arrests “where\nreasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and\nis unlawfully present in the United States.” Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §11–1051(B) (West 2012). Section 3 provides\nthat an alien who willfully fails “to complete or carry an\nalien registration document” in violation of 8 U. S. C.\n§1304(e) or §1306(a) is guilty of a misdemeanor. Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §13–1509(A) (West Supp. 2011). Section 5(C)\nmakes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien who\nis unlawfully present in the United States “to knowingly\napply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform\nwork as an employee or independent contractor.” Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §13–2928(C). And §6 authorizes Arizona\nlaw enforcement officers to arrest without a warrant any\nperson whom the officer has probable cause to believe “has\ncommitted any public offense that makes the person re-\nmovable from the United States.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§13–3883(A)(5).\n   I agree with the Court that §2(B) is not pre-empted.\n2                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nThat provision does not authorize or require Arizona law\nenforcement officers to do anything they are not already\nallowed to do under existing federal law. The United\nStates’ argument that §2(B) is pre-empted, not by any\nfederal statute or regulation, but simply by the Executive’s\ncurrent enforcement policy is an astounding assertion of\nfederal executive power that the Court rightly rejects.\n   I also agree with the Court that §3 is pre-empted by\nvirtue of our decision in Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S.\n52 (1941). Our conclusion in that case that Congress had\nenacted an “all-embracing system” of alien registration\nand that States cannot “enforce additional or auxiliary\nregulations,” id., at 66–67, 74, forecloses Arizona’s attempt\nhere to impose additional, state-law penalties for viola-\ntions of the federal registration scheme.\n   While I agree with the Court on §2(B) and §3, I part\nways on §5(C) and §6. The Court’s holding on §5(C) is\ninconsistent with De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351 (1976),\nwhich held that employment regulation, even of aliens\nunlawfully present in the country, is an area of traditional\nstate concern. Because state police powers are implicated\nhere, our precedents require us to presume that federal\nlaw does not displace state law unless Congress’ intent to\ndo so is clear and manifest. I do not believe Congress has\nspoken with the requisite clarity to justify invalidation of\n§5(C). Nor do I believe that §6 is invalid. Like §2(B), §6\nadds virtually nothing to the authority that Arizona law\nenforcement officers already exercise. And whatever little\nauthority they have gained is consistent with federal law.\n                       Section 2(B)\n                             A\n  Although §2(B) of the Arizona law has occasioned much\ncontroversy, it adds nothing to the authority that Arizona\nlaw enforcement officers, like officers in all other States,\nalready possess under federal law. For that reason, I\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nagree with the Court that §2(B) is not pre-empted.\n   Section 2(B) quite clearly does not expand the authority\nof Arizona officers to make stops or arrests. It is triggered\nonly when a “lawful stop, detention or arrest [is] made . . .\nin the enforcement of any other [state or local] law or\nordinance.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(B) (emphasis\nadded). Section 2(B) thus comes into play only when\nan officer has reasonable suspicion or probable cause to\nbelieve that a person has committed a nonimmigration\noffense. Arizona officers plainly possessed this authority\nbefore §2(B) took effect.\n   Section 2(B) also does not expand the authority of Ari-\nzona officers to inquire about the immigration status of\npersons who are lawfully detained. When a person is\nstopped or arrested and “reasonable suspicion exists that\nthe person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the\nUnited States,” §2(B) instructs Arizona officers to make a\n“reasonable attempt,” “when practicable,” to ascertain that\nperson’s immigration status. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–\n1051(B). Even before the Arizona Legislature enacted\n§2(B), federal law permitted state and local officers to\nmake such inquiries. In 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10)(A), Con-\ngress has made clear that state and local governments\nneed not enter into formal agreements with the Federal\nGovernment in order “to communicate with the [Federal\nGovernment] regarding the immigration status of any\nindividual.” In addition, Congress has mandated that\nneither the Federal Government nor any state or local\ngovernment may “prohibit, or in any way restrict, any\ngovernment entity or official from sending to, or receiving\nfrom, [the Federal Government] information regarding the\ncitizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of\nany individual.” §1373(a); see also §1644 (providing that\n“no State or local government entity may be prohibited,\nor in any way restricted, from sending to or receiving\nfrom [the Federal Government] information regarding the\n4               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nimmigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an alien in the\nUnited States”). And while these provisions preserve the\nauthority of state and local officers to seek immigration-\nstatus information from the Federal Government, another\nfederal statute, §1373(c), requires that the Federal Gov-\nernment respond to any such inquiries “by providing the\nrequested verification or status information.” It comes\nas no surprise, therefore, that many States and localities\npermit their law enforcement officers to make the kinds of\ninquiries that §2(B) prescribes. See App. 294–298 (report-\ning that officers in 59 surveyed state and local jurisdic-\ntions “generally” ask arrestees about their immigration\nstatus while 34 do not and that officers in 78 jurisdictions\n“generally” inform Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(ICE) when they believe an arrestee to be an undocumented\nalien while only 17 do not). Congress has invited state\nand local governments to make immigration-related in-\nquiries and has even obligated the Federal Government to\nrespond. Through §2(B), Arizona has taken Congress up\non that invitation.\n   The United States does not deny that officers may, at\ntheir own discretion, inquire about the immigration status\nof persons whom they lawfully detain. Instead, the United\nStates argues that §2(B) is pre-empted because it impedes\nfederal-state cooperation by mandating that officers verify\nthe immigration status of every detained person if there is\nreason to believe that the person is unlawfully present in\nthe country. The United States claims that §2(B)’s man-\ndate runs contrary to federal law in that it “precludes\nofficers from taking [the Federal Government’s] priorities\nand discretion into account.” Brief for United States\n50. “[B]y interposing a mandatory state law between state\nand local officers and their federal counterparts,” writes\nthe United States, §2(B) “stands as an obstacle to the ac-\ncomplishment of the federal requirement of cooperation\nand the full effectuation of the enforcement judgment and\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ndiscretion Congress has vested in the Executive Branch.”\nIbid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n   The underlying premise of the United States’ argument\nseems to be that state and local officers, when left to their\nown devices, generally take federal enforcement priorities\ninto account. But there is no reason to think that this\npremise is true. And even if it were, it would not follow\nthat §2(B)’s blanket mandate is at odds with federal law.\nNothing in the relevant federal statutes requires state and\nlocal officers to consider the Federal Government’s priori-\nties before requesting verification of a person’s immigra-\ntion status. Neither 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10) nor §1373(a)\nconditions the right of state and local officers to communi-\ncate with the Federal Government on their first taking\naccount of its priorities. Nor does §1373(c) condition the\nFederal Government’s obligation to answer requests for in-\nformation on the sensitivity of state and local officers to\nits enforcement discretion. In fact, §1373(c) dictates that\nthe Federal Government “shall respond” to any inquiry\nseeking verification of immigration status, and that com-\nmand applies whether or not the requesting officer has\nbothered to consider federal priorities. Because no federal\nstatute requires such consideration, §2(B) does not conflict\nwith federal law.\n   In any event, it is hard to see how state and local offi-\ncers could proceed in conformity with the Federal Govern-\nment’s enforcement priorities without making an inquiry\ninto a suspected alien’s immigration status. For example,\none of the Federal Government’s highest priorities is the\napprehension and removal of aliens who have failed to\ncomply with a final order of removal. See App. 108. How\ncan an officer identify those persons without first in-\nquiring about their status? At bottom, the discretion\nthat ultimately matters is not whether to verify a person’s\nimmigration status but whether to act once the person’s\nstatus is known. For that reason, §2(B)’s verification\n6                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nrequirement is not contrary to federal law because the\nFederal Government retains the discretion that matters\nmost––that is, the discretion to enforce the law in par-\nticular cases. If an Arizona officer contacts the Federal\nGovernment to verify a person’s immigration status and\nfederal records reveal that the person is in the coun-\ntry unlawfully, the Federal Government decides, presum-\nably based on its enforcement priorities, whether to have\nthe person released or transferred to federal custody.\nEnforcement discretion thus lies with the Federal Gov-\nernment, not with Arizona. Nothing in §2(B) suggests\notherwise.\n   The United States’ attack on §2(B) is quite remarkable.\nThe United States suggests that a state law may be pre-\nempted, not because it conflicts with a federal statute or\nregulation, but because it is inconsistent with a federal\nagency’s current enforcement priorities. Those priorities,\nhowever, are not law. They are nothing more than agency\npolicy. I am aware of no decision of this Court recognizing\nthat mere policy can have pre-emptive force. Cf. Barclays\nBank PLC v. Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal., 512 U. S. 298, 330\n(1994) (holding that “Executive Branch communications\nthat express federal policy but lack the force of law cannot\nrender unconstitutional” an “otherwise valid, congression-\nally condoned” state law). If §2(B) were pre-empted at\nthe present time because it is out of sync with the Federal\nGovernment’s current priorities, would it be unpre-empted\nat some time in the future if the agency’s priorities\nchanged?\n   Like most law enforcement agencies, ICE does not set\nout inflexible rules for its officers to follow. To the con-\ntrary, it provides a list of factors to guide its officers’\nenforcement discretion on a case-by-case basis. See Memo-\nrandum from John Morton, Director, ICE, to All Field\nOffice Directors et al., p. 4 (June 17, 2011) (“This list is not\nexhaustive and no one factor is determinative.

The decisions\nshould be based on the totality of the circumstances, with\nthe goal of conforming to ICE’s enforcement priorities”).\nAmong those factors is “the agency’s civil immigration\nenforcement priorities,” ibid., which change from admin-\nistration to administration. If accepted, the United States’\npre-emption argument would give the Executive unprece-\ndented power to invalidate state laws that do not meet\nwith its approval, even if the state laws are otherwise\nconsistent with federal statutes and duly promulgated\nregulations. This argument, to say the least, is fundamen-\ntally at odds with our federal system.\n                               B\n   It has been suggested that §2(B) will cause some per-\nsons who are lawfully stopped to be detained in violation\nof their constitutional rights while a prolonged investiga-\ntion of their immigration status is undertaken. But noth-\ning on the face of the law suggests that it will be enforced\nin a way that violates the Fourth Amendment or any other\nprovision of the Constitution. The law instructs officers to\nmake a “reasonable attempt” to investigate immigration\nstatus, and this language is best understood as incorporat-\ning the Fourth Amendment’s standard of reasonableness.\nIndeed, the Arizona Legislature has directed that §2(B)\n“shall be implemented in a manner consistent with federal\nlaws . . . protecting the civil rights of all persons and re-\nspecting the privileges and immunities of United States\ncitizens.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(L).\n   In the situations that seem most likely to occur, en-\nforcement of §2(B) will present familiar Fourth Amend-\nment questions. To take a common situation, suppose that\na car is stopped for speeding, a nonimmigration offense.\n(Recall that §2(B) comes into play only where a stop or\narrest is made for a nonimmigration offense.) Suppose\n8                ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nalso that the officer who makes the stop subsequently\nacquires reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver\nentered the country illegally, which is a federal crime. See\n8 U. S. C. §1325(a).\n   It is well established that state and local officers gener-\nally have authority to make stops and arrests for viola-\ntions of federal criminal laws. See, e.g., Miller v. United\nStates, 357 U. S. 301, 305 (1958); United States v. Di Re,\n332 U. S. 581, 589 (1948). I see no reason why this princi-\nple should not apply to immigration crimes as well. Lower\ncourts have so held. See, e.g., Estrada v. Rhode Island,\n594 F. 3d 56, 65 (CA1 2010) (upholding the lawfulness of\na detention because the officer had an objectively reason-\nable belief that the arrestees “had committed immigra-\ntion violations”); United States v. Vasquez-Alvarez, 176\nF. 3d 1294, 1296 (CA10 1999) (noting that “state law-\nenforcement officers have the general authority to investi-\ngate and make arrests for violations of federal immigra-\ntion laws”); Gonzales v. Peoria, 722 F. 2d 468, 475 (CA9\n1983), overruled on other grounds, Hodgers-Durgin v. de\nla Vina, 199 F. 3d 1037 (1999) (en banc) (holding that\n“federal law does not preclude local enforcement of the\ncriminal provisions” of federal immigration law). And the\nUnited States, consistent with the position long taken by\nthe Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of\nJustice, does not contend otherwise. See Brief for United\nStates 55, n. 33; see also Memorandum from OLC to the\nAttorney General (Apr. 3, 2002), App. 268–273; Assistance\nby State and Local Police in Apprehending Illegal Aliens,\n20 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 26 (1996).\n   More importantly, no federal statute casts doubt on this\nauthority. To be sure, there are a handful of statutes that\npurport to authorize state and local officers to make immi-\ngration-related arrests in certain situations. See, e.g., 8\nU. S. C. §1103(a)(10) (providing for the extension of “any”\nimmigration enforcement authority to state and local\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nofficers in the event of an “actual or imminent mass in-\nflux of aliens arriving off the coast”); §1252c(a) (provid-\ning authority to arrest criminal aliens who had illegally\nreentered the country but only after consultation with\nthe Federal Government); §1324(c) (providing authority\nto make arrests for transporting and harboring certain\naliens). But a grant of federal arrest authority in some\ncases does not manifest a clear congressional intent to\ndisplace the States’ police powers in all other cases. With-\nout more, such an inference is too weak to overcome our\npresumption against pre-emption where traditional state\npolice powers are at stake. Accordingly, in our hypothet-\nical case, the Arizona officer may arrest the driver for\nviolating §1325(a) if the officer has probable cause. And if\nthe officer has reasonable suspicion, the officer may detain\nthe driver, to the extent permitted by the Fourth Amend-\nment, while the question of illegal entry is investigated.\n   We have held that a detention based on reasonable\nsuspicion that the detainee committed a particular crime\n“can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time\nreasonably required to complete that mission.” Illinois v.\nCaballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407 (2005). But if during the\ncourse of a stop an officer acquires suspicion that a de-\ntainee committed a different crime, the detention may be\nextended for a reasonable time to verify or dispel that\nsuspicion. Cf. Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 101 (2005)\n(holding that “no additional Fourth Amendment justifica-\ntion” was required because any questioning concerning\nimmigration status did not prolong the detention). In our\nhypothetical case, therefore, if the officer, after initially\nstopping the car for speeding, has a reasonable suspicion\nthat the driver entered the country illegally, the officer\nmay investigate for evidence of illegal entry. But the\nlength and nature of this investigation must remain with-\nin the limits set out in our Fourth Amendment cases. An\ninvestigative stop, if prolonged, can become an arrest and\n10                 ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthus require probable cause. See Caballes, supra, at 407.\nSimilarly, if a person is moved from the site of the stop,\nprobable cause will likely be required. See Hayes v. Florida,\n470 U. S. 811, 816 (1985) (holding that the line be-\ntween detention and arrest is crossed “when the police,\nwithout probable cause or a warrant, forcibly remove a\nperson from his home or other place in which he is entitled\nto be and transport him to the police station, where he is\ndetained, although briefly, for investigative purposes”).\n   If properly implemented, §2(B) should not lead to fed-\neral constitutional violations, but there is no denying that\nenforcement of §2(B) will multiply the occasions on which\nsensitive Fourth Amendment issues will crop up. These\ncivil-liberty concerns, I take it, are at the heart of most\nobjections to §2(B). Close and difficult questions will in-\nevitably arise as to whether an officer had reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that a person who is stopped for some\nother reason entered the country illegally, and there is a\nrisk that citizens, lawful permanent residents, and others\nwho are lawfully present in the country will be detained.\nTo mitigate this risk, Arizona could issue guidance to\nofficers detailing the circumstances that typically give\nrise to reasonable suspicion of unlawful presence. And in\nthe spirit of the federal-state cooperation that the United\nStates champions, the Federal Government could share its\nown guidelines. Arizona could also provide officers with a\nnonexclusive list containing forms of identification suffi-\ncient under §2(B) to dispel any suspicion of unlawful\npresence. If Arizona accepts licenses from most States as\nproof of legal status, the problem of roadside detentions\nwill be greatly mitigated.1\n——————\n  1 When the Real ID Act takes effect, the Federal Government will no\n\nlonger accept state forms of identification that fail to meet certain\nfederal requirements. §202(a)(1), 119 Stat. 312. One requirement is\nthat any identification be issued only on proof that the applicant\nis lawfully present in the United States. §202(c)(2)(B), id., at 313. I\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

Although\nthere is some ambiguity in Hines, the Court largely spoke\nin the language of field pre-emption. The Court explained\nthat where Congress “has enacted a complete scheme of\nregulation and has therein provided a standard for the\nregistration of aliens, states cannot, inconsistently with\nthe purpose of Congress, conflict or interfere with, curtail\nor complement, the federal law, or enforce additional or\nauxiliary regulations.” 312 U. S., at 66–67. In finding the\nPennsylvania alien-registration law pre-empted, the Court\nobserved that Congress had “provided a standard for\nalien registration in a single integrated and all-embracing\nsystem” and that its intent was “to protect the personal\nliberties of law-abiding aliens through one uniform na-\ntional registration system.” Id., at 74. If we credit our\nholding in Hines that Congress has enacted “a single in-\ntegrated and all-embracing system” of alien registration\nand that States cannot “complement” that system or “en-\nforce additional or auxiliary regulations,” id., at 66–67, 74,\nthen Arizona’s attempt to impose additional, state-law\npenalties for violations of federal registration require-\nments must be invalidated.\n                       Section 5(C)\n  While I agree that §3 is pre-empted, I disagree with the\nCourt’s decision to strike down §5(C). I do so in large\nmeasure because the Court fails to give the same solici-\ntude to our decision in De Canas, 424 U. S. 351, as it is\nwilling to give our decision in Hines. In De Canas, the\nCourt upheld against a pre-emption challenge a state law\nimposing fines on employers that hired aliens who were\n\n—————— \n\nanticipate that most, if not all, States will eventually issue forms of\n\n\nidentification that suffice to establish lawful presence under §2(B). \n\n12              ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nunlawfully present in the United States. The Court ex-\nplained that the mere fact that “aliens are the subject of a\nstate statute does not render it a regulation of immigra-\ntion.” 424 U. S., at 355. The Court emphasized instead\nthat “States possess broad authority under their police\npowers to regulate the employment relationship to protect\nworkers within the State.” Id., at 356. In light of that\nbroad authority, the Court declared that “[o]nly a demon-\nstration that complete ouster of state power . . . was ‘the\nclear and manifest purpose of Congress’ would justify” the\nconclusion that “state regulation designed to protect vital\nstate interests must give way to paramount federal legis-\nlation.” Id., at 357 (some internal quotation marks omit-\nted); see also Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S.\n431, 449 (2005) (“In areas of traditional state regulation,\n[the Court] assume[s] that a federal statute has not sup-\nplanted state law unless Congress has made such an\nintention ‘clear and manifest’ ” (some internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   The Court now tells us that times have changed. Since\nDe Canas, Congress has enacted “a comprehensive frame-\nwork for combating the employment of illegal aliens,” and\neven though aliens who seek or obtain unauthorized work\nare not subject to criminal sanctions, they can suffer civil\npenalties. Ante, at 12–13 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Undoubtedly, federal regulation in this area is\nmore pervasive today. But our task remains unchanged:\nto determine whether the federal scheme discloses a clear\nand manifest congressional intent to displace state law.\n   The Court gives short shrift to our presumption against\npre-emption. Having no express statement of congres-\nsional intent to support its analysis, the Court infers from\nstale legislative history and from the comprehensiveness\nof the federal scheme that “Congress made a deliberate\nchoice not to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek,\nor engage in, unauthorized employment.” Ante, at 13.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nBecause §5(C) imposes such penalties, the Court concludes\nthat it stands as an obstacle to the method of enforcement\nchosen by Congress. Ante, at 15.\n   The one thing that is clear from the federal scheme is\nthat Congress chose not to impose federal criminal penal-\nties on aliens who seek or obtain unauthorized work. But\nthat does not mean that Congress also chose to pre-empt\nstate criminal penalties. The inference is plausible, but\nfar from necessary. As we have said before, the “decision\nnot to adopt a regulation” is not “the functional equivalent\nof a regulation prohibiting all States and their political\nsubdivisions from adopting such a regulation.” Sprietsma\nv. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 65 (2002). With any\nstatutory scheme, Congress chooses to do some things and\nnot others. If that alone were enough to demonstrate pre-\nemptive intent, there would be little left over for the\nStates to regulate, especially now that federal authority\nreaches so far and wide. States would occupy tiny islands\nin a sea of federal power. This explains why state laws\nimplicating traditional state powers are not pre-empted\nunless there is a “clear and manifest” congressional inten-\ntion to do so.\n   Not only is there little evidence that Congress intended\nto pre-empt state laws like §5(C), there is some evidence\nthat Congress intended the opposite result. In making it\nunlawful for employers to hire unauthorized aliens, see 8\nU. S. C. §1324a(a), Congress made it clear that “any State\nor local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other\nthan through licensing and similar laws)” upon employers\nwas pre-empted, §1324a(h)(2). Noticeably absent is any\nsimilar directive pre-empting state or local laws targeting\naliens who seek or obtain unauthorized employment.\nGiven that Congress expressly pre-empted certain state\nand local laws pertaining to employers but remained silent\nabout laws pertaining to employees, one could infer that\nCongress intended to preserve state and local authority to\n14              ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nregulate the employee side of the equation. At the very\nleast, it raises serious doubts about whether Congress\nintended to pre-empt such authority.\n   The Court dismisses any inferences that might be\ndrawn from the express pre-emption provision. See ante,\nat 14. But even though the existence of that provision\n“does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption\nprinciples” or impose a “ ‘special burden’ ” against pre-\nemption, Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S.\n861, 869–870 (2000), it is still probative of congressional\nintent. And it is the intent of Congress that is the “ulti-\nmate touchstone.” Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375\nU. S. 96, 103 (1963).\n   The Court infers from Congress’ decision not to impose\nfederal criminal penalties that Congress intended to pre-\nempt state criminal penalties. But given that the express\npre-emption provision covers only state and local laws\nregulating employers, one could just as well infer that\nCongress did not intend to pre-empt state or local laws\naimed at alien employees who unlawfully seek or obtain\nwork. Surely Congress’ decision not to extend its express\npre-emption provision to state or local laws like §5(C) is\nmore probative of its intent on the subject of pre-emption\nthan its decision not to impose federal criminal penalties\nfor unauthorized work. In any event, the point I wish\nto emphasize is that inferences can be drawn either way.\nThere are no necessary inferences that point decisively for\nor against pre-emption. Therefore, if we take seriously\nthat state employment regulation is a traditional state\nconcern and can be pre-empted only on a showing of\n“clear and manifest” congressional intent as required by De\nCanas, then §5(C) must survive. “Our precedents estab-\nlish that a high threshold must be met if a state law is to\nbe pre-empted for conflicting with the purposes of a fed-\neral Act.” Chamber of Commerce of United States of America\nv. Whiting, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (plurality opinion)\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

I do\nnot believe the United States has surmounted that barrier\nhere.\n                          Section 6\n   I also disagree with the Court’s decision that §6 is pre-\nempted. This provision adds little to the authority that\nArizona officers already possess, and whatever additional\nauthority it confers is consistent with federal law. Section\n6 amended an Arizona statute that authorizes warrantless\narrests. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. §13–3883 (West 2010). Be-\nfore §6 was added, that statute already permitted arrests\nwithout a warrant for felonies, misdemeanors committed\nin the arresting officer’s presence, petty offenses, and\ncertain traffic-related criminal violations.      See §§13–\n3883(A)(1)–(4). Largely duplicating the authority already\nconferred by these prior subsections, §6 added a new\nsubsection, §13–3883(A)(5) (West Supp. 2011), that au-\nthorizes officers to make warrantless arrests on probable\ncause that the arrestee has committed a “public offense”\nfor which the arrestee is removable from the United\nStates. A “public offense” is defined as conduct that is\npunishable by imprisonment or a fine according to the law\nof the State where the conduct occurred and that would be\npunishable under Arizona law had the conduct occurred in\nArizona. See §13–105(27).\n   In what way, if any, does §6 enlarge the arrest authority\nof Arizona officers? It has been suggested that §6 confers\nnew authority in the following three circumstances: (1)\nwhere the arrestee committed but has not been charged\nwith committing an offense in another State; (2) where the\nofficer has probable cause to believe the arrestee commit-\nted an offense for which he was previously arrested but\nnot prosecuted; and (3) where the arrestee committed but\nhas already served the sentence for a removable offense.\n641 F. 3d 359, 361 (CA9 2011). These are exceedingly\n16               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nnarrow categories, involving circumstances that will rarely\narise. But such cases are possible, and therefore we must\ndecide whether there are circumstances under which fed-\neral law precludes a state officer from making an arrest\nbased on probable cause that the arrestee committed a\nremovable offense.\n                              A\n   The idea that state and local officers may carry out\narrests in the service of federal law is not unprecedented.\nAs previously noted, our cases establish that state and\nlocal officers may make warrantless arrests for violations\nof federal law and that “in the absence of an applicable\nfederal statute the law of the state where an arrest with-\nout warrant takes place determines its validity.” Di Re,\n332 U. S., at 589; see also Miller, 357 U. S., at 305 (stating\nthat, where a state officer makes an arrest based on fed-\neral law, “the lawfulness of the arrest without warrant\nis to be determined by reference to state law”). Therefore,\ngiven the premise, which I understand both the United\nStates and the Court to accept, that state and local officers\ndo have inherent authority to make arrests in aid of fed-\neral law, we must ask whether Congress has done anything\nto curtail or pre-empt that authority in this particular\ncase.\n   Neither the United States nor the Court goes so far as to\nsay that state and local officers have no power to arrest\ncriminal aliens based on their removability. To do so\nwould fly in the face of 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10). Under\n§§1357(g)(1)–(9), the Federal Government may enter into\nformal agreements with States and municipalities under\nwhich their officers may perform certain duties of a fed-\neral immigration officer. But §1357(g)(10)(B) makes clear\nthat States and municipalities need not enter into those\nagreements “otherwise to cooperate . . . in the identifica-\ntion, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                17\n\n                         Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nlawfully present in the United States.” It goes without\nsaying that state and local officers could not provide\nmeaningful cooperation in the apprehension, detention,\nand ultimate removal of criminal aliens without some\npower to make arrests.\n  Although §1357(g)(10) contemplates state and local\nauthority to apprehend criminal aliens for the purpose of\nremoval, the Court rejects out of hand any possibility that\nofficers could exercise that authority without federal\ndirection. Despite acknowledging that there is “ambiguity\nas to what constitutes cooperation,” the Court says that\n“no coherent understanding of the term would incorporate\nthe unilateral decision of state officers to arrest an alien\nfor being removable absent any request, approval, or other\ninstruction from the Federal Government.” Ante, at 18.\nThe Court adopts an unnecessarily stunted view of coop-\neration. No one would say that a state or local officer\nhas failed to cooperate by making an on-the-spot arrest to\nenforce federal law. Unsolicited aid is not necessarily\nuncooperative.\n  To be sure, were an officer to persist in making an ar-\nrest that the officer knows is unwanted, such conduct\nwould not count as cooperation. But nothing in the rele-\nvant federal statutes suggests that Congress does not\nwant aliens who have committed removable offenses to be\narrested.2 To the contrary, §1226(c)(1) commands that the\nExecutive “shall take into custody any alien” who is de-\nportable for having committed a specified offense. And\n§1226(c)(2) substantially limits the circumstances under\nwhich the Executive has discretion to release aliens held\nin custody under paragraph (1). So if an officer arrests an\nalien who is removable for having committed one of the\ncrimes listed in §1226(c)(1), the Federal Government is\n——————\n  2 That goes for the Executive Branch as well, which has made the\n\napprehension and removal of criminal aliens a priority. See App. 108.\n18              ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nobligated to take the alien into custody.\n  That Congress generally requires the Executive to take\ncustody of criminal aliens casts considerable doubt on the\nCourt’s concern that §6 is an obstacle to the Federal Gov-\nernment’s exercise of discretion. The Court claims that\nthe authority conferred by §6 “could be exercised without\nany input from the Federal Government about whether\nan arrest is warranted in a particular case” and that this\n“would allow the State to achieve its own immigration\npolicy,” resulting in the “unnecessary harassment of some\naliens . . . whom federal officials determine should not be\nremoved.” Ante, at 17. But §1226(c)(1) belies the Court’s\nfear. In many, if not most, cases involving aliens who are\nremovable for having committed criminal offenses, Con-\ngress has left the Executive no discretion but to take the\nalien into custody. State and local officers do not frus-\ntrate the removal process by arresting criminal aliens.\nThe Executive retains complete discretion over whether\nthose aliens are ultimately removed. And once the Fed-\neral Government makes a determination that a particular\ncriminal alien will not be removed, then Arizona officers\nare presumably no longer authorized under §6 to arrest\nthe alien.\n  To be sure, not all offenses for which officers have au-\nthority to arrest under §6 are covered by §1226(c)(1). As\nfor aliens who have committed those offenses, Congress\nhas given the Executive discretion under §1226(a) over\nwhether to arrest and detain them pending a decision on\nremoval. But the mere fact that the Executive has en-\nforcement discretion cannot mean that the exercise of\nstate police powers in support of federal law is automati-\ncally pre-empted. If that were true, then state and local\nofficers could never make arrests to enforce any federal\nstatute because the Executive always has at least some\ngeneral discretion over the enforcement of federal law as a\npractical matter. But even assuming that the express\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                  19\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nstatutory grant of discretion in §1226(a) somehow indi-\ncates a congressional desire to pre-empt unilateral state\nand local authority to arrest criminal aliens covered by\nthat provision, §6 is not pre-empted on its face given its\nsubstantial overlap with §1226(c)(1).\n   It bears emphasizing that §6 does not mandate the\nwarrantless apprehension of all aliens who have commit-\nted crimes for which they are removable. Instead, it only\ngrants state and local officers permission to make such\narrests. The trouble with this premature, facial challenge\nis that it affords Arizona no opportunity to implement\nits law in a way that would avoid any potential conflicts\nwith federal law. For example, Arizona could promulgate\nguidelines or regulations limiting the arrest authority\nconferred by §6 to the crimes specified in §1226(c)(1). And\nto the extent §1226(c)(1) is unclear about which exact\ncrimes are covered,3 Arizona could go even further and\nidentify specific crimes for which there is no doubt an\nalien would be removable. The point is that there are\nplenty of permissible applications of §6, and the Court\nshould not invalidate the statute at this point without at\nleast some indication that Arizona has implemented it in a\nmanner at odds with Congress’ clear and manifest intent.\nWe have said that a facial challenge to a statute is “the\nmost difficult challenge to mount successfully” because “the\nchallenger must establish that no set of circumstances\nexists under which the [statute] would be valid.” United\nStates v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987); see also\nAnderson v. Edwards, 514 U. S. 143, 155, n. 6 (1995)\n(applying the Salerno standard in a pre-emption case). As\nto §6, I do not believe the United States has carried that\n\n——————\n  3I readily admit that it can be difficult to determine whether a\nparticular conviction will necessarily make an alien removable. See\nPadilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (ALITO, J., concurring in\njudgment) (slip op., at 4).\n20               ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nheavy burden.\n                               B\n   Finally, the Court tells us that §6 conflicts with federal\nlaw because it provides state and local officers with “even\ngreater authority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible\nremovability than Congress has given to trained federal\nimmigration officers.” Ante, at 16–17. The Court points to\n8 U. S. C. §1357(a)(2), which empowers “authorized” offi-\ncers and employees of ICE to make arrests without a fed-\neral warrant if “the alien so arrested is in the United States\nin violation of any [immigration] law or regulation and is\nlikely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his\narrest.” Because §6 would allow Arizona officers to make\narrests “regardless of whether a federal warrant has\nissued or the alien is likely to escape,” ante, at 17, the\nCourt concludes that §6 is an obstacle to the accomplish-\nment of Congress’ objectives. But §6 is an obstacle only to\nthe extent it conflicts with Congress’ clear and manifest\nintent to preclude state and local officers from making\narrests except where a federal warrant has issued or the\narrestee is likely to escape. By granting warrantless\narrest authority to federal officers, Congress has not mani-\nfested an unmistakable intent to strip state and local\nofficers of their warrantless arrest authority under state\nlaw.\n   Likewise, limitations on federal arrest authority do not\nmean that the arrest authority of state and local officers\nmust be similarly limited. Our opinion in Miller, 357 U. S.\n301, is instructive. In that case, a District of Columbia\nofficer, accompanied by a federal officer, made an arrest\nbased on a suspected federal narcotics offense. Id., at\n303–304. The federal officer did not have statutory au-\nthorization to arrest without a warrant, but the local\nofficer did. Id., at 305. We held that District of Columbia\nlaw dictated the lawfulness of the arrest. Id., at 305–306.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          21\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nWhere a state or local officer makes a warrantless arrest\nto enforce federal law, we said that “the lawfulness of the\narrest without warrant is to be determined by reference to\nstate law.” Id., at 305. Under §6, an Arizona officer may\nbe authorized to make an arrest that a federal officer may\nnot be authorized to make under §1357(a)(2). As Miller\nmakes clear, that fact alone does not render arrests by\nstate or local officers pursuant to §6 unlawful. Nor does it\nmanifest a clear congressional intent to displace the exer-\ncise of state police powers that are brought to bear in aid\nof federal law.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/802971/", "sha1": "bd09c81379db3ea07fb7b5f646624f28d63d5e9a", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-06-25T08:23:18"}
