BORMES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 11–192.      Argued October 2, 2012—Decided November 13, 2012\nRespondent Bormes, an attorney, filed suit against the Federal Gov-\n  ernment, alleging that the electronic receipt he received when paying\n  his client’s federal-court filing fee on Pay.gov included the last four\n  digits of his credit card number and the card’s expiration date, in\n  willful violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U. S. C.\n  §1681 et seq. He sought damages under §1681n and asserted juris-\n  diction under §1681p, as well as under the Little Tucker Act, which\n  grants district courts “original jurisdiction, concurrent with the Unit-\n  ed States Court of Federal Claims, of . . . [a]ny. . . civil action or claim\n  against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded\n  . . . upon . . . any Act of Congress,” 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2). In dis-\n  missing the suit, the District Court held that FCRA did not explicitly\n  waive the Federal Government’s sovereign immunity. Bormes ap-\n  pealed to the Federal Circuit, which vacated the District Court’s deci-\n  sion, holding that the Little Tucker Act provided the Government’s\n  consent to suit because the underlying statute—FCRA—could fairly\n  be interpreted as mandating a right of recovery in damages.\nHeld: The Little Tucker Act does not waive the Government’s sovereign\n immunity with respect to FCRA damages actions. Pp. 4–11.\n    (a) The Little Tucker Act and its companion statute, the Tucker\n Act, provide the Federal Government’s consent to suit for certain\n money-damages claims “premised on other sources of law,” United\n States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. 287, 290. The general terms of the\n Tucker Acts are displaced, however, when a law imposing monetary\n liability has its own judicial remedies. In that event, the specific re-\n medial scheme establishes the exclusive framework for determining\n the scope of liability under the statute. See, e.g., Hinck v. United\n States, 550 U. S. 501. Pp. 4–7.\n2                      UNITED STATES v. BORMES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (b) FCRA is such a statute. Its detailed remedial scheme sets “out\n    a carefully circumscribed, time-limited, plaintiff-specific” cause of ac-\n    tion, and “also precisely define[s] the appropriate forum,” 550 U. S.,\n    at 507. FCRA authorizes aggrieved consumers to hold “any person”\n    who “willfully” or “negligent[ly]” fails to comply with the Act’s re-\n    quirements liable for specified damages, 15 U. S. C. §§1681n(a),\n    1681o; requires enforcement claims to be brought within a specified\n    limitations period, §1681p; and provides that jurisdiction will lie “in\n    any appropriate United States district court, without regard to the\n    amount in controversy,” ibid. Because FCRA enables claimants to\n    pursue monetary relief in court without resort to the Tucker Act, only\n    its own text can determine whether Congress unequivocally intended\n    to impose the statute’s damages liability on the Federal Government.\n    Pp. 7–10.\n626 F. 3d 574, vacated and remanded.\n\n    SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                        Cite as: 568 U.

JAMES X. BORMES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n                             [November 13, 2012]\n\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n    The Little Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2), provides\nthat “[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction,\nconcurrent with the United States Court of Federal\nClaims, of . . . [a]ny. . . civil action or claim against the\nUnited States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded\n. . . upon . . . any Act of Congress.” We consider whether\nthe Little Tucker Act waives the sovereign immunity of\nthe United States with respect to damages actions for\nviolations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15\nU. S. C. §1681 et seq.\n                               I\n  The Fair Credit Reporting Act has as one of its purposes\nto “protect consumer privacy.” Safeco Ins. Co. of America\nv. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 52 (2007); see 84 Stat. 1128, 15\nU. S. C. §1681. To that end, FCRA provides, among other\nthings, that “no person that accepts credit cards or debit\ncards for the transaction of business shall print more than\nthe last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date\nupon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of\nthe sale or transaction.” §1681c(g)(1) (emphasis added).\nThe Act defines “person” as “any individual, partnership,\n2                UNITED STATES v. BORMES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncorporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, gov-\nernment or governmental subdivision or agency, or other\nentity.” §1681a(b).\n   FCRA imposes civil liability for willful or negligent\nnoncompliance with its requirements: “Any person who\nwillfully fails to comply” with the Act “with respect to any\nconsumer,” “is liable to that consumer” for actual damages\nor damages “of not less than $100 and not more than\n$1,000,” as well as punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and\ncosts. §1681n(a); see also §1681o (civil liability for negli-\ngent noncompliance). The Act includes a jurisdictional\nprovision, which provides that “[a]n action to enforce any\nliability created under this subchapter may be brought\nin any appropriate United States district court, without\nregard to the amount in controversy, or in any other court\nof competent jurisdiction” within the earlier of “2 years\nafter the date of discovery by the plaintiff of the violation\nthat is the basis for such liability” or “5 years after the\ndate on which the violation that is the basis for such liabil-\nity occurs.” §1681p.\n   Respondent James X. Bormes is an attorney who filed\na putative class action against the United States in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\nIllinois seeking damages under FCRA. Bormes alleged\nthat he paid a $350 federal-court filing fee for a client\nusing his own credit card on Pay.gov, an Internet-based\nsystem used by federal courts and dozens of federal agen-\ncies to process online payment transactions. According\nto Bormes, his Pay.gov electronic receipt included the last\nfour digits of his credit card, in addition to its expiration\ndate, in willful violation of §1681c(g)(1). He claimed that\nhe and thousands of similarly situated persons were enti-\ntled to recover damages under §1681n, and asserted juris-\ndiction under §1681p, as well as under the Little Tucker\nAct, 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2).\n   The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">958</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 962 (ND Ill. 2009).\nThe court did not address the Little Tucker Act as an\nasserted basis for jurisdiction. Respondent appealed to\nthe Federal Circuit, which has exclusive jurisdiction “of an\nappeal from a final decision of a district court of the\nUnited States . . . if the jurisdiction of that court was\nbased, in whole or in part, on” the Little Tucker Act. 28\nU. S. C. §1295(a)(2). Arguing that the Little Tucker Act’s\njurisdictional grant did not apply to respondent’s suit,\nthe Government moved to transfer the appeal to the\nSeventh Circuit.\n   The Federal Circuit denied the transfer motion and\nwent on to vacate the District Court’s decision. Without\ndeciding whether FCRA itself contained the requisite\nwaiver of sovereign immunity, the court held that the\nLittle Tucker Act provided the Government’s consent to\nsuit for violation of FCRA. The court explained that the\nLittle Tucker Act applied because FCRA “ ‘can fairly be\ninterpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal\nGovernment for the damage sustained.’ ” 626 F. 3d 574,\n578 (2010) (quoting United States v. White Mountain\nApache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 472 (2003)). This “fair inter-\npretation” rule, the court explained, “demands a showing\n‘demonstrably lower’ than the initial waiver of sovereign\nimmunity” contained in the Little Tucker Act itself. 626\nF. 3d, at 578. The court reasoned that FCRA satisfied the\n“fair interpretation” rule because its damages provision\napplies to “any person” who willfully violates its require-\nments, 15 U. S. C. §1681n(a), and the Act elsewhere de-\nfines “person” to include “any . . . government,” §1681a(b).\n626 F. 3d, at 580. The Federal Circuit remanded to the\nDistrict Court for further proceedings. We granted certio-\nrari, 565 U. S. ___ (2012).\n4                   UNITED STATES v. BORMES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             II\n\n   Sovereign immunity shields the United States from suit\nabsent a consent to be sued that is “ ‘unequivocally ex-\npressed.’ ” United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S.\n30, 33–34 (1992) (quoting Irwin v. Department of Veterans\nAffairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95 (1990); some internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Little Tucker Act is one statute that\nunequivocally provides the Federal Government’s consent\nto suit for certain money-damages claims. United States v.\nMitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 216 (1983) (Mitchell II ). Subject\nto exceptions not relevant here, the Little Tucker Act\nprovides that “district courts shall have original jurisdic-\ntion, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal\nClaims,” of a “civil action or claim against the United\nStates, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded either\nupon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any\nregulation of an executive department, or upon any ex-\npress or implied contract with the United States, or for\nliquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding\nin tort.” 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2).1 The Little Tucker Act\nand its companion statute, the Tucker Act, §1491(a)(1),2\ndo not themselves “creat[e] substantive rights,” but “are\nsimply jurisdictional provisions that operate to waive\n——————\n   1 It is undisputed that this class action satisfied the Little Tucker\n\nAct’s amount-in-controversy limitation. We have held that to require\nonly that the “claims of individual members of the clas[s] do not exceed\n$10,000.” United States v. Will, 449 U. S. 200, 211, n. 10 (1980).\n   2 Whereas the Little Tucker Act creates jurisdiction in the district\n\ncourts concurrent with the Court of Federal Claims for covered claims\nof $10,000 or less, the Tucker Act assigns jurisdiction to the Court of\nFederal Claims regardless of monetary amount. As relevant here, the\nscope of the two statutes is otherwise the same. The third statute in\nthe Tucker Act trio, the Indian Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. §1505, “confers a\nlike waiver for Indian tribal claims that ‘otherwise would be cognizable\nin the Court of Federal Claims if the claimant were not an Indian\ntribe.’ ” United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465,\n472 (2003) (quoting §1505).\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

S. 287,\n290 (2009).\n  Bormes argues that whether or not FCRA itself unam-\nbiguously waives sovereign immunity, the Little Tucker Act\nauthorizes his FCRA damages claim against the United\nStates. The question, then, is whether a damages claim\nunder FCRA “falls within the terms of the Tucker Act,” so\nthat “the United States has presumptively consented to\nsuit.” Mitchell II, supra, at 216. It does not. Where, as in\nFCRA, a statute contains its own self-executing remedial\nscheme, we look only to that statute to determine whether\nCongress intended to subject the United States to dam-\nages liability.\n                                A\n  The Court of Claims was established, and the Tucker\nAct enacted, to open a judicial avenue for certain mone-\ntary claims against the United States. Before the creation\nof the Court of Claims in 1855, see Act of Feb. 24, 1855\n(1855 Act), ch. 122, §1, 10 Stat. 612, it was not uncommon\nfor statutes to impose monetary obligations on the United\nStates without specifying a means of judicial enforce-\nment.3 As a result, claimants routinely petitioned Con-\ngress for private bills to recover money owed by the Federal\nGovernment. See Mitchell II, supra, at 212 (citing P.\nBator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro & H. Wechsler, Hart and\n——————\n  3 For example, the Act of March 30, 1814, provided that every non-\n\ncommissioned U. S. army officer who “may be captured by the enemy,\nshall be entitled to receive during his captivity . . . the same pay,\nsubsistence, and allowance to which he may be entitled whilst in the\nactual service of the United States.” §14, 3 Stat. 115, repealed in 1962\nby Pub. L. 87–649, §14, 76 Stat. 498. The 1814 Act clearly “com-\nmand[ed] the payment of a specified amount of money by the United\nStates,” Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879, 923 (1988) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting), but did not designate a means of judicial relief in the event\nthe Government failed to pay.\n6                   UNITED STATES v. BORMES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nWechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 98\n(2d ed. 1973)). As this individualized legislative process\nbecame increasingly burdensome for Congress, the Court\nof Claims was created “to relieve the pressure on Congress\ncaused by the volume of private bills.” Glidden Co. v.\nZdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 552 (1962) (plurality opinion). The\n1855 Act authorized the Court of Claims to hear claims\nagainst the United States “founded upon any law of Con-\ngress,” §1, 10 Stat. 612, and thus allowed claimants to\nsue the Federal Government for monetary relief premised\non other sources of law. (Specialized legislation remained\nnecessary to authorize the payments approved by the\nCourt of Claims until 1863, when Congress empowered the\ncourt to enter final judgments. See Act of Mar. 3, 1863\n(1863 Act), ch. 92, 12 Stat. 765; Mitchell II, supra, at 212–\n214 (recounting the history of the Court of Claims)).\n   Enacted in 1887, the Tucker Act was the successor\nstatute to the 1855 and 1863 Acts and replaced most of\ntheir provisions. See Act of Mar. 3, 1887 (1887 Act), ch.\n359, 24 Stat. 505; Mitchell II, supra, at 213–214. Like the\n1855 Act before it, the Tucker Act provided the Federal\nGovernment’s consent to suit in the Court of Claims for\nclaims “founded upon . . . any law of Congress.” 1887 Act\n§1, 24 Stat. 505. Section 2 of the 1887 Act created concur-\nrent jurisdiction in the district courts for claims of up to\n$1,000. The Tucker Act’s jurisdictional grant, and accom-\npanying immunity waiver, supplied the missing ingredient\nfor an action against the United States for the breach of\nmonetary obligations not otherwise judicially enforceable.4\n——————\n   4 For purposes of this case, the current versions of the Tucker Act and\n\nLittle Tucker Act resemble the 1887 Act. Compare 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1)\n(permitting suits “founded . . . upon . . . any Act of Congress”) with\nTucker Act §1, 24 Stat. 505 (permitting suits “founded upon . . . any law\nof Congress, except for pensions”). The prior functions of the Court of\nClaims are now divided between the Court of Federal Claims at the\ntrial level and the Federal Circuit at the appellate.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               B\n\n  The Tucker Act is displaced, however, when a law as-\nsertedly imposing monetary liability on the United States\ncontains its own judicial remedies. In that event, the\nspecific remedial scheme establishes the exclusive frame-\nwork for the liability Congress created under the statute.\nBecause a “precisely drawn, detailed statute pre-empts\nmore general remedies,” Hinck v. United States, 550 U. S.\n501, 506 (2007) (quoting EC Term of Years Trust v. United\nStates, 550 U. S. 429, 434 (2007); internal quotation marks\nomitted), FCRA’s self-executing remedial scheme super-\nsedes the gap-filling role of the Tucker Act.\n  We have long recognized that an additional remedy in\nthe Court of Claims is foreclosed when it contradicts the\nlimits of a precise remedial scheme. In Nichols v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87990\"><a href=\"/scotus/sa5/nichols-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 131 (1869), the issue was whether the\n1855 Act authorized suit in the Court of Claims for im-\nproper assessment of duties on imported liquor that had\nalready been paid without protest. The Court held that it\ndid not. The revenue laws already provided a remedy: An\naggrieved merchant could sue to recover the tax, but only\nafter paying the duty under protest. Act of Feb. 26, 1845,\nch. 22, 5 Stat. 727. The Court rejected the supposition\nthat “Congress, after having carefully constructed a reve-\nnue system, with ample provisions to redress wrong,\nintended to give to the taxpayer and importer a further\nand different remedy.” 7 Wall., at 131. Permitting suit\nunder the 1855 Act, the Court concluded, would frustrate\ncongressional intent with respect to the specific remedial\nscheme already in place. The 1855 Act was confined to a\ngap-filling role. As we said in a later case, “the general\nlaws which govern the Court of Claims may be resorted\nto for relief ” only because “[n]o special remedy has been\nprovided” to enforce a payment to which the claimant was\nentitled. United States v. Kaufman, 96 U. S. 567, 569\n(1878). Where the “liability is one created by statute,” the\n8                   UNITED STATES v. BORMES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n“special remedy provided by the same statute is exclusive.”\nIbid.\n   Our more recent cases have consistently held that statu-\ntory schemes with their own remedial framework exclude\nalternative relief under the general terms of the Tucker\nAct. See, e.g., Hinck, supra; United States v. Fausto, 484\nU. S. 439 (1988); United States v. Erika, Inc., 456 U. S.\n201 (1982). Respondent contends that in each of those\ncases Congress had unambiguously demonstrated its\nintent to foreclose additional review by the Court of Fed-\neral Claims—whereas here, no similar intent to preclude\nTucker Act jurisdiction is apparent. See Brief for Re-\nspondent 27–28. But our precedents collectively stand for\na more basic proposition: Where a specific statutory\nscheme provides the accoutrements of a judicial action, the\nmetes and bounds of the liability Congress intended to\ncreate can only be divined from the text of the statute\nitself.5\n   In Hinck, for example, we held that the Tax Court pro-\nvides the exclusive forum for suits under 26 U. S. C.\n§6404(h), which authorizes judicial review of the Secre-\ntary’s decision not to abate interest under §6404(e)(1). We\nrelied on “our past recognition that when Congress enacts\na specific remedy when no remedy was previously recog-\nnized . . . the remedy provided is generally regarded as\n——————\n   5 We therefore need not resolve the parties’ disagreement about\n\nwhether certain inconsistencies between the Little Tucker Act and\nFCRA can be reconciled. Compare 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2) (no claims in\ndistrict court “exceeding $10,000 in amount”) with 15 U. S. C. §1681p\n(claims may be brought in district court “without regard to the amount\nin controversy”); compare 28 U. S. C. §2501 (claims must be filed in the\nCourt of Federal Claims within six years of accrual) with 15 U. S. C.\n§1681p (claims under FCRA must be filed within the earlier of two\nyears after discovery or five years after the alleged violation). Recon-\ncilable or not, FCRA governs. The Government also contends that the\nTucker Act does not apply because §§1681n and 1681o sound in tort.\nWe do not decide the merits of that alternative argument.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexclusive.” 550 U. S., at 506. Section 6404(h), we con-\ncluded, “fits the bill”: it “provides a forum for adjudication,\na limited class of potential plaintiffs, a statute of limita-\ntions, a standard of review, and authorization for judicial\nrelief.” Ibid. It did not matter that Congress “fail[ed]\nexplicitly to define the Tax Court’s jurisdiction as exclu-\nsive.” Ibid. We found it “quite plain that the terms of\n§6404(h)—a ‘precisely drawn, detailed statute’ filling a\nperceived hole in the law—control all requests for review\nof §6404(e)(1) determinations.” Ibid.\n   Like §6404(h), FCRA creates a detailed remedial\nscheme. Its provisions “set out a carefully circumscribed,\ntime-limited, plaintiff-specific” cause of action, and “also\nprecisely define the appropriate forum.” Id., at 507. It\nauthorizes aggrieved consumers to hold “any person” who\n“willfully” or “negligent[ly]” fails to comply with the Act’s\nrequirements liable for specified damages. 15 U. S. C.\n§§1681n(a), 1681o. Claims to enforce liability must be\nbrought within a specified limitations period, §1681p, and\njurisdiction will lie “in any appropriate United States dis-\ntrict court, without regard to the amount in controversy,\nor in any other court of competent jurisdiction.” Ibid.\nWithout resort to the Tucker Act, FCRA enables claimants\nto pursue in court the monetary relief contemplated by the\nstatute.\n   Plaintiffs cannot, therefore, mix and match FCRA’s\nprovisions with the Little Tucker Act’s immunity waiver to\ncreate an action against the United States. Since FCRA\nis a detailed remedial scheme, only its own text can de-\ntermine whether the damages liability Congress crafted\nextends to the Federal Government. To hold otherwise—\nto permit plaintiffs to remedy the absence of a waiver of\nsovereign immunity in specific, detailed statutes by plead-\ning general Tucker Act jurisdiction—would transform the\nsovereign-immunity landscape.\n   The Federal Circuit was therefore wrong to conclude\n10               UNITED STATES v. BORMES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the Tucker Act justified applying a “less stringent”\nsovereign-immunity analysis to FCRA than our cases\nrequire. 626 F. 3d, at 582. It distorted our case law in\napplying to FCRA the immunity-waiver standard we\nexpressed in White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S., at\n472: whether the statute “ ‘can fairly be interpreted as\nmandating compensation by the Federal Government for\nthe damage sustained.’ ” 626 F. 3d, at 578. That is the\ntest for determining whether a statute that imposes an\nobligation but does not provide the elements of a cause of\naction qualifies for suit under the Tucker Act—more spe-\ncifically, whether the failure to perform an obligation\nundoubtedly imposed on the Federal Government creates\na right to monetary relief. See White Mountain Apache\nTribe, supra; Mitchell II, 463 U. S. 206. That test is not\nrelevant when a “mandate of compensation” is contained\nin a statute that provides a detailed judicial remedy\nagainst those who are subject to its requirements. FCRA\nis such a statute. By using the “fair interpretation” test to\ndetermine whether FCRA’s civil liability provisions apply\nto the United States, the Federal Circuit directed the test\nto a purpose for which it was not designed and leapfrogged\nthe threshold concern that the Tucker Act cannot be su-\nperimposed on an existing remedial scheme.\n                         *   *    *\n  We do not decide here whether FCRA itself waives the\nFederal Government’s immunity to damages actions under\n§1681n. That question is for the Seventh Circuit to con-\nsider once this case is transferred to it on remand. But\nwhether or not FCRA contains the necessary waiver of\nimmunity, any attempt to append a Tucker Act remedy to\nthe statute’s existing remedial scheme interferes with its\nintended scope of liability.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and\nthe case remanded with instructions to transfer the case to\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Argued October 2, 2012—Decided November 13, 2012\nRespondent Bormes, an attorney, filed suit against the Federal Gov-\n  ernment, alleging that the electronic receipt he received when paying\n  his client’s federal-court filing fee on Pay.gov included the last four\n  digits of his credit card number and the card’s expiration date, in\n  willful violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U. S. C.\n  §1681 et seq. He sought damages under §1681n and asserted juris-\n  diction under §1681p, as well as under the Little Tucker Act, which\n  grants district courts “original jurisdiction, concurrent with the Unit-\n  ed States Court of Federal Claims, of . . . [a]ny. . . civil action or claim\n  against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded\n  . . . upon . . . any Act of Congress,” 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2). In dis-\n  missing the suit, the District Court held that FCRA did not explicitly\n  waive the Federal Government’s sovereign immunity. Bormes ap-\n  pealed to the Federal Circuit, which vacated the District Court’s deci-\n  sion, holding that the Little Tucker Act provided the Government’s\n  consent to suit because the underlying statute—FCRA—could fairly\n  be interpreted as mandating a right of recovery in damages.\nHeld: The Little Tucker Act does not waive the Government’s sovereign\n immunity with respect to FCRA damages actions. Pp. 4–11.\n    (a) The Little Tucker Act and its companion statute, the Tucker\n Act, provide the Federal Government’s consent to suit for certain\n money-damages claims “premised on other sources of law,” United\n States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. 287, 290. The general terms of the\n Tucker Acts are displaced, however, when a law imposing monetary\n liability has its own judicial remedies. In that event, the specific re-\n medial scheme establishes the exclusive framework for determining\n the scope of liability under the statute. See, e.g., Hinck v. United\n States, 550 U. S. 501. Pp. 4–7.\n2                      UNITED STATES v. BORMES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (b) FCRA is such a statute.

FCRA authorizes aggrieved consumers to hold “any person”\n    who “willfully” or “negligent[ly]” fails to comply with the Act’s re-\n    quirements liable for specified damages, 15 U. S. C. §§1681n(a),\n    1681o; requires enforcement claims to be brought within a specified\n    limitations period, §1681p; and provides that jurisdiction will lie “in\n    any appropriate United States district court, without regard to the\n    amount in controversy,” ibid. Because FCRA enables claimants to\n    pursue monetary relief in court without resort to the Tucker Act, only\n    its own text can determine whether Congress unequivocally intended\n    to impose the statute’s damages liability on the Federal Government.\n    Pp. 7–10.\n626 F. 3d 574, vacated and remanded.\n\n    SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                        Cite as: 568 U.

JAMES X. BORMES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n                             [November 13, 2012]\n\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n    The Little Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2), provides\nthat “[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction,\nconcurrent with the United States Court of Federal\nClaims, of . . . [a]ny. . . civil action or claim against the\nUnited States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded\n. . . upon . . . any Act of Congress.” We consider whether\nthe Little Tucker Act waives the sovereign immunity of\nthe United States with respect to damages actions for\nviolations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15\nU. S. C. §1681 et seq.\n                               I\n  The Fair Credit Reporting Act has as one of its purposes\nto “protect consumer privacy.” Safeco Ins. Co. of America\nv. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 52 (2007); see 84 Stat. 1128, 15\nU. S. C. §1681. To that end, FCRA provides, among other\nthings, that “no person that accepts credit cards or debit\ncards for the transaction of business shall print more than\nthe last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date\nupon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of\nthe sale or transaction.” §1681c(g)(1) (emphasis added).\nThe Act defines “person” as “any individual, partnership,\n2                UNITED STATES v. BORMES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncorporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, gov-\nernment or governmental subdivision or agency, or other\nentity.” §1681a(b).\n   FCRA imposes civil liability for willful or negligent\nnoncompliance with its requirements: “Any person who\nwillfully fails to comply” with the Act “with respect to any\nconsumer,” “is liable to that consumer” for actual damages\nor damages “of not less than $100 and not more than\n$1,000,” as well as punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and\ncosts. §1681n(a); see also §1681o (civil liability for negli-\ngent noncompliance). The Act includes a jurisdictional\nprovision, which provides that “[a]n action to enforce any\nliability created under this subchapter may be brought\nin any appropriate United States district court, without\nregard to the amount in controversy, or in any other court\nof competent jurisdiction” within the earlier of “2 years\nafter the date of discovery by the plaintiff of the violation\nthat is the basis for such liability” or “5 years after the\ndate on which the violation that is the basis for such liabil-\nity occurs.” §1681p.\n   Respondent James X. Bormes is an attorney who filed\na putative class action against the United States in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\nIllinois seeking damages under FCRA. Bormes alleged\nthat he paid a $350 federal-court filing fee for a client\nusing his own credit card on Pay.gov, an Internet-based\nsystem used by federal courts and dozens of federal agen-\ncies to process online payment transactions. According\nto Bormes, his Pay.gov electronic receipt included the last\nfour digits of his credit card, in addition to its expiration\ndate, in willful violation of §1681c(g)(1). He claimed that\nhe and thousands of similarly situated persons were enti-\ntled to recover damages under §1681n, and asserted juris-\ndiction under §1681p, as well as under the Little Tucker\nAct, 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2).\n   The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFCRA does not contain the explicit waiver of sovereign\nimmunity necessary to permit a damages suit against the\nUnited States. 638 F. Supp. 2d 958, 962 (ND Ill. 2009).\nThe court did not address the Little Tucker Act as an\nasserted basis for jurisdiction. Respondent appealed to\nthe Federal Circuit, which has exclusive jurisdiction “of an\nappeal from a final decision of a district court of the\nUnited States . . . if the jurisdiction of that court was\nbased, in whole or in part, on” the Little Tucker Act. 28\nU. S. C. §1295(a)(2). Arguing that the Little Tucker Act’s\njurisdictional grant did not apply to respondent’s suit,\nthe Government moved to transfer the appeal to the\nSeventh Circuit.\n   The Federal Circuit denied the transfer motion and\nwent on to vacate the District Court’s decision. Without\ndeciding whether FCRA itself contained the requisite\nwaiver of sovereign immunity, the court held that the\nLittle Tucker Act provided the Government’s consent to\nsuit for violation of FCRA. The court explained that the\nLittle Tucker Act applied because FCRA “ ‘can fairly be\ninterpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal\nGovernment for the damage sustained.’ ” 626 F. 3d 574,\n578 (2010) (quoting United States v. White Mountain\nApache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 472 (2003)). This “fair inter-\npretation” rule, the court explained, “demands a showing\n‘demonstrably lower’ than the initial waiver of sovereign\nimmunity” contained in the Little Tucker Act itself. 626\nF. 3d, at 578. The court reasoned that FCRA satisfied the\n“fair interpretation” rule because its damages provision\napplies to “any person” who willfully violates its require-\nments, 15 U. S. C. §1681n(a), and the Act elsewhere de-\nfines “person” to include “any . . . government,” §1681a(b).\n626 F. 3d, at 580. The Federal Circuit remanded to the\nDistrict Court for further proceedings. We granted certio-\nrari, 565 U. S. ___ (2012).\n4                   UNITED STATES v. BORMES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             II\n\n   Sovereign immunity shields the United States from suit\nabsent a consent to be sued that is “ ‘unequivocally ex-\npressed.’ ” United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S.\n30, 33–34 (1992) (quoting Irwin v. Department of Veterans\nAffairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95 (1990); some internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Little Tucker Act is one statute that\nunequivocally provides the Federal Government’s consent\nto suit for certain money-damages claims. United States v.\nMitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 216 (1983) (Mitchell II ). Subject\nto exceptions not relevant here, the Little Tucker Act\nprovides that “district courts shall have original jurisdic-\ntion, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal\nClaims,” of a “civil action or claim against the United\nStates, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded either\nupon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any\nregulation of an executive department, or upon any ex-\npress or implied contract with the United States, or for\nliquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding\nin tort.” 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2).1 The Little Tucker Act\nand its companion statute, the Tucker Act, §1491(a)(1),2\ndo not themselves “creat[e] substantive rights,” but “are\nsimply jurisdictional provisions that operate to waive\n——————\n   1 It is undisputed that this class action satisfied the Little Tucker\n\nAct’s amount-in-controversy limitation. We have held that to require\nonly that the “claims of individual members of the clas[s] do not exceed\n$10,000.” United States v. Will, 449 U. S. 200, 211, n. 10 (1980).\n   2 Whereas the Little Tucker Act creates jurisdiction in the district\n\ncourts concurrent with the Court of Federal Claims for covered claims\nof $10,000 or less, the Tucker Act assigns jurisdiction to the Court of\nFederal Claims regardless of monetary amount. As relevant here, the\nscope of the two statutes is otherwise the same. The third statute in\nthe Tucker Act trio, the Indian Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. §1505, “confers a\nlike waiver for Indian tribal claims that ‘otherwise would be cognizable\nin the Court of Federal Claims if the claimant were not an Indian\ntribe.’ ” United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465,\n472 (2003) (quoting §1505).\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

S. 287,\n290 (2009).\n  Bormes argues that whether or not FCRA itself unam-\nbiguously waives sovereign immunity, the Little Tucker Act\nauthorizes his FCRA damages claim against the United\nStates. The question, then, is whether a damages claim\nunder FCRA “falls within the terms of the Tucker Act,” so\nthat “the United States has presumptively consented to\nsuit.” Mitchell II, supra, at 216. It does not. Where, as in\nFCRA, a statute contains its own self-executing remedial\nscheme, we look only to that statute to determine whether\nCongress intended to subject the United States to dam-\nages liability.\n                                A\n  The Court of Claims was established, and the Tucker\nAct enacted, to open a judicial avenue for certain mone-\ntary claims against the United States. Before the creation\nof the Court of Claims in 1855, see Act of Feb. 24, 1855\n(1855 Act), ch. 122, §1, 10 Stat. 612, it was not uncommon\nfor statutes to impose monetary obligations on the United\nStates without specifying a means of judicial enforce-\nment.3 As a result, claimants routinely petitioned Con-\ngress for private bills to recover money owed by the Federal\nGovernment. See Mitchell II, supra, at 212 (citing P.\nBator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro & H. Wechsler, Hart and\n——————\n  3 For example, the Act of March 30, 1814, provided that every non-\n\ncommissioned U. S. army officer who “may be captured by the enemy,\nshall be entitled to receive during his captivity . . . the same pay,\nsubsistence, and allowance to which he may be entitled whilst in the\nactual service of the United States.” §14, 3 Stat. 115, repealed in 1962\nby Pub. L. 87–649, §14, 76 Stat. 498. The 1814 Act clearly “com-\nmand[ed] the payment of a specified amount of money by the United\nStates,” Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879, 923 (1988) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting), but did not designate a means of judicial relief in the event\nthe Government failed to pay.\n6                   UNITED STATES v. BORMES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nWechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 98\n(2d ed. 1973)). As this individualized legislative process\nbecame increasingly burdensome for Congress, the Court\nof Claims was created “to relieve the pressure on Congress\ncaused by the volume of private bills.” Glidden Co. v.\nZdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 552 (1962) (plurality opinion). The\n1855 Act authorized the Court of Claims to hear claims\nagainst the United States “founded upon any law of Con-\ngress,” §1, 10 Stat. 612, and thus allowed claimants to\nsue the Federal Government for monetary relief premised\non other sources of law. (Specialized legislation remained\nnecessary to authorize the payments approved by the\nCourt of Claims until 1863, when Congress empowered the\ncourt to enter final judgments. See Act of Mar. 3, 1863\n(1863 Act), ch. 92, 12 Stat. 765; Mitchell II, supra, at 212–\n214 (recounting the history of the Court of Claims)).\n   Enacted in 1887, the Tucker Act was the successor\nstatute to the 1855 and 1863 Acts and replaced most of\ntheir provisions. See Act of Mar. 3, 1887 (1887 Act), ch.\n359, 24 Stat. 505; Mitchell II, supra, at 213–214. Like the\n1855 Act before it, the Tucker Act provided the Federal\nGovernment’s consent to suit in the Court of Claims for\nclaims “founded upon . . . any law of Congress.” 1887 Act\n§1, 24 Stat. 505. Section 2 of the 1887 Act created concur-\nrent jurisdiction in the district courts for claims of up to\n$1,000. The Tucker Act’s jurisdictional grant, and accom-\npanying immunity waiver, supplied the missing ingredient\nfor an action against the United States for the breach of\nmonetary obligations not otherwise judicially enforceable.4\n——————\n   4 For purposes of this case, the current versions of the Tucker Act and\n\nLittle Tucker Act resemble the 1887 Act. Compare 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1)\n(permitting suits “founded . . . upon . . . any Act of Congress”) with\nTucker Act §1, 24 Stat. 505 (permitting suits “founded upon . . . any law\nof Congress, except for pensions”). The prior functions of the Court of\nClaims are now divided between the Court of Federal Claims at the\ntrial level and the Federal Circuit at the appellate.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               B\n\n  The Tucker Act is displaced, however, when a law as-\nsertedly imposing monetary liability on the United States\ncontains its own judicial remedies. In that event, the\nspecific remedial scheme establishes the exclusive frame-\nwork for the liability Congress created under the statute.\nBecause a “precisely drawn, detailed statute pre-empts\nmore general remedies,” Hinck v. United States, 550 U. S.\n501, 506 (2007) (quoting EC Term of Years Trust v. United\nStates, 550 U. S. 429, 434 (2007); internal quotation marks\nomitted), FCRA’s self-executing remedial scheme super-\nsedes the gap-filling role of the Tucker Act.\n  We have long recognized that an additional remedy in\nthe Court of Claims is foreclosed when it contradicts the\nlimits of a precise remedial scheme. In Nichols v. United\nStates, 7 Wall. 122, 131 (1869), the issue was whether the\n1855 Act authorized suit in the Court of Claims for im-\nproper assessment of duties on imported liquor that had\nalready been paid without protest. The Court held that it\ndid not. The revenue laws already provided a remedy: An\naggrieved merchant could sue to recover the tax, but only\nafter paying the duty under protest. Act of Feb. 26, 1845,\nch. 22, 5 Stat. 727. The Court rejected the supposition\nthat “Congress, after having carefully constructed a reve-\nnue system, with ample provisions to redress wrong,\nintended to give to the taxpayer and importer a further\nand different remedy.” 7 Wall., at 131. Permitting suit\nunder the 1855 Act, the Court concluded, would frustrate\ncongressional intent with respect to the specific remedial\nscheme already in place. The 1855 Act was confined to a\ngap-filling role. As we said in a later case, “the general\nlaws which govern the Court of Claims may be resorted\nto for relief ” only because “[n]o special remedy has been\nprovided” to enforce a payment to which the claimant was\nentitled. United States v. Kaufman, 96 U. S. 567, 569\n(1878). Where the “liability is one created by statute,” the\n8                   UNITED STATES v. BORMES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n“special remedy provided by the same statute is exclusive.”\nIbid.\n   Our more recent cases have consistently held that statu-\ntory schemes with their own remedial framework exclude\nalternative relief under the general terms of the Tucker\nAct. See, e.g., Hinck, supra; United States v. Fausto, 484\nU. S. 439 (1988); United States v. Erika, Inc., 456 U. S.\n201 (1982). Respondent contends that in each of those\ncases Congress had unambiguously demonstrated its\nintent to foreclose additional review by the Court of Fed-\neral Claims—whereas here, no similar intent to preclude\nTucker Act jurisdiction is apparent. See Brief for Re-\nspondent 27–28. But our precedents collectively stand for\na more basic proposition: Where a specific statutory\nscheme provides the accoutrements of a judicial action, the\nmetes and bounds of the liability Congress intended to\ncreate can only be divined from the text of the statute\nitself.5\n   In Hinck, for example, we held that the Tax Court pro-\nvides the exclusive forum for suits under 26 U. S. C.\n§6404(h), which authorizes judicial review of the Secre-\ntary’s decision not to abate interest under §6404(e)(1). We\nrelied on “our past recognition that when Congress enacts\na specific remedy when no remedy was previously recog-\nnized . . . the remedy provided is generally regarded as\n——————\n   5 We therefore need not resolve the parties’ disagreement about\n\nwhether certain inconsistencies between the Little Tucker Act and\nFCRA can be reconciled. Compare 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2) (no claims in\ndistrict court “exceeding $10,000 in amount”) with 15 U. S. C. §1681p\n(claims may be brought in district court “without regard to the amount\nin controversy”); compare 28 U. S. C. §2501 (claims must be filed in the\nCourt of Federal Claims within six years of accrual) with 15 U. S. C.\n§1681p (claims under FCRA must be filed within the earlier of two\nyears after discovery or five years after the alleged violation). Recon-\ncilable or not, FCRA governs. The Government also contends that the\nTucker Act does not apply because §§1681n and 1681o sound in tort.\nWe do not decide the merits of that alternative argument.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexclusive.” 550 U. S., at 506. Section 6404(h), we con-\ncluded, “fits the bill”: it “provides a forum for adjudication,\na limited class of potential plaintiffs, a statute of limita-\ntions, a standard of review, and authorization for judicial\nrelief.” Ibid. It did not matter that Congress “fail[ed]\nexplicitly to define the Tax Court’s jurisdiction as exclu-\nsive.” Ibid. We found it “quite plain that the terms of\n§6404(h)—a ‘precisely drawn, detailed statute’ filling a\nperceived hole in the law—control all requests for review\nof §6404(e)(1) determinations.” Ibid.\n   Like §6404(h), FCRA creates a detailed remedial\nscheme. Its provisions “set out a carefully circumscribed,\ntime-limited, plaintiff-specific” cause of action, and “also\nprecisely define the appropriate forum.” Id., at 507. It\nauthorizes aggrieved consumers to hold “any person” who\n“willfully” or “negligent[ly]” fails to comply with the Act’s\nrequirements liable for specified damages. 15 U. S. C.\n§§1681n(a), 1681o. Claims to enforce liability must be\nbrought within a specified limitations period, §1681p, and\njurisdiction will lie “in any appropriate United States dis-\ntrict court, without regard to the amount in controversy,\nor in any other court of competent jurisdiction.” Ibid.\nWithout resort to the Tucker Act, FCRA enables claimants\nto pursue in court the monetary relief contemplated by the\nstatute.\n   Plaintiffs cannot, therefore, mix and match FCRA’s\nprovisions with the Little Tucker Act’s immunity waiver to\ncreate an action against the United States. Since FCRA\nis a detailed remedial scheme, only its own text can de-\ntermine whether the damages liability Congress crafted\nextends to the Federal Government. To hold otherwise—\nto permit plaintiffs to remedy the absence of a waiver of\nsovereign immunity in specific, detailed statutes by plead-\ning general Tucker Act jurisdiction—would transform the\nsovereign-immunity landscape.\n   The Federal Circuit was therefore wrong to conclude\n10               UNITED STATES v. BORMES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the Tucker Act justified applying a “less stringent”\nsovereign-immunity analysis to FCRA than our cases\nrequire. 626 F. 3d, at 582. It distorted our case law in\napplying to FCRA the immunity-waiver standard we\nexpressed in White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S., at\n472: whether the statute “ ‘can fairly be interpreted as\nmandating compensation by the Federal Government for\nthe damage sustained.’ ” 626 F. 3d, at 578. That is the\ntest for determining whether a statute that imposes an\nobligation but does not provide the elements of a cause of\naction qualifies for suit under the Tucker Act—more spe-\ncifically, whether the failure to perform an obligation\nundoubtedly imposed on the Federal Government creates\na right to monetary relief. See White Mountain Apache\nTribe, supra; Mitchell II, 463 U. S. 206. That test is not\nrelevant when a “mandate of compensation” is contained\nin a statute that provides a detailed judicial remedy\nagainst those who are subject to its requirements. FCRA\nis such a statute. By using the “fair interpretation” test to\ndetermine whether FCRA’s civil liability provisions apply\nto the United States, the Federal Circuit directed the test\nto a purpose for which it was not designed and leapfrogged\nthe threshold concern that the Tucker Act cannot be su-\nperimposed on an existing remedial scheme.\n                         *   *    *\n  We do not decide here whether FCRA itself waives the\nFederal Government’s immunity to damages actions under\n§1681n. That question is for the Seventh Circuit to con-\nsider once this case is transferred to it on remand. But\nwhether or not FCRA contains the necessary waiver of\nimmunity, any attempt to append a Tucker Act remedy to\nthe statute’s existing remedial scheme interferes with its\nintended scope of liability.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and\nthe case remanded with instructions to transfer the case to\n                 Cite as: 568 U.
