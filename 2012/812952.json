In advance of the pen-\nalty phase of his trial, Hodge’s counsel conducted no inves-\ntigation into potential mitigation evidence and presented\nno evidence to the jury. The Commonwealth did not put on\nevidence of aggravating circumstances either, beyond the\nfacts of the crime. Instead, the parties agreed that the\njury should be read this stipulation: “ ‘Benny Lee Hodge\nhas a loving and supportive family—a wife and three\nchildren.

The Commonwealth did not\ncontest Hodge’s evidence, although it did not concede that\nall the evidence would have been available or admissible\nat the time of trial.

Hodge’s father battered\nhis mother while she carried Hodge in her womb, and con-\ntinued to beat her once Hodge was born, even while she\nheld the infant in her arms. When Hodge was a few years\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

His mother next married Billy Joe. Family\nmembers described Billy Joe as a “ ‘monster.’ ” Id., at 7.\nBilly Joe controlled what little money the family had,\nleaving them to live in abject poverty. He beat Hodge’s\nmother relentlessly, once so severely that she had a mis-\ncarriage. He raped her regularly. And he threatened to\nkill her while pointing a gun at her. All of this abuse\noccurred while Hodge and his sisters could see or hear.\nAnd following many beatings, Hodge and his sisters\nthought their mother was dead.\n  Billy Joe also targeted Hodge’s sisters, molesting at\nleast one of them. But according to neighbors and family\nmembers, as the only male in the house, Hodge bore the\nbrunt of Billy Joe’s anger, especially when he tried to\ndefend his mother and sisters from attack. Billy Joe of-\nten beat Hodge with a belt, sometimes leaving imprints\nfrom his belt buckle on Hodge’s body. Hodge was kicked,\nthrown against walls, and punched. Billy Joe once made\nHodge watch while he brutally killed Hodge’s dog. On\nanother occasion, Billy Joe rubbed Hodge’s nose in his own\nfeces.\n  The abuse took its toll on Hodge. He had been an aver-\nage student in school, but he began to change when Billy\nJoe entered his life. He started stealing around age 12,\nand wound up in juvenile detention for his crimes. There,\nHodge was beaten routinely and subjected to frequent\nverbal and emotional abuse. After assaulting Billy Joe\nat age 16, Hodge returned to juvenile detention, where\nthe abuse continued. Hodge remained there until he\nwas 18. Over the 16 years between his release from juve-\nnile detention and the murder, Hodge committed various\ntheft crimes that landed him in prison for about 13 of\nthose years. He twice escaped, but each time, he was\nrecaptured.\n4                   HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Psychologists who testified at Hodge’s evidentiary hear-\ning, and were credited by the court below, explained that\nthe degree of domestic violence Hodge suffered was ex-\ntremely damaging to his development. The environment\ncaused “ ‘hypervigilance’ ”—a state of constant anxiety that\nleft Hodge always “ ‘waiting for the next shoe to fall.’ ” Pet.\nfor Cert. 7. It taught him “ ‘that the world was a hos-\ntile place and that he was not going to be able to count\non anybody else to protect him’ ”—not his family and not\nsociety. Id., at 8. Being taken to a juvenile facility only to\nbe beaten more likely hit Hodge as a “ ‘double betrayal.’ ”\nId., at 9. The result was that Hodge had posttraumatic\nstress disorder. Unable to control his behavior and his\nemotions because of PTSD, he turned to drugs and alcohol\nto numb his feelings. This condition could have been\ndiagnosed at the time of his trial.\n   The Commonwealth conceded that counsel was deficient\nfor failing to gather and present this evidence at the pen-\nalty phase of Hodge’s trial. But it contended that Hodge\nwould have been sentenced to death even if the evidence\nhad been presented. Examining the evidence, the Ken-\ntucky Supreme Court had “no doubt that Hodge, as a\nchild, suffered a most severe and unimaginable level of\nphysical and mental abuse.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. Yet\nit felt “compelled to reach the conclusion that there exists\nno reasonable probability that the jury would not have\nsentenced Hodge to death” anyway. Ibid.\n   The Court based its conclusion in part on the aggra-\nvating circumstances against which the jury would have\nhad to weigh the mitigation evidence. The murder itself\nwas “calculated and exceedingly cold-hearted.” Id., at 9.\nHodge stabbed the daughter “at least ten times,” and he\n“coolly” told his codefendant that he knew the daughter\n“was dead because the knife had gone ‘all the way through\nher to the floor.’ ” Id., at 10. Hodge’s conduct after the\nmurder was shocking as well: He and the two other rob-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nbers “brazenly spent the stolen money on a lavish lifestyle\nand luxury goods, including a Corvette,” and Hodge told a\ncellmate he had “sprea[d] all the money out on a bed and\nha[d] sex with his girlfriend on top of it.” Ibid. Moreover,\nhad Hodge put on evidence in mitigation, the Common-\nwealth may have sought to introduce evidence of Hodge’s\n“long and increasingly violent criminal history, his numer-\nous escapes from custody, and the obvious failure of sev-\neral rehabilitative efforts.” Id., at 9.\n   The court’s conclusion was also based, however, on what\neffect the mitigation evidence might have had:\n    “Perhaps this information may have offered insight\n    for the jury, providing some explanation for the career\n    criminal he later became. If it had been admitted, the\n    PTSD diagnosis offered in mitigation might have ex-\n    plained Hodge’s substance abuse, or perhaps even a\n    crime committed in a fit of rage as a compulsive re-\n    action. But it offers virtually no rationale for the\n    premeditated, cold-blooded murder and attempted\n    murder of two innocent victims who were complete\n    strangers to Hodge. Many, if not most, malefactors\n    committing terribly violent and cruel murders are the\n    subjects of terrible childhoods. Even if the sentencing\n    jury had this mitigation evidence before it, we do not\n    believe, in light of the particularly depraved and bru-\n    tal nature of these crimes, that it would have spared\n    Hodge the death penalty.” Id., at 11.\nAccordingly, the court denied Hodge relief.\n                             II\n  The Sixth Amendment guarantees capital defendants\nthe effective assistance of counsel during the penalty\nphase of trial. This right includes counsel’s “obligation to\nconduct a thorough investigation of the defendant’s back-\nground,” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 396 (2000), so\n6                       HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nas “to uncover and present . . . mitigating evidence” to\nthe jury at sentencing. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510,\n522 (2003). It is uncontested that trial counsel failed to\ndischarge that duty here. But to establish a Sixth\nAmendment violation, Hodge must also demonstrate that\ncounsel’s failures prejudiced his defense. In Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), we explained that a\n“defendant must show that there is a reasonable probabil-\nity that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result\nof the proceeding would have been different.” Id., at 694.\nIn the capital sentencing context, to assess prejudice, “we\nreweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of\navailable mitigating evidence.” Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 534;\nsee also Sears v. Upton, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (per\ncuriam) (slip op., at 10–11); Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S.\n30, 41 (2009) (per curiam); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S.\n374, 393 (2005). The critical question is whether “there is\na reasonable probability that at least one juror would have\nstruck a different balance” in weighing the evidence for\nand against sentencing the defendant to death. Wiggins,\n539 U. S., at 537.*\n   In applying this standard, the Kentucky Supreme Court\nproperly took account of the possible evidence in aggrava-\ntion. But in discounting the countervailing effect of\nHodge’s proposed mitigation, the court misunderstood the\npurpose of mitigation evidence. The court reasoned that\nHodge’s mitigation evidence might have altered the jury’s\nrecommendation only if it “explained” or provided some\n——————\n    * At\n       the time Hodge was sentenced, Kentucky required jury unanim-\nity to recommend a sentence of death. Cf. Carson v. Commonwealth,\n382 S. W. 2d 85, 95 (Ky. App. 1964); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §532.025\n(Michie 1985). The trial court was responsible for the ultimate sentenc-\ning determination, but the jury’s recommendation was to “carr[y] great\nweight” in that decision. Gall v. Commonwealth, 607 S. W. 2d 97, 104\n(Ky. 1980). See also Porter, 558 U. S., at 40, 42 (applying Wiggins to an\n“advisory jury”).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n“rationale” for his conduct. App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. We\nhave made clear for over 30 years, however, that mitiga-\ntion does not play so limited a role. In Lockett v. Ohio, 438\nU. S. 586 (1978), we held that the sentencer in a capital\ncase must be given a full opportunity to consider, as a\nmitigating factor, “any aspect of a defendant’s character\nor record,” in addition to “any of the circumstances of\nthe offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sen-\ntence less than death.” Id., at 604 (plurality opinion)\n(emphasis added). We emphasized the “need for treating\neach defendant in a capital case with that degree of re-\nspect due the uniqueness of the individual.” Id., at 605.\nThis rule “recognizes that ‘justice . . . requires . . . that\nthere be taken into account the circumstances of the of-\nfense together with the character and propensities of the\noffender,’ ” as part of deciding whether the defendant is\nto live or die. Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 112\n(1982) (quoting Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe, 302\nU. S. 51, 55 (1937)). And it ensures that “ ‘the sentence\nimposed at the penalty stage . . . reflect[s] a reasoned\nmoral response to the defendant’s background, character,\nand crime.’ ” Abdul-Kabir v. Quarterman, 550 U. S. 233,\n252 (2007) (quoting California v. Brown, 479 U. S. 538,\n545 (1987) (O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n   Thus we have consistently rejected States’ attempts to\nlimit as irrelevant evidence of a defendant’s background or\ncharacter that he wishes to offer in mitigation. In Skipper\nv. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), for example, we held\nthat the exclusion of evidence regarding the defendant’s\ngood behavior in jail while awaiting trial deprived him of\n“his right to place before the sentencer relevant evidence\nin mitigation of punishment.” Id., at 4. We explained that\nthe jury “could have drawn favorable inferences . . . re-\ngarding [the defendant’s] character and his probable\nfuture conduct.” Ibid. Although “any such inferences\nwould not relate specifically to [the defendant’s] culpabil-\n8                   HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nity for the crime he committed, . . . such inferences would\nbe ‘mitigating’ in the sense that they might serve ‘as a\nbasis for a sentence less than death.’ ” Id., at 4–5 (quoting\nLockett, 438 U. S., at 604 (plurality opinion)).\n   Particularly instructive is Smith v. Texas, 543 U. S. 37\n(2004) (per curiam). In Smith, the Texas courts withheld\na mitigation instruction concerning the defendant’s back-\nground, on the ground that he had offered “no evidence of\nany link or nexus between his troubled childhood or his\nlimited mental abilities and this capital murder.” Ex parte\nSmith, 132 S. W. 3d 407, 414 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). We\nrejected this “nexus” requirement as one we had “never\ncountenanced,” and we reiterated that the only relevant\nquestion is whether the proposed mitigation evidence\nwould give a jury “a reason to impose a sentence more\nlenient than death.” 543 U. S., at 44–45.\n   The Kentucky Supreme Court’s opinion is plainly con-\ntrary to these precedents. The evidence of Hodge’s brutal\nupbringing need not have offered any “rationale” for the\nmurder he committed in order for the jury to have consid-\nered it as weighty mitigation. It would be enough if there\nwere a “reasonable probability” that, because of Hodge’s\ntragic past, the jury’s “reasoned moral response” would\ninstead have been to spare his life and sentence him to life\nimprisonment instead.\n   More fundamentally, the Kentucky Supreme Court\nappears to believe that in cases involving “violent and\ncruel murders,” it does not matter that the “malefacto[r]”\nhad a “terrible childhoo[d]”; the jury would return a death\nsentence regardless. App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. That view\nis contrary to our cases applying Strickland’s prejudice\nprong. In Rompilla, for example, we considered counsel’s\nfailure “to present significant mitigating evidence about\nRompilla’s childhood,” which was as horrific as Hodge’s, as\nwell as his “mental capacity and health, and alcoholism.”\n545 U. S., at 378; see id., at 391–392 (describing the abuse\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nin Rompilla’s household while he was young). We con-\ncluded that “the undiscovered mitigating evidence, taken\nas a whole, might well have influenced the jury’s appraisal\nof Rompilla’s culpability, and the likelihood of a different\nresult if the evidence had gone in is sufficient to under-\nmine confidence in the outcome actually reached at sen-\ntencing.” Id., at 393 (internal quotation marks, citations,\nand brackets omitted). We reached this conclusion not-\nwithstanding that Rompilla had been convicted of stab-\nbing a man repeatedly and setting him on fire. Id., at 377.\nSimilarly, we found prejudice in Wiggins even though the\ndefendant had drowned a 77-year-old woman in her bath-\ntub. 539 U. S., at 514. The evidence of “severe physical\nand sexual abuse” Wiggins suffered as a child was suffi-\nciently “powerful” that “[h]ad the jury been able to place\n[Wiggins’] excruciating life history on the mitigating side\nof the scale, there [was] a reasonable probability that at\nleast one juror would have struck a different balance.” Id.,\nat 516, 534, 537.\n   The Kentucky Supreme Court’s brief discussion of the\nweight and impact of Hodge’s mitigation evidence reason-\nably suggests that its prejudice determination flowed from\nits legal errors. Perhaps if the court had afforded proper\nconsideration to the mitigation evidence, it still would\nhave reached the same result; it might have found no\n“reasonable probability” that the jury would have weighed\nHodge’s difficult past more heavily in its moral calculation\nthan the callous nature of the crime and Hodge’s history\nof imprisonment and escape. But, giving full effect to the\nmitigation evidence, the court may well have concluded\nthat the story of Hodge’s childhood was so extraordinary,\n“there is a reasonable probability that at least one ju-\nror would have struck a different balance” had the jury\nknown. Id., at 537; see also Porter, 558 U. S., at 42. A\n“reasonable probability” is only “a probability sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome.” Strickland, 466\n10                 HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 694. Absent its errors, the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt may have found that minimal threshold met on\nthese facts.\n  We are a reviewing court, so I would leave it to the\nKentucky Supreme Court to reweigh the evidence under\nthe proper standards in the first instance. But this is a\ncapital case, and clear errors of law such as those here\nshould be redressed. I respectfully dissent from our fail-\nure to grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judg-\nment below, and remand for further consideration.\n</pre>", "id": 812952, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/12/03/hodge_v._kentucky.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 568 U.

KENTUCKY\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Psychologists who testified at Hodge’s evidentiary hear-\ning, and were credited by the court below, explained that\nthe degree of domestic violence Hodge suffered was ex-\ntremely damaging to his development. The environment\ncaused “ ‘hypervigilance’ ”—a state of constant anxiety that\nleft Hodge always “ ‘waiting for the next shoe to fall.’ ” Pet.\nfor Cert. 7. It taught him “ ‘that the world was a hos-\ntile place and that he was not going to be able to count\non anybody else to protect him’ ”—not his family and not\nsociety. Id., at 8. Being taken to a juvenile facility only to\nbe beaten more likely hit Hodge as a “ ‘double betrayal.’ ”\nId., at 9. The result was that Hodge had posttraumatic\nstress disorder. Unable to control his behavior and his\nemotions because of PTSD, he turned to drugs and alcohol\nto numb his feelings. This condition could have been\ndiagnosed at the time of his trial.\n   The Commonwealth conceded that counsel was deficient\nfor failing to gather and present this evidence at the pen-\nalty phase of Hodge’s trial. But it contended that Hodge\nwould have been sentenced to death even if the evidence\nhad been presented. Examining the evidence, the Ken-\ntucky Supreme Court had “no doubt that Hodge, as a\nchild, suffered a most severe and unimaginable level of\nphysical and mental abuse.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. Yet\nit felt “compelled to reach the conclusion that there exists\nno reasonable probability that the jury would not have\nsentenced Hodge to death” anyway. Ibid.\n   The Court based its conclusion in part on the aggra-\nvating circumstances against which the jury would have\nhad to weigh the mitigation evidence. The murder itself\nwas “calculated and exceedingly cold-hearted.” Id., at 9.\nHodge stabbed the daughter “at least ten times,” and he\n“coolly” told his codefendant that he knew the daughter\n“was dead because the knife had gone ‘all the way through\nher to the floor.’ ” Id., at 10. Hodge’s conduct after the\nmurder was shocking as well: He and the two other rob-\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Moreover,\nhad Hodge put on evidence in mitigation, the Common-\nwealth may have sought to introduce evidence of Hodge’s\n“long and increasingly violent criminal history, his numer-\nous escapes from custody, and the obvious failure of sev-\neral rehabilitative efforts.” Id., at 9.\n   The court’s conclusion was also based, however, on what\neffect the mitigation evidence might have had:\n    “Perhaps this information may have offered insight\n    for the jury, providing some explanation for the career\n    criminal he later became. If it had been admitted, the\n    PTSD diagnosis offered in mitigation might have ex-\n    plained Hodge’s substance abuse, or perhaps even a\n    crime committed in a fit of rage as a compulsive re-\n    action. But it offers virtually no rationale for the\n    premeditated, cold-blooded murder and attempted\n    murder of two innocent victims who were complete\n    strangers to Hodge. Many, if not most, malefactors\n    committing terribly violent and cruel murders are the\n    subjects of terrible childhoods. Even if the sentencing\n    jury had this mitigation evidence before it, we do not\n    believe, in light of the particularly depraved and bru-\n    tal nature of these crimes, that it would have spared\n    Hodge the death penalty.” Id., at 11.\nAccordingly, the court denied Hodge relief.\n                             II\n  The Sixth Amendment guarantees capital defendants\nthe effective assistance of counsel during the penalty\nphase of trial. This right includes counsel’s “obligation to\nconduct a thorough investigation of the defendant’s back-\nground,” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 396 (2000), so\n6                       HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nas “to uncover and present . . . mitigating evidence” to\nthe jury at sentencing. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510,\n522 (2003). It is uncontested that trial counsel failed to\ndischarge that duty here. But to establish a Sixth\nAmendment violation, Hodge must also demonstrate that\ncounsel’s failures prejudiced his defense. In Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), we explained that a\n“defendant must show that there is a reasonable probabil-\nity that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result\nof the proceeding would have been different.” Id., at 694.\nIn the capital sentencing context, to assess prejudice, “we\nreweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of\navailable mitigating evidence.” Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 534;\nsee also Sears v. Upton, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (per\ncuriam) (slip op., at 10–11); Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S.\n30, 41 (2009) (per curiam); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S.\n374, 393 (2005). The critical question is whether “there is\na reasonable probability that at least one juror would have\nstruck a different balance” in weighing the evidence for\nand against sentencing the defendant to death. Wiggins,\n539 U. S., at 537.*\n   In applying this standard, the Kentucky Supreme Court\nproperly took account of the possible evidence in aggrava-\ntion. But in discounting the countervailing effect of\nHodge’s proposed mitigation, the court misunderstood the\npurpose of mitigation evidence. The court reasoned that\nHodge’s mitigation evidence might have altered the jury’s\nrecommendation only if it “explained” or provided some\n——————\n    * At\n       the time Hodge was sentenced, Kentucky required jury unanim-\nity to recommend a sentence of death. Cf. Carson v. Commonwealth,\n382 S. W. 2d 85, 95 (Ky. App. 1964); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §532.025\n(Michie 1985). The trial court was responsible for the ultimate sentenc-\ning determination, but the jury’s recommendation was to “carr[y] great\nweight” in that decision. Gall v. Commonwealth, 607 S. W. 2d 97, 104\n(Ky. 1980). See also Porter, 558 U. S., at 40, 42 (applying Wiggins to an\n“advisory jury”).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n“rationale” for his conduct. App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. We\nhave made clear for over 30 years, however, that mitiga-\ntion does not play so limited a role. In Lockett v. Ohio, 438\nU. S. 586 (1978), we held that the sentencer in a capital\ncase must be given a full opportunity to consider, as a\nmitigating factor, “any aspect of a defendant’s character\nor record,” in addition to “any of the circumstances of\nthe offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sen-\ntence less than death.” Id., at 604 (plurality opinion)\n(emphasis added). We emphasized the “need for treating\neach defendant in a capital case with that degree of re-\nspect due the uniqueness of the individual.” Id., at 605.\nThis rule “recognizes that ‘justice . . . requires . . . that\nthere be taken into account the circumstances of the of-\nfense together with the character and propensities of the\noffender,’ ” as part of deciding whether the defendant is\nto live or die. Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 112\n(1982) (quoting Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe, 302\nU. S. 51, 55 (1937)). And it ensures that “ ‘the sentence\nimposed at the penalty stage . . . reflect[s] a reasoned\nmoral response to the defendant’s background, character,\nand crime.’ ” Abdul-Kabir v. Quarterman, 550 U. S. 233,\n252 (2007) (quoting California v. Brown, 479 U. S. 538,\n545 (1987) (O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n   Thus we have consistently rejected States’ attempts to\nlimit as irrelevant evidence of a defendant’s background or\ncharacter that he wishes to offer in mitigation. In Skipper\nv. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), for example, we held\nthat the exclusion of evidence regarding the defendant’s\ngood behavior in jail while awaiting trial deprived him of\n“his right to place before the sentencer relevant evidence\nin mitigation of punishment.” Id., at 4. We explained that\nthe jury “could have drawn favorable inferences . . . re-\ngarding [the defendant’s] character and his probable\nfuture conduct.” Ibid. Although “any such inferences\nwould not relate specifically to [the defendant’s] culpabil-\n8                   HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nity for the crime he committed, . . . such inferences would\nbe ‘mitigating’ in the sense that they might serve ‘as a\nbasis for a sentence less than death.’ ” Id., at 4–5 (quoting\nLockett, 438 U. S., at 604 (plurality opinion)).\n   Particularly instructive is Smith v. Texas, 543 U. S. 37\n(2004) (per curiam). In Smith, the Texas courts withheld\na mitigation instruction concerning the defendant’s back-\nground, on the ground that he had offered “no evidence of\nany link or nexus between his troubled childhood or his\nlimited mental abilities and this capital murder.” Ex parte\nSmith, 132 S. W. 3d 407, 414 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). We\nrejected this “nexus” requirement as one we had “never\ncountenanced,” and we reiterated that the only relevant\nquestion is whether the proposed mitigation evidence\nwould give a jury “a reason to impose a sentence more\nlenient than death.” 543 U. S., at 44–45.\n   The Kentucky Supreme Court’s opinion is plainly con-\ntrary to these precedents. The evidence of Hodge’s brutal\nupbringing need not have offered any “rationale” for the\nmurder he committed in order for the jury to have consid-\nered it as weighty mitigation. It would be enough if there\nwere a “reasonable probability” that, because of Hodge’s\ntragic past, the jury’s “reasoned moral response” would\ninstead have been to spare his life and sentence him to life\nimprisonment instead.\n   More fundamentally, the Kentucky Supreme Court\nappears to believe that in cases involving “violent and\ncruel murders,” it does not matter that the “malefacto[r]”\nhad a “terrible childhoo[d]”; the jury would return a death\nsentence regardless. App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. That view\nis contrary to our cases applying Strickland’s prejudice\nprong. In Rompilla, for example, we considered counsel’s\nfailure “to present significant mitigating evidence about\nRompilla’s childhood,” which was as horrific as Hodge’s, as\nwell as his “mental capacity and health, and alcoholism.”\n545 U. S., at 378; see id., at 391–392 (describing the abuse\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nin Rompilla’s household while he was young). We con-\ncluded that “the undiscovered mitigating evidence, taken\nas a whole, might well have influenced the jury’s appraisal\nof Rompilla’s culpability, and the likelihood of a different\nresult if the evidence had gone in is sufficient to under-\nmine confidence in the outcome actually reached at sen-\ntencing.” Id., at 393 (internal quotation marks, citations,\nand brackets omitted). We reached this conclusion not-\nwithstanding that Rompilla had been convicted of stab-\nbing a man repeatedly and setting him on fire. Id., at 377.\nSimilarly, we found prejudice in Wiggins even though the\ndefendant had drowned a 77-year-old woman in her bath-\ntub. 539 U. S., at 514. The evidence of “severe physical\nand sexual abuse” Wiggins suffered as a child was suffi-\nciently “powerful” that “[h]ad the jury been able to place\n[Wiggins’] excruciating life history on the mitigating side\nof the scale, there [was] a reasonable probability that at\nleast one juror would have struck a different balance.” Id.,\nat 516, 534, 537.\n   The Kentucky Supreme Court’s brief discussion of the\nweight and impact of Hodge’s mitigation evidence reason-\nably suggests that its prejudice determination flowed from\nits legal errors. Perhaps if the court had afforded proper\nconsideration to the mitigation evidence, it still would\nhave reached the same result; it might have found no\n“reasonable probability” that the jury would have weighed\nHodge’s difficult past more heavily in its moral calculation\nthan the callous nature of the crime and Hodge’s history\nof imprisonment and escape. But, giving full effect to the\nmitigation evidence, the court may well have concluded\nthat the story of Hodge’s childhood was so extraordinary,\n“there is a reasonable probability that at least one ju-\nror would have struck a different balance” had the jury\nknown. Id., at 537; see also Porter, 558 U. S., at 42. A\n“reasonable probability” is only “a probability sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome.” Strickland, 466\n10                 HODGE v.

Absent its errors, the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt may have found that minimal threshold met on\nthese facts.\n  We are a reviewing court, so I would leave it to the\nKentucky Supreme Court to reweigh the evidence under\nthe proper standards in the first instance. But this is a\ncapital case, and clear errors of law such as those here\nshould be redressed. I respectfully dissent from our fail-\nure to grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judg-\nment below, and remand for further consideration.\n", "precedential_status": "Relating-to", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/812952/", "sha1": "e0d460f2029a124b4ee8fbcbbbdd78488bdca93f", "source": "C", "time_retrieved": "2012-12-03T07:32:02"}
