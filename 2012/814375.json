The applicants are two closely held for-profit\ncorporations, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (Hobby Lobby) and\nMardel, Inc. (Mardel), and five family members who indi-\nrectly own and control those corporations. Hobby Lobby is\nan arts and crafts retail chainstore, with more than 13,000\nemployees in over 500 stores nationwide. Mardel is a\nchain of Christian-themed bookstores, with 372 full-time\nemployees in 35 stores. Employees of the two corporations\nand their families receive health insurance from the cor-\nporations’ self-insured group health plans.\n  Under §1001(5) of the Patient Protection and Affordable\nCare Act, 124 Stat. 131, 42 U. S. C. §300gg–13(a), non\ngrandfathered group health plans must cover certain\npreventive health services without cost-sharing, including\nvarious preventive services for women as provided in\nguidelines issued by the Health Resources Services Ad-\nministration (HRSA), a component of the Department of\nHealth and Human Services.

S. C.\n§2000bb et seq. They allege that under the HRSA guide-\nlines, Hobby Lobby and Mardel will be required, contrary\nto the applicants’ religious beliefs, to provide insurance\ncoverage for certain drugs and devices that the applicants\nbelieve can cause abortions. The applicants simultaneously\nfiled a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent\nenforcement of the contraception-coverage requirement,\nwhich is scheduled to take effect with respect to the em-\nployee insurance plans of Hobby Lobby and Mardel on\nJanuary 1, 2013. The District Court for the Western\nDistrict of Oklahoma denied the motion for a preliminary\ninjunction, and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\ndenied the applicants’ motion for an injunction pending\nresolution of the appeal.\n   The only source of authority for this Court to issue an\ninjunction is the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. §1651(a). “We\nhave consistently stated, and our own Rules so require,\nthat such power is to be used sparingly.” Turner Broad-\ncasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 507 U.
