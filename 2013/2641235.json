TITLOW\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12–414.      Argued October 8, 2013—Decided November 5, 2013\nRespondent Titlow and Billie Rogers were arrested for the murder of\n  Billie’s husband. After explaining to respondent that the State’s evi-\n  dence could support a conviction for first-degree murder, respondent’s\n  attorney negotiated a manslaughter plea in exchange for an agree-\n  ment to testify against Billie. Three days before Billie’s trial, re-\n  spondent retained a new attorney, Frederick Toca, who demanded an\n  even lower sentence in exchange for the guilty plea and testimony.\n  The prosecutor rejected the proposal, and respondent withdrew the\n  original plea. Without that testimony, Billie was acquitted. Re-\n  spondent was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder. On\n  direct appeal, respondent argued that Toca provided ineffective assis-\n  tance by advising withdrawal of the plea without taking time to learn\n  the strength of the State’s evidence. The Michigan Court of Appeals\n  rejected the claim, concluding that Toca’s actions were reasonable in\n  light of his client’s protestations of innocence. On federal habeas re-\n  view, the District Court applied the deferential standard of review set\n  forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n  (AEDPA), concluded that the Michigan Court of Appeals’ ruling was\n  reasonable on the law and facts, and denied relief. The Sixth Circuit\n  reversed. It found the factual predicate for the state court’s deci-\n  sion—that the plea withdrawal was based on respondent’s assertion\n  of innocence—an unreasonable interpretation of the factual record,\n  given Toca’s explanation at the withdrawal hearing that the decision\n  to withdraw was made because the State’s original plea offer was\n  higher than the sentencing range provided by the Michigan guide-\n  lines. It also found no evidence in the record that Toca adequately\n  advised respondent of the consequences of withdrawal.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit failed to apply the “doubly deferential” stand-\n2                            BURT v.

Pp. 4–11.\n       (a) AEDPA recognizes the federalism principle that state courts are\n    adequate forums for the vindication of federal statutory and constitu-\n    tional rights. It erects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief\n    for prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state court, re-\n    quiring them to “show that the state court’s ruling . . . was so lacking\n    in justification that there was an error . . . beyond any possibility for\n    fairminded disagreement.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___.\n    Pp. 4–6.\n       (b) Here, the record readily supports the Michigan Court of Ap-\n    peals’ factual finding that Toca advised withdrawal of the guilty plea\n    only after respondent’s proclamation of innocence. The facts that re-\n    spondent passed a polygraph test denying being in the room when\n    Billie’s husband was killed, discussed the case with a jailer who ad-\n    vised against pleading guilty if respondent was indeed innocent, and\n    hired Toca just three days before Billie’s trial at which respondent\n    had agreed to self-incriminate, strongly suggest that respondent had\n    second thoughts about confessing in open court and proclaimed inno-\n    cence to Toca. The only evidence cited by the Sixth Circuit for its\n    contrary conclusion was that Toca’s sole explanation at the with-\n    drawal hearing focused on the fact that the State’s plea offer was\n    substantially higher than that provided by the Michigan guidelines.\n    The Michigan Court of Appeals was well aware of Toca’s representa-\n    tions to the trial court and correctly found nothing inconsistent about\n    a defendant’s asserting innocence on the one hand and refusing to\n    plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied by higher-than-normal\n    punishment on the other. Accepting as true the Michigan Court of\n    Appeals’ factual determination that respondent proclaimed innocence\n    to Toca, the Sixth Circuit’s Strickland analysis cannot be sustained.\n    More troubling is that court’s conclusion that Toca was ineffective be-\n    cause the record contained no evidence that he gave constitutionally\n    adequate advice on whether to withdraw the plea. The Sixth Circuit\n    turned on its head the principle that counsel should be “strongly pre-\n    sumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant\n    decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment,” Strick-\n    land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 690, with the burden to show oth-\n    erwise resting squarely on the defendant, id., at 687. The single fact\n    that Toca failed to retrieve respondent’s file from former counsel be-\n    fore withdrawing the guilty plea cannot overcome Strickland’s strong\n    presumption of effectiveness. In any event, respondent admitted in\n    open court that former counsel had explained the State’s evidence\n    and that it would support a first-degree murder conviction. Toca was\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Toca’s conduct in this\n  litigation was far from exemplary, but a lawyer’s ethical violations do\n  not make the lawyer per se ineffective, and Toca’s questionable con-\n  duct was irrelevant to the narrow issue before the Sixth Circuit.\n  Pp. 6–11.\n680 F. 3d 577, reversed.\n\n   ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

BURT, WARDEN, PETITIONER v. VONLEE\n                NICOLE TITLOW\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [November 5, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   When a state prisoner asks a federal court to set aside a\nsentence due to ineffective assistance of counsel during\nplea bargaining, our cases require that the federal court\nuse a “ ‘doubly deferential’ ” standard of review that gives\nboth the state court and the defense attorney the benefit of\nthe doubt. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 17). In this case, the Sixth Circuit failed to\napply that doubly deferential standard by refusing to\ncredit a state court’s reasonable factual finding and by\nassuming that counsel was ineffective where the record\nwas silent. Because the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), do not\npermit federal judges to so casually second-guess the\ndecisions of their state-court colleagues or defense attor­\nneys, the Sixth Circuit’s decision must be reversed.\n                           I\n  Respondent Titlow and Billie Rogers, respondent’s aunt,\nmurdered Billie’s husband Don by pouring vodka down his\nthroat and smothering him with a pillow. With help from\n2                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattorney Richard Lustig, respondent reached an agree­\nment with state prosecutors to testify against Billie, plead\nguilty to manslaughter, and receive a 7- to 15-year sen­\ntence. As confirmed at a plea hearing, Lustig reviewed the\nState’s evidence with respondent “over a long period of\ntime,” and respondent understood that that evidence could\nsupport a conviction for first-degree murder. App. 43–44.\nThe Michigan trial court approved the plea bargain.\n   Three days before Billie Rogers’ trial was to commence,\nhowever, respondent retained a new lawyer, Frederick\nToca. With Toca’s help, respondent demanded a substan­\ntially lower minimum sentence (three years, instead of\nseven) in exchange for the agreement to plead guilty and\ntestify. When the prosecutor refused to accede to the new\ndemands, respondent withdrew the plea, acknowledging\nin open court the consequences of withdrawal (including\nreinstatement of the first-degree murder charge). Without\nrespondent’s critical testimony, Billie Rogers was acquit­\nted, and later died.\n   Respondent subsequently stood trial. During the course\nof the trial, respondent denied any intent to harm Don\nRogers or any knowledge, at the time respondent covered\nhis mouth or poured vodka down his throat, that Billie\nintended to harm him. Indeed, respondent testified to\nattempting to prevent Billie from harming her husband.\nThe jury, however, elected to believe respondent’s previous\nout-of-court statements, which squarely demonstrated\nparticipation in the killing, and convicted respondent of\nsecond-degree murder. The trial court imposed a 20- to\n40-year term of imprisonment.\n   On direct appeal, respondent argued that Toca advised\nwithdrawal of the guilty plea without taking time to learn\nmore about the case, thereby failing to realize the strength\nof the State’s evidence and providing ineffective assistance\nof counsel. Rejecting that claim, the Michigan Court of\nAppeals found that Toca acted reasonably in light of his\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)              3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclient’s protestations of innocence. That court found that\nrespondent’s decision to hire Toca was “set in motion” by\nrespondent’s “statement to a sheriff ’s deputy that [re­\nspondent] did not commit the offense.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 101a. Applying the standard set forth by our deci­\nsion in Strickland, which requires that defense counsel\nsatisfy “an objective standard of reasonableness,” 466\nU. S., at 688, the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded\nthat “[w]hen a defendant proclaims . . . innocence . . . , it is\nnot objectively unreasonable to recommend that the de­\nfendant refrain from pleading guilty—no matter how\n‘good’ the deal may appear.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 102a.\n   Respondent then filed a federal habeas petition under\n28 U. S. C. §2254. Applying AEDPA’s deferential stand­\nard of review, the District Court concluded that the Michi­\ngan Court of Appeals’ ruling was “completely reasonable\non the law and the facts” and denied relief.

It found that the factual\npredicate for the state court’s decision—that the with­\ndrawal of the plea was based on respondent’s assertion of\ninnocence—was an unreasonable interpretation of the\nfactual record, given Toca’s explanation at the withdrawal\nhearing that “the decision to withdraw Titlow’s plea was\nbased on the fact that the State’s plea offer was substan­\ntially higher than the Michigan guidelines for second­\ndegree murder.” 680 F. 3d 577, 589 (2012). Further\nobserving that “[t]he record in this case contains no evi­\ndence” that Toca fully informed respondent of the possible\nconsequences of withdrawing the guilty plea, the Sixth\nCircuit held that Toca rendered ineffective assistance of\n4                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncounsel that resulted in respondent’s loss of the benefit of\nthe plea bargain. Id., at 589–592. Citing our decision in\nLafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___ (2012), the Sixth Circuit\nremanded this case with instructions that the prosecution\nmust reoffer the original plea agreement to respondent,\nand that the state court should “consul[t]” the plea agree­\nment and “fashion” a remedy for the violation of respond­\nent’s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel during plea bargaining. 680 F. 3d, at 592. Chief\nJudge Batchelder dissented on the grounds that the Mich­\nigan Court of Appeals’ decision was reasonable. Id., at\n593.\n  On remand, the prosecution followed the Sixth Circuit’s\ninstructions and reoffered the plea agreement it had of­\nfered some 10 years before—even though, in light of Billie\nRogers’ acquittal and subsequent death, respondent was\nno longer able to deliver on the promises originally made\nto the prosecution. At the plea hearing, however, re­\nspondent balked, refusing to provide a factual basis for the\nplea which the court could accept. Respondent admitted\nto pouring vodka down Don Rogers’ throat, but denied\nassisting in killing him or knowing that pouring vodka\ndown his throat could lead to his death. As at trial, re­\nspondent testified to attempting to prevent Billie Rogers\nfrom harming her husband. Eventually, after conferring\nwith current counsel (not Toca), respondent admitted to\nplacing Don Rogers in danger by pouring vodka down his\nthroat with the knowledge that his death could result.\nThe trial court took the plea under advisement, where the\nmatter stands at present. We granted certiorari. 568\nU. S. ___ (2013).\n                             II\n  AEDPA instructs that, when a federal habeas petitioner\nchallenges the factual basis for a prior state-court decision\nrejecting a claim, the federal court may overturn the state\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt’s decision only if it was “based on an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence pre-\nsented in the State court proceeding.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2).\nThe prisoner bears the burden of rebutting the state\ncourt’s factual findings “by clear and convincing evidence.”\n§2254(e)(1). We have not defined the precise relationship\nbetween §2254(d)(2) and §2254(e)(1), and we need not do\nso here. See Wood v. Allen, 558 U. S. 290, 293 (2010). For\npresent purposes, it is enough to reiterate “that a state­\ncourt factual determination is not unreasonable merely\nbecause the federal habeas court would have reached a\ndifferent conclusion in the first instance.” Id., at 301.\nAEDPA likewise imposes a highly deferential standard for\nreviewing claims of legal error by the state courts: A writ\nof habeas corpus may issue only if the state court’s deci­\nsion “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable appli­\ncation of, clearly established Federal law, as determined\nby” this Court. §2254(d)(1).\n   AEDPA recognizes a foundational principle of our fed-\neral system: State courts are adequate forums for the vindi-\ncation of federal rights. “[T]he States possess sovereignty\nconcurrent with that of the Federal Government, subject\nonly to limitations imposed by the Supremacy Clause.\nUnder this system of dual sovereignty, we have consist-\nently held that state courts have inherent authority, and\nare thus presumptively competent, to adjudicate claims\narising under the laws of the United States.” Tafflin v.\nLevitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458 (1990). This principle applies to\nclaimed violations of constitutional, as well as statutory,\nrights. See Trainor v. Hernandez, 431 U. S. 434, 443\n(1977). Indeed, “state courts have the solemn responsibil­\nity equally with the federal courts to safeguard constitu­\ntional rights,” and this Court has refused to sanction any\ndecision that would “reflec[t] negatively upon [a] state\ncourt’s ability to do so.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Especially where a case involves such a common\n6                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim as ineffective assistance of counsel under Strick-\nland—a claim state courts have now adjudicated in count­\nless criminal cases for nearly 30 years—“there is no\nintrinsic reason why the fact that a man is a federal judge\nshould make him more competent, or conscientious, or\nlearned . . . than his neighbor in the state courthouse.”\nStone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 494, n. 35 (1976) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  Recognizing the duty and ability of our state-court\ncolleagues to adjudicate claims of constitutional wrong,\nAEDPA erects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief\nfor prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state\ncourt. AEDPA requires “a state prisoner [to] show that\nthe state court’s ruling on the claim being presented in\nfederal court was so lacking in justification that there was\nan error . . . beyond any possibility for fairminded disa­\ngreement.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 13). “If this standard is difficult to\nmeet”—and it is—“that is because it was meant to be.”\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 12). We will not lightly conclude\nthat a State’s criminal justice system has experienced the\n“extreme malfunctio[n]” for which federal habeas relief is\nthe remedy. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n                             III\n  The record readily supports the Michigan Court of Ap­\npeals’ factual finding that Toca advised withdrawal of the\nguilty plea only after respondent’s proclamation of inno­\ncence. Respondent passed a polygraph denying planning\nto kill Don Rogers or being in the room when he died.\nThereafter, according to an affidavit in the record, re­\nspondent discussed the case with a jailer, who advised\nagainst pleading guilty if respondent was not in fact\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

App. 298 (affidavit of William Pierson).1 That\nconversation “set into motion” respondent’s decision to\nretain Toca. Ibid., ¶8. Those facts, together with the\ntiming of Toca’s hiring—on the eve of the trial at which\nrespondent was to self-incriminate—strongly suggest that\nrespondent had second thoughts about confessing in open\ncourt and proclaimed innocence to Toca. That conclusion\nis further bolstered by respondent’s maintenance of inno­\ncence of Don Rogers’ death at trial.\n   Indeed, reading the record in any other way is difficult.\nRespondent’s first lawyer, Lustig, had negotiated a deal\nthat was quite favorable in light of the fact, admitted by\nrespondent in open court, that the State’s evidence could\nsupport a conviction for first-degree murder. This deal\ninvolved a guilty plea to manslaughter and a 7- to 15-year\nsentence—far less than the mandatory sentence of life in\nprison that results from a conviction for first-degree mur­\nder under Michigan law. See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n§750.316 (West Supp. 2013). Yet after a jailer advised\nagainst pleading guilty if respondent was not guilty, some-\nthing caused respondent both to fire Lustig and hire Toca\n(who within a few days withdrew the guilty plea), and\nthen to maintain innocence at trial. If that something was\nnot a desire to assert innocence, it is difficult to imagine\nwhat it was, and respondent does not offer an alternative\ntheory.\n   The only evidence the Sixth Circuit cited for its conclu­\nsion that the plea withdrawal was not based on respond­\nent’s proclamation of innocence was that, when Toca\n——————\n  1 Respondent complains that the state court improperly relied on this\n\naffidavit, but it was respondent who provided the affidavit to the state\ncourt and asked it to rely on the affidavit as part of the ground for\nremanding for an evidentiary hearing. In any event, even if the state\ncourt used the affidavit for a purpose not permitted by state law—a\nproposition we do not endorse—that would not empower a federal court\nto grant habeas relief. See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72 (1991).\n8                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoved to withdraw the guilty plea, he “did not refer to\nTitlow’s claims of innocence,” but instead “explained that\nthe decision to withdraw [the] plea was based on the fact\nthat the State’s plea offer was substantially higher than\nthe Michigan guidelines” for manslaughter. 680 F. 3d, at\n589. The Sixth Circuit believed that this fact “sufficiently\nrebuts the Michigan Court of Appeals’ finding that the\nplea withdrawal was based on Titlow’s assertion of inno­\ncence.” Ibid.\n   But the Michigan Court of Appeals was well aware of\nToca’s representations to the trial court, noting in its\nopinion that respondent “moved to withdraw [the] plea\nbecause the agreed upon sentence exceeded the sentencing\nguidelines range.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a. The Michi­\ngan Court of Appeals, however—unlike the Sixth Circuit—\nalso correctly recognized that there is nothing inconsistent\nabout a defendant’s asserting innocence on the one hand\nand refusing to plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied\nby higher-than-normal punishment on the other. Indeed,\na defendant convinced of his or her own innocence may\nhave a particularly optimistic view of the likelihood of\nacquittal, and therefore be more likely to drive a hard\nbargain with the prosecution before pleading guilty.\nViewing the record as a whole, we conclude that the Sixth\nCircuit improperly set aside a “reasonable state-court\ndeterminatio[n] of fact in favor of its own debatable inter­\npretation of the record.” Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333, 335\n(2006).\n   Accepting as true the Michigan Court of Appeals’ factual\ndetermination that respondent proclaimed innocence to\nToca, the Sixth Circuit’s Strickland analysis cannot be\nsustained. Although a defendant’s proclamation of inno­\ncence does not relieve counsel of his normal responsibili­\nties under Strickland, it may affect the advice counsel\ngives. The Michigan Court of Appeals’ conclusion that\nToca’s advice satisfied Strickland fell within the bounds of\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                  9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nreasonableness under AEDPA, given that respondent was\nclaiming innocence and only days away from offering self­\nincriminating testimony in open court pursuant to a plea\nagreement involving an above-guidelines sentence.2 See\nFlorida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175, 187 (2004) (explaining\nthat the defendant has the “ ‘ultimate authority’ ” to decide\nwhether to accept a plea bargain); Brookhart v. Janis, 384\nU. S. 1, 7–8 (1966) (observing that a lawyer must not\n“override his client’s desire . . . to plead not guilty”). The\nSixth Circuit’s conclusion to the contrary was error.\n  Even more troubling is the Sixth Circuit’s conclusion\nthat Toca was ineffective because the “record in this case\ncontains no evidence that” he gave constitutionally ade­\nquate advice on whether to withdraw the guilty plea. 680\nF. 3d, at 590. We have said that counsel should be\n“strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance\nand made all significant decisions in the exercise of rea­\nsonable professional judgment,” Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n690, and that the burden to “show that counsel’s perfor­\nmance was deficient” rests squarely on the defendant, id.,\nat 687. The Sixth Circuit turned that presumption of\neffectiveness on its head. It should go without saying that\nthe absence of evidence cannot overcome the “strong pre­\nsumption that counsel’s conduct [fell] within the wide\nrange of reasonable professional assistance.” Id., at 689.\nAs Chief Judge Batchelder correctly explained in her\ndissent, “[w]ithout evidence that Toca gave incorrect ad­\nvice or evidence that he failed to give material advice,\nTitlow cannot establish that his performance was defi­\ncient.” 680 F. 3d, at 595.\n  The Sixth Circuit pointed to a single fact in support of\n\n——————\n  2 We  assume, arguendo, as did the Michigan Court of Appeals, that\nToca went beyond facilitating respondent’s withdrawal of the plea and\nadvised withdrawal, although we note that the sole basis in the record\nfor this assertion appears to be respondent’s self-serving testimony.\n10                    BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits conclusion that Toca failed to adequately advise re­\nspondent: his failure to retrieve respondent’s file from\nLustig before withdrawing the guilty plea. Id., at 590.\nBut here, too, the Sixth Circuit deviated from Strickland’s\nstrong presumption of effectiveness. The record does not\nreveal how much Toca was able to glean about respond­\nent’s case from other sources; he may well have obtained\ncopies of the critical materials from prosecutors or the\ncourt. (Indeed, Toca’s statement at the plea withdrawal\nhearing that “[t]here’s a lot of material here” strongly\nsuggests that he did have access to a source of documenta­\ntion other than Lustig’s file. App. 71.)\n   In any event, the same considerations were relevant to\nentering and withdrawing the guilty plea, and respondent\nadmitted in open court when initially pleading guilty that\nLustig had explained the State’s evidence and that this\nevidence would support a conviction for first-degree mur­\nder. Toca was justified in relying on this admission to\nconclude that respondent understood the strength of the\nprosecution’s case and nevertheless wished to withdraw\nthe plea. With respondent having knowingly entered the\nguilty plea, we think any confusion about the strength of\nthe State’s evidence upon withdrawing the plea less than a\nmonth later highly unlikely.\n   Despite our conclusion that there was no factual or legal\njustification for overturning the state court’s decision, we\nrecognize that Toca’s conduct in this litigation was far\nfrom exemplary. He may well have violated the rules of\nprofessional conduct by accepting respondent’s publication\nrights as partial payment for his services, and he waited\nweeks before consulting respondent’s first lawyer about\nthe case. But the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee\nthe right to perfect counsel; it promises only the right to\neffective assistance, and we have held that a lawyer’s\nviolation of ethical norms does not make the lawyer per se\nineffective.

Troubling as Toca’s actions were, they were irrele­\nvant to the narrow question that was before the Sixth\nCircuit: whether the state court reasonably determined\nthat respondent was adequately advised before deciding to\nwithdraw the guilty plea. Because the Michigan Court of\nAppeals’ decision that respondent was so advised is rea­\nsonable and supported by the record, the Sixth Circuit’s\njudgment is reversed.3\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  3 Because we conclude that the Sixth Circuit erred in finding Toca’s\n\nrepresentation constitutionally ineffective, we do not reach the other\nquestions presented by this case, namely, whether respondent ade­\nquately demonstrated prejudice, and whether the Sixth Circuit’s\nremedy is at odds with our decision in Lafler v.

As our opinion notes, she\nbore the burden of overcoming two presumptions: that\nToca performed effectively and that the state court ruled\ncorrectly. She failed to carry this burden. We need not\nsay more, and indeed we do not say more. I therefore join\nthe Court’s opinion in full. I write separately, however, to\nexpress my understanding of our opinion’s limited scope,\nparticularly with respect to two statements that it makes\nabout the adequacy of Toca’s performance.\n   First, we state that “[a]lthough a defendant’s proclama-\ntion of innocence does not relieve counsel of his normal\nresponsibilities under Strickland, it may affect the advice\ncounsel gives.” Ante, at 8. The first part of that statement\nbears emphasis: Regardless of whether a defendant as-\nserts her innocence (or admits her guilt), her counsel must\n“make an independent examination of the facts, circum-\nstances, pleadings and laws involved and then . . . offer his\ninformed opinion as to what plea should be entered.” Von\nMoltke v. Gillies, 332 U. S. 708, 721 (1948) (plurality\nopinion). A defendant possesses “ ‘the ultimate authority’ ”\nto determine her plea. Florida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175,\n2                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n187 (2004). But a lawyer must abide by his client’s deci-\nsion in this respect only after having provided the client\nwith competent and fully informed advice, including an\nanalysis of the risks that the client would face in proceed-\ning to trial. Given our recognition that “a defendant’s\nproclamation of innocence does not relieve counsel of his\nnormal responsibilities,” ante, at 8, our further observa-\ntion that such a proclamation “may affect the advice coun-\nsel gives,” ibid., states only the obvious: that a lawyer’s\nadvice will always reflect the objectives of the representa-\ntion, as determined by the adequately informed client.\n   Second, we state that it was reasonable for the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals to reject respondent’s claim, “given that\nrespondent was claiming innocence and only days away\nfrom offering self-incriminating testimony” at her aunt’s\ntrial. Ante, at 9. This is true in context: Because respond-\nent failed to carry her burden of showing that Toca’s per-\nformance was not adequate, the state court reasonably\nheld that it was. But our statement about the facts of this\ncase does not imply that an attorney performs effectively\nin advising his client to withdraw from a plea whenever\nthe client asserts her innocence and has only a few days to\nmake the decision. Had respondent made a better factual\nrecord—had she actually shown, for example, that Toca\nfailed to educate himself about the case before recom-\nmending that she withdraw her plea—then she could well\nhave prevailed.\n   Because (and only because) respondent failed to present\nenough evidence to overcome the twin presumptions of\nAEDPA and Strickland, I join fully in the opinion of the\nCourt.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

As the Court rightly observes, Toca’s conduct\nwas “far from exemplary.” Ante, at 10. With virtually no\ntime to make an assessment of Titlow’s chances of prevail-\ning at trial, and without consulting the lawyer who had\nnegotiated Titlow’s plea, Toca told Titlow he could take\nthe case to trial and win. App. 295 (Titlow’s uncontra-\ndicted averment). With Toca’s aid, Titlow’s plea was with-\ndrawn just three days after Toca’s retention as defense\ncounsel. At sentencing, the prosecutor volunteered that\nTitlow had been the “victim of some bad advice.” Id., at\n291.\n  Nevertheless, one thing is crystal clear. The prosecu-\ntor’s agreement to the plea bargain hinged entirely on\nTitlow’s willingness to testify at her aunt’s trial. See App.\n42–43, 45. Once Titlow reneged on that half of the deal,\nthe bargain failed. Absent an extant bargain, there was\nnothing to renew. See Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S.\n129, 137 (2009) (“Although the analogy may not hold in\nall respects, plea bargains are essentially contracts. . . .\n2                      BURT v.

In short, the prosecutor could\nnot be ordered to “renew” a plea proposal never offered in\nthe first place. With the plea offer no longer alive, Titlow\nwas convicted after a trial free from reversible error. See\nApp. 295. For these reasons, I join the Court’s judgment.\n</pre>", "id": 2641235, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/11/05/burt_v._titlow.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued October 8, 2013—Decided November 5, 2013\nRespondent Titlow and Billie Rogers were arrested for the murder of\n  Billie’s husband. After explaining to respondent that the State’s evi-\n  dence could support a conviction for first-degree murder, respondent’s\n  attorney negotiated a manslaughter plea in exchange for an agree-\n  ment to testify against Billie. Three days before Billie’s trial, re-\n  spondent retained a new attorney, Frederick Toca, who demanded an\n  even lower sentence in exchange for the guilty plea and testimony.\n  The prosecutor rejected the proposal, and respondent withdrew the\n  original plea. Without that testimony, Billie was acquitted. Re-\n  spondent was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder. On\n  direct appeal, respondent argued that Toca provided ineffective assis-\n  tance by advising withdrawal of the plea without taking time to learn\n  the strength of the State’s evidence. The Michigan Court of Appeals\n  rejected the claim, concluding that Toca’s actions were reasonable in\n  light of his client’s protestations of innocence. On federal habeas re-\n  view, the District Court applied the deferential standard of review set\n  forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n  (AEDPA), concluded that the Michigan Court of Appeals’ ruling was\n  reasonable on the law and facts, and denied relief. The Sixth Circuit\n  reversed. It found the factual predicate for the state court’s deci-\n  sion—that the plea withdrawal was based on respondent’s assertion\n  of innocence—an unreasonable interpretation of the factual record,\n  given Toca’s explanation at the withdrawal hearing that the decision\n  to withdraw was made because the State’s original plea offer was\n  higher than the sentencing range provided by the Michigan guide-\n  lines. It also found no evidence in the record that Toca adequately\n  advised respondent of the consequences of withdrawal.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit failed to apply the “doubly deferential” stand-\n2                            BURT v.

Pp. 4–11.\n       (a) AEDPA recognizes the federalism principle that state courts are\n    adequate forums for the vindication of federal statutory and constitu-\n    tional rights. It erects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief\n    for prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state court, re-\n    quiring them to “show that the state court’s ruling . . . was so lacking\n    in justification that there was an error . . . beyond any possibility for\n    fairminded disagreement.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___.\n    Pp. 4–6.\n       (b) Here, the record readily supports the Michigan Court of Ap-\n    peals’ factual finding that Toca advised withdrawal of the guilty plea\n    only after respondent’s proclamation of innocence. The facts that re-\n    spondent passed a polygraph test denying being in the room when\n    Billie’s husband was killed, discussed the case with a jailer who ad-\n    vised against pleading guilty if respondent was indeed innocent, and\n    hired Toca just three days before Billie’s trial at which respondent\n    had agreed to self-incriminate, strongly suggest that respondent had\n    second thoughts about confessing in open court and proclaimed inno-\n    cence to Toca. The only evidence cited by the Sixth Circuit for its\n    contrary conclusion was that Toca’s sole explanation at the with-\n    drawal hearing focused on the fact that the State’s plea offer was\n    substantially higher than that provided by the Michigan guidelines.\n    The Michigan Court of Appeals was well aware of Toca’s representa-\n    tions to the trial court and correctly found nothing inconsistent about\n    a defendant’s asserting innocence on the one hand and refusing to\n    plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied by higher-than-normal\n    punishment on the other. Accepting as true the Michigan Court of\n    Appeals’ factual determination that respondent proclaimed innocence\n    to Toca, the Sixth Circuit’s Strickland analysis cannot be sustained.\n    More troubling is that court’s conclusion that Toca was ineffective be-\n    cause the record contained no evidence that he gave constitutionally\n    adequate advice on whether to withdraw the plea. The Sixth Circuit\n    turned on its head the principle that counsel should be “strongly pre-\n    sumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant\n    decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment,” Strick-\n    land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 690, with the burden to show oth-\n    erwise resting squarely on the defendant, id., at 687. The single fact\n    that Toca failed to retrieve respondent’s file from former counsel be-\n    fore withdrawing the guilty plea cannot overcome Strickland’s strong\n    presumption of effectiveness. In any event, respondent admitted in\n    open court that former counsel had explained the State’s evidence\n    and that it would support a first-degree murder conviction. Toca was\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Toca’s conduct in this\n  litigation was far from exemplary, but a lawyer’s ethical violations do\n  not make the lawyer per se ineffective, and Toca’s questionable con-\n  duct was irrelevant to the narrow issue before the Sixth Circuit.\n  Pp. 6–11.\n680 F. 3d 577, reversed.\n\n   ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 17). In this case, the Sixth Circuit failed to\napply that doubly deferential standard by refusing to\ncredit a state court’s reasonable factual finding and by\nassuming that counsel was ineffective where the record\nwas silent. Because the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), do not\npermit federal judges to so casually second-guess the\ndecisions of their state-court colleagues or defense attor­\nneys, the Sixth Circuit’s decision must be reversed.\n                           I\n  Respondent Titlow and Billie Rogers, respondent’s aunt,\nmurdered Billie’s husband Don by pouring vodka down his\nthroat and smothering him with a pillow. With help from\n2                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattorney Richard Lustig, respondent reached an agree­\nment with state prosecutors to testify against Billie, plead\nguilty to manslaughter, and receive a 7- to 15-year sen­\ntence. As confirmed at a plea hearing, Lustig reviewed the\nState’s evidence with respondent “over a long period of\ntime,” and respondent understood that that evidence could\nsupport a conviction for first-degree murder. App. 43–44.\nThe Michigan trial court approved the plea bargain.\n   Three days before Billie Rogers’ trial was to commence,\nhowever, respondent retained a new lawyer, Frederick\nToca. With Toca’s help, respondent demanded a substan­\ntially lower minimum sentence (three years, instead of\nseven) in exchange for the agreement to plead guilty and\ntestify. When the prosecutor refused to accede to the new\ndemands, respondent withdrew the plea, acknowledging\nin open court the consequences of withdrawal (including\nreinstatement of the first-degree murder charge). Without\nrespondent’s critical testimony, Billie Rogers was acquit­\nted, and later died.\n   Respondent subsequently stood trial. During the course\nof the trial, respondent denied any intent to harm Don\nRogers or any knowledge, at the time respondent covered\nhis mouth or poured vodka down his throat, that Billie\nintended to harm him. Indeed, respondent testified to\nattempting to prevent Billie from harming her husband.\nThe jury, however, elected to believe respondent’s previous\nout-of-court statements, which squarely demonstrated\nparticipation in the killing, and convicted respondent of\nsecond-degree murder. The trial court imposed a 20- to\n40-year term of imprisonment.\n   On direct appeal, respondent argued that Toca advised\nwithdrawal of the guilty plea without taking time to learn\nmore about the case, thereby failing to realize the strength\nof the State’s evidence and providing ineffective assistance\nof counsel. Rejecting that claim, the Michigan Court of\nAppeals found that Toca acted reasonably in light of his\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)              3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclient’s protestations of innocence. That court found that\nrespondent’s decision to hire Toca was “set in motion” by\nrespondent’s “statement to a sheriff ’s deputy that [re­\nspondent] did not commit the offense.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 101a. Applying the standard set forth by our deci­\nsion in Strickland, which requires that defense counsel\nsatisfy “an objective standard of reasonableness,” 466\nU. S., at 688, the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded\nthat “[w]hen a defendant proclaims . . . innocence . . . , it is\nnot objectively unreasonable to recommend that the de­\nfendant refrain from pleading guilty—no matter how\n‘good’ the deal may appear.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 102a.\n   Respondent then filed a federal habeas petition under\n28 U. S. C. §2254. Applying AEDPA’s deferential stand­\nard of review, the District Court concluded that the Michi­\ngan Court of Appeals’ ruling was “completely reasonable\non the law and the facts” and denied relief. No. 07–CV–\n13614, 2010 WL 4115410, *15 (ED Mich., Oct. 19, 2010).\nIn particular, the District Court concluded that “[c]ounsel\ncould not be ineffective by trying to negotiate a better plea\nagreement for [Titlow] with Billie Rogers’s trial imminent\nand [Titlow] stating at the time that Billie Rogers had\ncommitted the murder without . . . assistance.” Ibid.\n   The Sixth Circuit reversed. It found that the factual\npredicate for the state court’s decision—that the with­\ndrawal of the plea was based on respondent’s assertion of\ninnocence—was an unreasonable interpretation of the\nfactual record, given Toca’s explanation at the withdrawal\nhearing that “the decision to withdraw Titlow’s plea was\nbased on the fact that the State’s plea offer was substan­\ntially higher than the Michigan guidelines for second­\ndegree murder.” 680 F. 3d 577, 589 (2012). Further\nobserving that “[t]he record in this case contains no evi­\ndence” that Toca fully informed respondent of the possible\nconsequences of withdrawing the guilty plea, the Sixth\nCircuit held that Toca rendered ineffective assistance of\n4                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncounsel that resulted in respondent’s loss of the benefit of\nthe plea bargain. Id., at 589–592. Citing our decision in\nLafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___ (2012), the Sixth Circuit\nremanded this case with instructions that the prosecution\nmust reoffer the original plea agreement to respondent,\nand that the state court should “consul[t]” the plea agree­\nment and “fashion” a remedy for the violation of respond­\nent’s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel during plea bargaining. 680 F. 3d, at 592. Chief\nJudge Batchelder dissented on the grounds that the Mich­\nigan Court of Appeals’ decision was reasonable. Id., at\n593.\n  On remand, the prosecution followed the Sixth Circuit’s\ninstructions and reoffered the plea agreement it had of­\nfered some 10 years before—even though, in light of Billie\nRogers’ acquittal and subsequent death, respondent was\nno longer able to deliver on the promises originally made\nto the prosecution. At the plea hearing, however, re­\nspondent balked, refusing to provide a factual basis for the\nplea which the court could accept. Respondent admitted\nto pouring vodka down Don Rogers’ throat, but denied\nassisting in killing him or knowing that pouring vodka\ndown his throat could lead to his death. As at trial, re­\nspondent testified to attempting to prevent Billie Rogers\nfrom harming her husband. Eventually, after conferring\nwith current counsel (not Toca), respondent admitted to\nplacing Don Rogers in danger by pouring vodka down his\nthroat with the knowledge that his death could result.\nThe trial court took the plea under advisement, where the\nmatter stands at present.

S. C. §2254(d)(2).\nThe prisoner bears the burden of rebutting the state\ncourt’s factual findings “by clear and convincing evidence.”\n§2254(e)(1). We have not defined the precise relationship\nbetween §2254(d)(2) and §2254(e)(1), and we need not do\nso here. See Wood v. Allen, 558 U. S. 290, 293 (2010). For\npresent purposes, it is enough to reiterate “that a state­\ncourt factual determination is not unreasonable merely\nbecause the federal habeas court would have reached a\ndifferent conclusion in the first instance.” Id., at 301.\nAEDPA likewise imposes a highly deferential standard for\nreviewing claims of legal error by the state courts: A writ\nof habeas corpus may issue only if the state court’s deci­\nsion “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable appli­\ncation of, clearly established Federal law, as determined\nby” this Court. §2254(d)(1).\n   AEDPA recognizes a foundational principle of our fed-\neral system: State courts are adequate forums for the vindi-\ncation of federal rights. “[T]he States possess sovereignty\nconcurrent with that of the Federal Government, subject\nonly to limitations imposed by the Supremacy Clause.\nUnder this system of dual sovereignty, we have consist-\nently held that state courts have inherent authority, and\nare thus presumptively competent, to adjudicate claims\narising under the laws of the United States.” Tafflin v.\nLevitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458 (1990). This principle applies to\nclaimed violations of constitutional, as well as statutory,\nrights. See Trainor v. Hernandez, 431 U. S. 434, 443\n(1977). Indeed, “state courts have the solemn responsibil­\nity equally with the federal courts to safeguard constitu­\ntional rights,” and this Court has refused to sanction any\ndecision that would “reflec[t] negatively upon [a] state\ncourt’s ability to do so.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Especially where a case involves such a common\n6                     BURT v.

Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 494, n. 35 (1976) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  Recognizing the duty and ability of our state-court\ncolleagues to adjudicate claims of constitutional wrong,\nAEDPA erects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief\nfor prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state\ncourt. AEDPA requires “a state prisoner [to] show that\nthe state court’s ruling on the claim being presented in\nfederal court was so lacking in justification that there was\nan error . . . beyond any possibility for fairminded disa­\ngreement.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 13). “If this standard is difficult to\nmeet”—and it is—“that is because it was meant to be.”\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 12).

Respondent passed a polygraph denying planning\nto kill Don Rogers or being in the room when he died.\nThereafter, according to an affidavit in the record, re­\nspondent discussed the case with a jailer, who advised\nagainst pleading guilty if respondent was not in fact\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

App. 298 (affidavit of William Pierson).1 That\nconversation “set into motion” respondent’s decision to\nretain Toca. Ibid., ¶8. Those facts, together with the\ntiming of Toca’s hiring—on the eve of the trial at which\nrespondent was to self-incriminate—strongly suggest that\nrespondent had second thoughts about confessing in open\ncourt and proclaimed innocence to Toca. That conclusion\nis further bolstered by respondent’s maintenance of inno­\ncence of Don Rogers’ death at trial.\n   Indeed, reading the record in any other way is difficult.\nRespondent’s first lawyer, Lustig, had negotiated a deal\nthat was quite favorable in light of the fact, admitted by\nrespondent in open court, that the State’s evidence could\nsupport a conviction for first-degree murder. This deal\ninvolved a guilty plea to manslaughter and a 7- to 15-year\nsentence—far less than the mandatory sentence of life in\nprison that results from a conviction for first-degree mur­\nder under Michigan law. See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n§750.316 (West Supp. 2013). Yet after a jailer advised\nagainst pleading guilty if respondent was not guilty, some-\nthing caused respondent both to fire Lustig and hire Toca\n(who within a few days withdrew the guilty plea), and\nthen to maintain innocence at trial. If that something was\nnot a desire to assert innocence, it is difficult to imagine\nwhat it was, and respondent does not offer an alternative\ntheory.\n   The only evidence the Sixth Circuit cited for its conclu­\nsion that the plea withdrawal was not based on respond­\nent’s proclamation of innocence was that, when Toca\n——————\n  1 Respondent complains that the state court improperly relied on this\n\naffidavit, but it was respondent who provided the affidavit to the state\ncourt and asked it to rely on the affidavit as part of the ground for\nremanding for an evidentiary hearing. In any event, even if the state\ncourt used the affidavit for a purpose not permitted by state law—a\nproposition we do not endorse—that would not empower a federal court\nto grant habeas relief. See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72 (1991).\n8                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoved to withdraw the guilty plea, he “did not refer to\nTitlow’s claims of innocence,” but instead “explained that\nthe decision to withdraw [the] plea was based on the fact\nthat the State’s plea offer was substantially higher than\nthe Michigan guidelines” for manslaughter. 680 F. 3d, at\n589. The Sixth Circuit believed that this fact “sufficiently\nrebuts the Michigan Court of Appeals’ finding that the\nplea withdrawal was based on Titlow’s assertion of inno­\ncence.” Ibid.\n   But the Michigan Court of Appeals was well aware of\nToca’s representations to the trial court, noting in its\nopinion that respondent “moved to withdraw [the] plea\nbecause the agreed upon sentence exceeded the sentencing\nguidelines range.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a. The Michi­\ngan Court of Appeals, however—unlike the Sixth Circuit—\nalso correctly recognized that there is nothing inconsistent\nabout a defendant’s asserting innocence on the one hand\nand refusing to plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied\nby higher-than-normal punishment on the other. Indeed,\na defendant convinced of his or her own innocence may\nhave a particularly optimistic view of the likelihood of\nacquittal, and therefore be more likely to drive a hard\nbargain with the prosecution before pleading guilty.\nViewing the record as a whole, we conclude that the Sixth\nCircuit improperly set aside a “reasonable state-court\ndeterminatio[n] of fact in favor of its own debatable inter­\npretation of the record.” Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333, 335\n(2006).\n   Accepting as true the Michigan Court of Appeals’ factual\ndetermination that respondent proclaimed innocence to\nToca, the Sixth Circuit’s Strickland analysis cannot be\nsustained. Although a defendant’s proclamation of inno­\ncence does not relieve counsel of his normal responsibili­\nties under Strickland, it may affect the advice counsel\ngives. The Michigan Court of Appeals’ conclusion that\nToca’s advice satisfied Strickland fell within the bounds of\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                  9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nreasonableness under AEDPA, given that respondent was\nclaiming innocence and only days away from offering self­\nincriminating testimony in open court pursuant to a plea\nagreement involving an above-guidelines sentence.2 See\nFlorida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175, 187 (2004) (explaining\nthat the defendant has the “ ‘ultimate authority’ ” to decide\nwhether to accept a plea bargain); Brookhart v. Janis, 384\nU. S. 1, 7–8 (1966) (observing that a lawyer must not\n“override his client’s desire . . . to plead not guilty”). The\nSixth Circuit’s conclusion to the contrary was error.\n  Even more troubling is the Sixth Circuit’s conclusion\nthat Toca was ineffective because the “record in this case\ncontains no evidence that” he gave constitutionally ade­\nquate advice on whether to withdraw the guilty plea. 680\nF. 3d, at 590. We have said that counsel should be\n“strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance\nand made all significant decisions in the exercise of rea­\nsonable professional judgment,” Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n690, and that the burden to “show that counsel’s perfor­\nmance was deficient” rests squarely on the defendant, id.,\nat 687. The Sixth Circuit turned that presumption of\neffectiveness on its head. It should go without saying that\nthe absence of evidence cannot overcome the “strong pre­\nsumption that counsel’s conduct [fell] within the wide\nrange of reasonable professional assistance.” Id., at 689.\nAs Chief Judge Batchelder correctly explained in her\ndissent, “[w]ithout evidence that Toca gave incorrect ad­\nvice or evidence that he failed to give material advice,\nTitlow cannot establish that his performance was defi­\ncient.” 680 F. 3d, at 595.\n  The Sixth Circuit pointed to a single fact in support of\n\n——————\n  2 We  assume, arguendo, as did the Michigan Court of Appeals, that\nToca went beyond facilitating respondent’s withdrawal of the plea and\nadvised withdrawal, although we note that the sole basis in the record\nfor this assertion appears to be respondent’s self-serving testimony.\n10                    BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits conclusion that Toca failed to adequately advise re­\nspondent: his failure to retrieve respondent’s file from\nLustig before withdrawing the guilty plea. Id., at 590.\nBut here, too, the Sixth Circuit deviated from Strickland’s\nstrong presumption of effectiveness. The record does not\nreveal how much Toca was able to glean about respond­\nent’s case from other sources; he may well have obtained\ncopies of the critical materials from prosecutors or the\ncourt. (Indeed, Toca’s statement at the plea withdrawal\nhearing that “[t]here’s a lot of material here” strongly\nsuggests that he did have access to a source of documenta­\ntion other than Lustig’s file. App. 71.)\n   In any event, the same considerations were relevant to\nentering and withdrawing the guilty plea, and respondent\nadmitted in open court when initially pleading guilty that\nLustig had explained the State’s evidence and that this\nevidence would support a conviction for first-degree mur­\nder. Toca was justified in relying on this admission to\nconclude that respondent understood the strength of the\nprosecution’s case and nevertheless wished to withdraw\nthe plea. With respondent having knowingly entered the\nguilty plea, we think any confusion about the strength of\nthe State’s evidence upon withdrawing the plea less than a\nmonth later highly unlikely.\n   Despite our conclusion that there was no factual or legal\njustification for overturning the state court’s decision, we\nrecognize that Toca’s conduct in this litigation was far\nfrom exemplary. He may well have violated the rules of\nprofessional conduct by accepting respondent’s publication\nrights as partial payment for his services, and he waited\nweeks before consulting respondent’s first lawyer about\nthe case. But the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee\nthe right to perfect counsel; it promises only the right to\neffective assistance, and we have held that a lawyer’s\nviolation of ethical norms does not make the lawyer per se\nineffective. See Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U. S. 162, 171\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                 11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n(2002). Troubling as Toca’s actions were, they were irrele­\nvant to the narrow question that was before the Sixth\nCircuit: whether the state court reasonably determined\nthat respondent was adequately advised before deciding to\nwithdraw the guilty plea. Because the Michigan Court of\nAppeals’ decision that respondent was so advised is rea­\nsonable and supported by the record, the Sixth Circuit’s\njudgment is reversed.3\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  3 Because we conclude that the Sixth Circuit erred in finding Toca’s\n\nrepresentation constitutionally ineffective, we do not reach the other\nquestions presented by this case, namely, whether respondent ade­\nquately demonstrated prejudice, and whether the Sixth Circuit’s\nremedy is at odds with our decision in Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___\n(2012).\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

As our opinion notes, she\nbore the burden of overcoming two presumptions: that\nToca performed effectively and that the state court ruled\ncorrectly. She failed to carry this burden. We need not\nsay more, and indeed we do not say more. I therefore join\nthe Court’s opinion in full. I write separately, however, to\nexpress my understanding of our opinion’s limited scope,\nparticularly with respect to two statements that it makes\nabout the adequacy of Toca’s performance.\n   First, we state that “[a]lthough a defendant’s proclama-\ntion of innocence does not relieve counsel of his normal\nresponsibilities under Strickland, it may affect the advice\ncounsel gives.” Ante, at 8. The first part of that statement\nbears emphasis: Regardless of whether a defendant as-\nserts her innocence (or admits her guilt), her counsel must\n“make an independent examination of the facts, circum-\nstances, pleadings and laws involved and then . . . offer his\ninformed opinion as to what plea should be entered.” Von\nMoltke v. Gillies, 332 U. S. 708, 721 (1948) (plurality\nopinion). A defendant possesses “ ‘the ultimate authority’ ”\nto determine her plea. Florida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175,\n2                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n187 (2004). But a lawyer must abide by his client’s deci-\nsion in this respect only after having provided the client\nwith competent and fully informed advice, including an\nanalysis of the risks that the client would face in proceed-\ning to trial. Given our recognition that “a defendant’s\nproclamation of innocence does not relieve counsel of his\nnormal responsibilities,” ante, at 8, our further observa-\ntion that such a proclamation “may affect the advice coun-\nsel gives,” ibid., states only the obvious: that a lawyer’s\nadvice will always reflect the objectives of the representa-\ntion, as determined by the adequately informed client.\n   Second, we state that it was reasonable for the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals to reject respondent’s claim, “given that\nrespondent was claiming innocence and only days away\nfrom offering self-incriminating testimony” at her aunt’s\ntrial. Ante, at 9. This is true in context: Because respond-\nent failed to carry her burden of showing that Toca’s per-\nformance was not adequate, the state court reasonably\nheld that it was. But our statement about the facts of this\ncase does not imply that an attorney performs effectively\nin advising his client to withdraw from a plea whenever\nthe client asserts her innocence and has only a few days to\nmake the decision. Had respondent made a better factual\nrecord—had she actually shown, for example, that Toca\nfailed to educate himself about the case before recom-\nmending that she withdraw her plea—then she could well\nhave prevailed.\n   Because (and only because) respondent failed to present\nenough evidence to overcome the twin presumptions of\nAEDPA and Strickland, I join fully in the opinion of the\nCourt.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

As the Court rightly observes, Toca’s conduct\nwas “far from exemplary.” Ante, at 10. With virtually no\ntime to make an assessment of Titlow’s chances of prevail-\ning at trial, and without consulting the lawyer who had\nnegotiated Titlow’s plea, Toca told Titlow he could take\nthe case to trial and win. App. 295 (Titlow’s uncontra-\ndicted averment). With Toca’s aid, Titlow’s plea was with-\ndrawn just three days after Toca’s retention as defense\ncounsel. At sentencing, the prosecutor volunteered that\nTitlow had been the “victim of some bad advice.” Id., at\n291.\n  Nevertheless, one thing is crystal clear. The prosecu-\ntor’s agreement to the plea bargain hinged entirely on\nTitlow’s willingness to testify at her aunt’s trial. See App.\n42–43, 45. Once Titlow reneged on that half of the deal,\nthe bargain failed. Absent an extant bargain, there was\nnothing to renew. See Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S.\n129, 137 (2009) (“Although the analogy may not hold in\nall respects, plea bargains are essentially contracts. . . .\n2                      BURT v.

In short, the prosecutor could\nnot be ordered to “renew” a plea proposal never offered in\nthe first place. With the plea offer no longer alive, Titlow\nwas convicted after a trial free from reversible error. See\nApp. 295.
