The petition for a writ of certi-\norari is denied.\n   JUSTICE ALITO, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting\nfrom the denial of certiorari.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit granted habeas relief in this case after concluding\nthat New York’s highest court unreasonably applied our\ndecision in United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218 (1967),\nwhen it determined that a witness’ prolonged observation\nof a burglar in a well-lighted area of her own home pro-\nvided an independent source for her in-court identification of\nrespondent. Because the Second Circuit’s decision contra-\nvenes the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nof 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, our decision in Cullen v.\nPinholster, 563 U.

In a well-lighted area of the home, the bur-\nglar brandished an axe over the head of Mr. Sykes, who\nwas confined to a wheelchair, and demanded money. Mrs.\nSykes was standing only three or four feet away from the\nburglar. Although his body was covered with a blanket\nand the lower part of his face with a scarf, Mrs. Sykes was\nable to observe clearly the upper part of his face. At first\nMrs. Sykes was unable to believe that a burglar had en-\n2                     UNGER v. YOUNG\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntered the house; she thought the incident might be a\nprank by someone she knew, and therefore stared at the\nburglar’s eyes to see if she could detect his identity.\n   The burglar remained in the Sykeses’ home for five to\nseven minutes. During the course of the burglary, he took\ncash from Mr. Sykes’ wallet and Mrs. Sykes’ purse, as well\nas three watches, and a pair of binoculars with the name\n“Sykes” written on them. Mrs. Sykes continued to stare\nat the burglar while he was in the house, at one point\nprompting the burglar to order her, “ ‘Don’t look at my\nface.’ ” App. C to App. to Pet. for Cert. 101a. After ripping\ntwo telephones out of the wall to prevent Mr. or Mrs.\nSykes from calling the police, the burglar left the house.\n   The police later arrested respondent. Mrs. Sykes identi-\nfied him at a lineup on the basis of his appearance and\nvoice, but a state court later concluded that the police\nlacked probable cause to arrest respondent, and that the\nlineup was tainted by the illegal arrest.\n   At respondent’s trial, the prosecution introduced a va-\nriety of evidence that respondent was the burglar. For in-\nstance, an acquaintance of respondent’s testified that, at\nabout the time of the burglary, respondent sold her a pair\nof binoculars bearing the name “Sykes” and three watches\nlike those stolen from the Sykeses’ home. Mrs. Sykes also\ntestified and identified respondent as the burglar. She\nwas permitted to identify respondent on the grounds that\nher observations of the burglar during the course of the\ncrime provided an independent source of identification.\n   On direct appeal, the New York Court of Appeals cor-\nrectly cited this Court’s decision in Wade, supra, as provid-\ning the governing standard for respondent’s independent\nsource challenge, which it rejected. People v. Young, 7\nN. Y. 3d 40, 44, 850 N. E. 2d 623, 626 (2006). Respondent\nthen filed a petition for habeas relief, which the District\nCourt granted. The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding\nthat the New York Court of Appeals’ application of Wade\nwas unreasonable because all six Wade factors favored\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nrespondent. In particular, the Second Circuit cited two\nsources of authority for its determination that the first\nWade factor, the witness’ “prior opportunity to observe the\nalleged criminal act,” Wade, supra, at 241, favored re-\nspondent: Second Circuit precedent and several social\nscience studies that questioned an eyewitness’ ability to\nmake an accurate identification in circumstances like\nthose present here. Young v. Conway, 698 F. 3d 69, 80–83\n(2012).\n  The State petitioned for rehearing en banc. The Second\nCircuit denied the petition, with Judges Cabranes, Raggi,\nand Livingston dissenting from denial.\n                                II\n  There is no dispute that the New York Court of Appeals\napplied the correct legal standard in this case. Nor is it\ndisputed that, because this Court has not given relevant\nguidance on how to weigh the various Wade factors, the\nSecond Circuit’s decision is tenable only if that court\ncorrectly concluded that all the factors favor respondent.\n  That conclusion, however, is deeply flawed. In the first\nplace, the Second Circuit relied on its own precedent to\ndetermine that the first Wade factor favored respondent—\na choice that AEDPA clearly forecloses. See 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(1) (limiting habeas relief to cases in which a state\ncourt rendered a decision “that was contrary to, or in-\nvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States”).\n  The only other basis for the Second Circuit’s conclusion\non the first factor is its citation to several social science\nstudies that were never presented to the state courts. We\nstated very clearly in Pinholster that “review under\n§2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the\nstate court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.” 563\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). The lower court attempted to\ndistinguish Pinholster by explaining that the social science\n4                         UNGER v. YOUNG\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nstudies “reinforced,” but did not “compe[ l ] or contro[ l ],” its\nconclusion that the New York Court of Appeals unreason-\nably applied Wade. 698 F. 3d, at 79, n. 8. But we drew\nno such distinction between “reinforcing” and “controlling”\nevidence in Pinholster, and the Second Circuit erred by\ndoing so here. In any event, if it is true that the studies\nmerely “reinforced” the Second Circuit’s conclusion, then\nthat conclusion must have been “compelled” by the only\nother authority on which the court relied: its own prec-\nedent.    And as noted, AEDPA flatly prohibits such\nreliance.*\n   More fundamentally, the Second Circuit’s disagreement\nis not with the New York Court of Appeals; it is with us.\nMrs. Sykes unquestionably had a substantial opportunity\nto observe the burglar. We held in Wade that “the prior\nopportunity to observe the alleged criminal act” favors\nfinding that an independent source exists. 388 U. S., at\n241. The Second Circuit held, to the contrary, that such\nan opportunity does not suggest the existence of an in-\ndependent source in the circumstances of this case. Wade\nsimply does not leave that option on the table.\n   The Second Circuit’s decision creates loopholes in both\nPinholster and Wade. In my view, the importance of this\nissue warrants review at this time. I respectfully dissent\nfrom the denial of certiorari.\n\n——————\n  * The analysis of the court below cannot be defended on the ground\nthat Pinholster concerns only adjudicative facts and that the data in the\nsocial science studies constituted legislative facts. See Advisory Com-\nmittee’s Note on subd. (a) of Fed. Rule Evid. 201, 28 U. S. C. App.,\np. 319. Pinholster does not mention any such distinction, but even if\nPinholster is limited in this way, the Second Circuit’s analysis would\nstill be flawed. By accepting and applying the factual conclusions\ndrawn in the studies in question to conclude that, in the circumstances\npresented, Mrs. Sykes’ prior opportunity to observe the burglar did not\nsuggest the existence of an independent source, the Second Circuit\nsignificantly altered the holding in Wade, as explained infra this page.\n</pre>", "id": 2641855, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/11/12/unger_v._young.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                  Cite as: 571 U.
