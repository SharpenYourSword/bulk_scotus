Under\nHarrington, when a state court summarily rejects an\nappeal without clearly indicating whether the disposition\nwas based on the merits of the claims presented or instead\non procedural grounds, a federal habeas court must pre-\nsume that the decision was on the merits, but the pre-\nsumption may be overcome under certain circumstances.\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 9).

See 703\nF. 3d, at 351 (citing Cullen, supra). And based on evidence\nthat respondent had presented at the federal hearing, the\nSixth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s holdings that\nrespondent had demonstrated cause and prejudice to ex-\ncuse procedural default; that his trial counsel had been\nineffective; and that, as a result, he was entitled to habeas\nrelief.\n   Judge McKeague dissented.
