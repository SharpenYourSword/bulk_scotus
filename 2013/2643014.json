See Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 434\n(2009). The first two factors are “the most critical.” Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals analyzed the first factor at length\nand concluded that the State was likely to prevail on the\nmerits of the constitutional question. The dissent does not\njoin issue with that conclusion; it says only that the ques-\ntion is “difficult.” Post, at 4. Standing alone, that ob-\nservation cuts against vacatur, since the difficulty of a\nquestion is inversely proportional to the likelihood that a\ngiven answer will be clearly erroneous. With respect to the\nsecond factor, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the\nState faced irreparable harm because “ ‘[a]ny time a State\nis enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted\nby representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irrepa-\nrable injury.’ ” Maryland v.

It\nthus fails to allege any error, let alone obvious error, in the\nCourt of Appeals’ determination that the two “most criti-\ncal” factors weighed in favor of the stay.\n   One might think that would be the end of the matter.\nYet the dissent asserts that “the balance of harms tilts in\nfavor of [the] applicants,” post, at 4—presumably referring\nto the third relevant factor, whether the stay would sub-\nstantially injure third parties.
