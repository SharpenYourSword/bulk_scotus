See 2013 Texas House Bill No. 2.\nThe amendment now at issue requires a physician per-\nforming an abortion to have admitting privileges at a\nhospital within 30 miles. Applicants challenged the\namendments in Federal District Court, arguing (among\nother things) that they violate the constitutional right to\nhave an abortion. See Planned Parenthood of Southeast-\nern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992).\n  The District Court held a bench trial and, on the day\nbefore the amendments were to go into effect, issued an\nopinion and order holding that the admitting privileges\nrequirement is unconstitutional and permanently enjoin-\ning its enforcement. __ F.

The District Court concluded\nthat “admitting privileges have no rational relationship to\nimproved patient care” and “do not rationally relate to the\nState’s legitimate interest in protecting the unborn.” Id.,\nat *5. And the court explained that, in its view, the admit-\nting privileges requirement is unconstitutional because it\n2   PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF GREATER TEX. SURGICAL\n             HEALTH SERVICES v. ABBOTT \n\n                 BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nis “without a rational basis and places a substantial obsta-\ncle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonvi-\nable fetus.” Id., at *2; see also Gonzales v.

The Court of\nAppeals granted the stay, which had the effect of allowing\nthe admitting privileges requirement to go into force im-\nmediately. ___ F. 3d ___, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5857853</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Oct. 31,\n2013). In deciding to issue the stay, the Fifth Circuit\nundertook to apply the traditional analysis, which re-\nquires a balancing of four factors: “ ‘(1) whether the stay\napplicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to\nsucceed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be\nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of\nthe stay will substantially injure the other parties inter-\nested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest\nlies.’ ” Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 426 (2009) (quoting\nHilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 776 (1987)). The Fifth\nCircuit thought that the State was likely to prevail on the\nmerits, that the injunction would irreparably injure it by\npreventing it from implementing its statute at least until\nthe Fifth Circuit reached a final decision, and that the\npublic interest merged with the State’s interest in the en-\nforcement of its law. The Fifth Circuit recognized that ap-\nplicants had “made a strong showing that their interests\nwould be harmed by staying the injunction,” but it con-\ncluded that “given the State’s likely success on the merits,\nthis is not enough, standing alone, to outweigh the other\nfactors.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5857853</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *9.\n   As a practical matter, the Fifth Circuit’s decision to stay\n                   Cite as: 571 U.

And it means that women who were planning\nto receive abortions at those clinics were forced to go else-\nwhere—in some cases 100 miles or more—to obtain a safe\nabortion, or else not to obtain one at all. The Fifth Circuit\nset the appeal for expedited consideration, with oral argu-\nment to be held in January 2014 and, I assume, a deci-\nsion to issue soon thereafter. See ibid.\n   Applicants, the plaintiffs in the District Court, now ask\nthis Court to vacate the Fifth Circuit’s stay, meaning that\nthe District Court’s injunction would be reinstated and\nthose clinics that were forced to close could reopen while\nthe Fifth Circuit receives briefing and renders its consid-\nered decision on the merits.\n   This Court may vacate a stay entered by a court of\nappeals where the case “ ‘could and very likely would be\nreviewed here upon final disposition in the court of ap-\npeals,’ ” “ ‘the rights of the parties . . . may be seriously and\nirreparably injured by the stay,’ ” and “ ‘the court of ap-\npeals is demonstrably wrong in its application of accepted\nstandards in deciding to issue the stay.’ ” Western Airlines,\nInc. v. Teamsters, 480 U. S. 1301, 1305 (1987) (O’Connor,\nJ., in chambers) (quoting Coleman v. Paccar Inc., 424\nU. S. 1301, 1304 (1976) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers)). For\nthe following reasons, I believe that these conditions are\nsatisfied here.\n   First, under the status quo that existed in Texas prior to\nthe enactment of the admitting privileges requirement,\nwomen across the State of Texas who needed abortions\nhad a certain level of access to clinics that would provide\nthem. If allowed to stand, the District Court’s injunction\nwould maintain that status quo pending the decision of\nthis case by the Court of Appeals.\n   Second, the Fifth Circuit’s stay seriously disrupts that\n4   PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF GREATER TEX. SURGICAL\n             HEALTH SERVICES v. ABBOTT \n\n                 BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nstatus quo. By putting Texas’ new law into immediate\neffect, it instantly leaves “24 counties in the Rio Grande\nValley . . . with no abortion provider because those provid-\ners do not have admitting privileges and are unlikely to\nget them,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5781583</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *5, and it may substantially\nreduce access to safe abortions elsewhere in Texas. Ap-\nplicants assert that 20,000 women in Texas will be left\nwithout service. While the State denies this assertion, it\nprovides no assurance that a significant number of women\nseeking abortions will not be affected, and the District\nCourt unquestionably found that “there will be abortion\nclinics that will close.” Ibid. The longer a given facility\nremains closed, the less likely it is ever to reopen even if\nthe admitting privileges requirement is ultimately held\nunconstitutional.\n   Third, the Fifth Circuit has agreed to expedite its con-\nsideration of the challenge, minimizing the harm that the\ninjunction, if entered in error, would do to the State and\nbolstering my view that it is a mistake to disrupt the\nstatus quo so seriously before the Fifth Circuit has arrived\nat a considered decision on the merits.\n   Fourth, the balance of harms tilts in favor of applicants.\nIf the law is valid, then the District Court’s injunction\nharms the State by delaying for a few months a change to\nthe longstanding status quo. If the law is invalid, the\ninjunction properly prevented the potential for serious\nphysical or other harm to many women whose exercise of\ntheir constitutional right to obtain an abortion would be\nunduly burdened by the law. And although the injunction\nwill ultimately be reinstated if the law is indeed invalid,\nthe harms to the individual women whose rights it re-\nstricts while it remains in effect will be permanent.\n   Fifth, the underlying legal question—whether the new\nTexas statute is constitutional—is a difficult question. It\nis a question, I believe, that at least four Members of this\nCourt will wish to consider irrespective of the Fifth Cir-\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

See Nken, 556\nU. S., at 426; Western Airlines, supra, at 1305. I would\nmaintain the status quo while the lower courts consider\nthis difficult, sensitive, and controversial legal matter.\nThus, I would vacate the stay, and I dissent from the\nCourt’s refusal to do so.\n</pre>", "id": 2643015, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/11/19/planned_parenthood_of_greater_tex._surgical_health_services_v._abbott_1.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 571 U.
