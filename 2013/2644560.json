UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 13–113.   Decided December 2, 2013\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   When a taxpayer overpays his taxes, he is generally\nentitled to interest from the Government for the period\nbetween the payment and the ultimate refund. See 26\nU. S. C. §6611(a). That interest begins to run “from the\ndate of overpayment.” §§6611(b)(1), (b)(2). But the Code\ndoes not define “the date of overpayment.”\n   In this case, after the Internal Revenue Service advised\nFord Motor Company that it had underpaid its taxes from\n1983 until 1989, Ford remitted a series of deposits to the\nIRS totaling $875 million. Those deposits stopped the ac-\ncrual of interest that Ford would otherwise owe once the\naudits were completed and the amount of its underpay-\nment was finally determined. See §6601; Rev. Proc. 84–\n58, 1984–2 Cum. Bull. 501. Later, Ford requested that the\nIRS treat the deposits as advance payments of the addi-\ntional tax that Ford owed. Eventually the parties deter-\nmined that Ford had overpaid its taxes in the relevant\nyears, thereby entitling Ford to a return of the over-\npayment as well as interest. But the parties disagreed\nabout when the interest began to run under 26 U. S. C.\n§6611(b)(1). Ford argued that “the date of overpayment”\nwas the date that it first remitted the deposits to the IRS.\nIbid. The Government countered that the date of over-\npayment was the date that Ford requested that the IRS\ntreat the remittances as payments of tax. The difference\nbetween the parties’ competing interpretations of §6611(b)\nis worth some $445 million.\n   Ford sued the Government in Federal District Court,\n2            FORD MOTOR CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nasserting jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(1). The\nGovernment did not contest the court’s jurisdiction. See\nBrief in Opposition 3, n. 3. The District Court accepted\nthe Government’s construction of §6611(b) and granted its\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings. A panel of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, concluding\nthat §6611 is a waiver of sovereign immunity that must be\nconstrued strictly in favor of the Government. 508 Fed.\nAppx. 506 (2012).\n   Ford sought certiorari, arguing that the Sixth Circuit\nwas wrong to give §6611 a strict construction. In Ford’s\nview, it is 28 U. S. C. §1346—not §6611—that waives the\nGovernment’s immunity from this suit, and §6611(b) is a\nsubstantive provision that should not be construed strictly.\nSee Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 553 U. S. 474, 491 (2008);\nUnited States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S.\n465, 472–473 (2003). In its response to Ford’s petition for\ncertiorari, however, the Government contended for the\nfirst time that §1346(a)(1) does not apply at all to this suit;\nit argues that the only basis for jurisdiction, and “the only\ngeneral waiver of sovereign immunity that encompasses\n[Ford’s] claim,” is the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. §1491(a).\nBrief in Opposition 3, n. 3. Although the Government\nacquiesced in jurisdiction in the lower courts, if the Gov-\nernment is now correct that the Tucker Act applies to this\nsuit, jurisdiction over this case was proper only in the\nUnited States Court of Federal Claims.
