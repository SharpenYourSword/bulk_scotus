WOODS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12–562.      Argued October 9, 2013—Decided December 3, 2013\nRespondent Gary Woods and his employer, Billy Joe McCombs, partici-\n  pated in an offsetting-option tax shelter designed to generate large\n  paper losses that they could use to reduce their taxable income. To\n  that end, they purchased from Deutsche Bank a series of currency-\n  option spreads. Each spread was a package consisting of a long op-\n  tion, which Woods and McCombs purchased from Deutsche Bank and\n  for which they paid a premium, and a short option, which Woods and\n  McCombs sold to Deutsche Bank and for which they received a pre-\n  mium. Because the premium paid for the long option was largely off-\n  set by the premium received for the short option, the net cost of the\n  package to Woods and McCombs was substantially less than the cost\n  of the long option alone. Woods and McCombs contributed the\n  spreads, along with cash, to two partnerships, which used the cash to\n  purchase stock and currency. When calculating their basis in the\n  partnership interests, Woods and McCombs considered only the long\n  component of the spreads and disregarded the nearly offsetting short\n  component. As a result, when the partnerships’ assets were disposed\n  of for modest gains, Woods and McCombs claimed huge losses. Al-\n  though they had contributed roughly $3.2 million in cash and spreads\n  to the partnerships, they claimed losses of more than $45 million.\n     The Internal Revenue Service sent each partnership a Notice of\n  Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment, disregarding the\n  partnerships for tax purposes and disallowing the related losses. It\n  concluded that the partnerships were formed for the purpose of tax\n  avoidance and thus lacked “economic substance,” i.e., they were\n  shams. As there were no valid partnerships for tax purposes, the IRS\n  determined that the partners could not claim a basis for their part-\n  nership interests greater than zero and that any resulting tax under-\n2                     UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    payments would be subject to a 40-percent penalty for gross valua-\n    tion misstatements. Woods sought judicial review. The District\n    Court held that the partnerships were properly disregarded as shams\n    but that the valuation-misstatement penalty did not apply. The Fifth\n    Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The District Court had jurisdiction to determine whether the\n partnerships’ lack of economic substance could justify imposing a\n valuation-misstatement penalty on the partners. Pp. 6–11.\n       (a) Because a partnership does not pay federal income taxes, its\n taxable income and losses pass through to the partners. Under the\n Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), the IRS\n initiates partnership-related tax proceedings at the partnership level\n to adjust “partnership items,” i.e., items relevant to the partnership\n as a whole. 26 U. S. C. §§6221, 6231(a)(3). Once the adjustments be-\n come final, the IRS may undertake further proceedings at the part-\n ner level to make any resulting “computational adjustments” in the\n tax liability of the individual partners.         §§6230(a)(1)–(2), (c),\n 6231(a)(6). Pp. 6–7.\n       (b) Under TEFRA’s framework, a court in a partnership-level\n proceeding has jurisdiction to determine “the applicability of any\n penalty . . . which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.”\n §6226(f). A determination that a partnership lacks economic sub-\n stance is such an adjustment. TEFRA authorizes courts in partner-\n ship-level proceedings to provisionally determine the applicability of\n any penalty that could result from an adjustment to a partnership\n item, even though imposing the penalty requires a subsequent, part-\n ner-level proceeding. In that later proceeding, each partner may\n raise any reasons why the penalty may not be imposed on him specif-\n ically. Applying those principles here, the District Court had juris-\n diction to determine the applicability of the valuation-misstatement\n penalty. Pp. 7–11.\n    2. The valuation-misstatement penalty applies in this case.\n Pp. 11–16.\n       (a) A penalty applies to the portion of any underpayment that is\n “attributable to” a “substantial” or “gross” “valuation misstatement,”\n which exists where “the value of any property (or the adjusted basis\n of any property) claimed on any return of tax” exceeds by a specified\n percentage “the amount determined to be the correct amount of such\n valuation or adjusted basis (as the case may be).” §§6662(a), (b)(3),\n (e)(1)(A), (h). The penalty’s plain language makes it applicable here.\n Once the partnerships were deemed not to exist for tax purposes, no\n partner could legitimately claim a basis in his partnership interest\n greater than zero. Any underpayment resulting from use of a non-\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  zero basis would therefore be “attributable to” the partner’s having\n  claimed an “adjusted basis” in the partnerships that exceeded “the\n  correct amount of such . . . adjusted basis.” §6662(e)(1)(A). And un-\n  der the relevant Treasury Regulation, when an asset’s adjusted basis\n  is zero, a valuation misstatement is automatically deemed gross.\n  Pp. 11–12.\n      (b) Woods’ contrary arguments are unpersuasive. The valuation-\n  misstatement penalty encompasses misstatements that rest on legal\n  as well as factual errors, so it is applicable to misstatements that rest\n  on the use of a sham partnership. And the partnerships’ lack of eco-\n  nomic substance is not an independent ground separate from the\n  misstatement of basis in this case. Pp. 12–16.\n471 Fed.

The Facts\n                             A\n  This case involves an offsetting-option tax shelter, vari­\nants of which were marketed to high-income taxpayers in\nthe late 1990’s. Tax shelters of this type sought to gener­\nate large paper losses that a taxpayer could use to reduce\ntaxable income. They did so by attempting to give the tax­\npayer an artificially high basis in a partnership interest,\nwhich enabled the taxpayer to claim a significant tax loss\nupon disposition of the interest. See IRS Notice 2000–44,\n2000–2 Cum. Bull. 255 (describing offsetting-option tax\nshelters).\n  The particular tax shelter at issue in this case was\ndeveloped by the now-defunct law firm Jenkens &\nGilchrist and marketed by the accounting firm Ernst &\n2                 UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nYoung under the name “Current Options Bring Reward\nAlternatives,” or COBRA. Respondent Gary Woods and\nhis employer, Billy Joe McCombs, agreed to participate in\nCOBRA to reduce their tax liability for 1999. To that end,\nin November 1999 they created two general partnerships:\none, Tesoro Drive Partners, to produce ordinary losses,\nand the other, SA Tesoro Investment Partners, to produce\ncapital losses.\n   Over the next two months, acting through their respec­\ntive wholly owned, limited liability companies, Woods and\nMcCombs executed a series of transactions. First, they\npurchased from Deutsche Bank five 30-day currency­\noption spreads. Each of these option spreads was a pack­\nage consisting of a so-called long option, which entitled\nWoods and McCombs to receive a sum of money from\nDeutsche Bank if a certain currency exchange rate ex­\nceeded a certain figure on a certain date, and a so-called\nshort option, which entitled Deutsche Bank to receive a\nsum of money from Woods and McCombs if the exchange\nrate for the same currency on the same date exceeded a\ncertain figure so close to the figure triggering the long\noption that both were likely to be triggered (or not to be\ntriggered) on the fated date. Because the premium paid to\nDeutsche Bank for purchase of the long option was largely\noffset by the premium received from Deutsche Bank for\nsale of the short option, the net cost of the package to\nWoods and McCombs was substantially less than the cost\nof the long option alone. Specifically, the premiums paid\nfor all five of the spreads’ long options totaled $46 million,\nand the premiums received for the five spreads’ short\noptions totaled $43.7 million, so the net cost of the spreads\nwas just $2.3 million. Woods and McCombs contributed\nthe spreads to the partnerships along with about $900,000\nin cash. The partnerships used the cash to purchase\nassets—Canadian dollars for the partnership that sought\nto produce ordinary losses, and Sun Microsystems stock\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor the partnership that sought to produce capital losses.\nThe partnerships then terminated the five option spreads\nin exchange for a lump-sum payment from Deutsche\nBank.\n  As the tax year drew to a close, Woods and McCombs\ntransferred their interests in the partnerships to two S\ncorporations. One corporation, Tesoro Drive Investors,\nInc., received both partners’ interests in Tesoro Drive\nPartners; the other corporation, SA Tesoro Drive Inves­\ntors, Inc., received both partners’ interests in SA Tesoro\nInvestment Partners. Since this left each partnership\nwith only a single partner (the relevant S corporation), the\npartnerships were liquidated by operation of law, and\ntheir assets—the Canadian dollars and Sun Microsystems\nstock, plus the remaining cash—were deemed distributed\nto the corporations. The corporations then sold those\nassets for modest gains of about $2,000 on the Canadian\ndollars and about $57,000 on the stock. But instead of\ngains, the corporations reported huge losses: an ordinary\nloss of more than $13 million on the sale of the Canadian\ndollars and a capital loss of more than $32 million on the\nsale of the stock. The losses were allocated between\nWoods and McCombs as the corporations’ co-owners.\n  The reason the corporations were able to claim such vast\nlosses—the alchemy at the heart of an offsetting-options\ntax shelter—lay in how Woods and McCombs calculated\nthe tax basis of their interests in the partnerships. Tax\nbasis is the amount used as the cost of an asset when\ncomputing how much its owner gained or lost for tax\npurposes when disposing of it. See J. Downes & J. Good­\nman, Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms 736\n(2010). A partner’s tax basis in a partnership interest—\ncalled “outside basis” to distinguish it from “inside basis,”\nthe partnership’s basis in its own assets—is tied to the\nvalue of any assets the partner contributed to acquire the\ninterest. See 26 U. S. C. §722. Collectively, Woods and\n4                UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMcCombs contributed roughly $3.2 million in option\nspreads and cash to acquire their interests in the two\npartnerships. But for purposes of computing outside\nbasis, Woods and McCombs considered only the long\ncomponent of the spreads and disregarded the nearly offset­\nting short component on the theory that it was “too con­\ntingent” to count. Brief for Respondent 14. As a result,\nthey claimed a total adjusted outside basis of more than\n$48 million. Since the basis of property distributed to a\npartner by a liquidating partnership is equal to the ad­\njusted basis of the partner’s interest in the partnership\n(reduced by any cash distributed with the property), see\n§732(b), the inflated outside basis figure was carried over\nto the S corporations’ basis in the Canadian dollars and\nthe stock, enabling the corporations to report enormous\nlosses when those assets were sold. At the end of the day,\nWoods’ and McCombs’ $3.2 million investment generated\ntax losses that, if treated as valid, could have shielded\nmore than $45 million of income from taxation.\n                              B\n  The Internal Revenue Service, however, did not treat\nthe COBRA-generated losses as valid. Instead, after\nauditing the partnerships’ tax returns, it issued to each\npartnership a Notice of Final Partnership Administrative\nAdjustment, or “FPAA.” In the FPAAs, the IRS deter­\nmined that the partnerships had been “formed and availed\nof solely for purposes of tax avoidance by artificially over­\nstating basis in the partnership interests of [the] purported\npartners.” App. 92, 146. Because the partnerships had\n“no business purpose other than tax avoidance,” the IRS\nsaid, they “lacked economic substance”—or, put more\nstarkly, they were “sham[s]”—so the IRS would disregard\nthem for tax purposes and disallow the related losses.\nIbid. And because there were no valid partnerships for\ntax purposes, the IRS determined that the partners had\n                    Cite as: 571 U.

S. C. §6662(b)(3).\n   Woods, as the tax-matters partner for both partner­\nships, sought judicial review of the FPAAs pursuant to\n§6226(a). The District Court held that the partner-\nships were properly disregarded as shams but that the\nvaluation-misstatement penalty did not apply. The Govern­\nment appealed the decision on the penalty to the Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit. While the appeal was pend­\ning, the Fifth Circuit held in a similar case that, under\nCircuit precedent, the valuation-misstatement penalty\ndoes not apply when the relevant transaction is disregarded\nfor lacking economic substance.

District-Court Jurisdiction \n\n                              A\n\n   We begin with a brief explanation of the statutory\nscheme for dealing with partnership-related tax matters.\nA partnership does not pay federal income taxes; instead,\nits taxable income and losses pass through to the partners.\n26 U. S. C. §701. A partnership must report its tax items\non an information return, §6031(a), and the partners must\nreport their distributive shares of the partnership’s tax\nitems on their own individual returns, §§702, 704.\n   Before 1982, the IRS had no way of correcting errors on\na partnership’s return in a single, unified proceeding.\nInstead, tax matters pertaining to all the members of a\npartnership were dealt with just like tax matters pertain­\ning only to a single taxpayer: through deficiency proceed­\nings at the individual-taxpayer level.        See generally\n§§6211–6216 (2006 ed. and Supp. V). Deficiency proceed­\nings require the IRS to issue a separate notice of deficien­\ncy to each taxpayer, §6212(a) (2006 ed.), who can file a\npetition in the Tax Court disputing the alleged deficiency\nbefore paying it, §6213(a). Having to use deficiency pro­\nceedings for partnership-related tax matters led to du­\nplicative proceedings and the potential for inconsistent\ntreatment of partners in the same partnership. Congress\naddressed those difficulties by enacting the Tax Treatment\nof Partnership Items Act of 1982, as Title IV of the Tax\nEquity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). 96\nStat. 648 (codified as amended at 26 U. S. C. §§6221–6232\n(2006 ed. and Supp. V)).\n   Under TEFRA, partnership-related tax matters are\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naddressed in two stages. First, the IRS must initiate\nproceedings at the partnership level to adjust “partnership\nitems,” those relevant to the partnership as a whole.\n§§6221, 6231(a)(3). It must issue an FPAA notifying the\npartners of any adjustments to partnership items,\n§6223(a)(2), and the partners may seek judicial review of\nthose adjustments, §6226(a)–(b). Once the adjustments to\npartnership items have become final, the IRS may under­\ntake further proceedings at the partner level to make any\nresulting “computational adjustments” in the tax liability\nof the individual partners. §6231(a)(6). Most computa­\ntional adjustments may be directly assessed against the\npartners, bypassing deficiency proceedings and permitting\nthe partners to challenge the assessments only in post­\npayment refund actions. §6230(a)(1), (c). Deficiency\nproceedings are still required, however, for certain com­\nputational adjustments that are attributable to “affected\nitems,” that is, items that are affected by (but are not\nthemselves) partnership items.           §§6230(a)(2)(A)(i),\n6231(a)(5).\n                              B\n   Under the TEFRA framework, a court in a partnership­\nlevel proceeding like this one has jurisdiction to determine\nnot just partnership items, but also “the applicability of\nany penalty . . . which relates to an adjustment to a part­\nnership item.” §6226(f). As both sides agree, a determina­\ntion that a partnership lacks economic substance is an\nadjustment to a partnership item. Thus, the jurisdictional\nquestion here boils down to whether the valuation­\nmisstatement penalty “relates to” the determination that\nthe partnerships Woods and McCombs created were\nshams.\n   The Government’s theory of why the penalty was trig­\ngered is based on a straightforward relationship between\nthe economic-substance determination and the penalty. In\n8                UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Government’s view, there can be no outside basis in a\nsham partnership (which, for tax purposes, does not exist),\nso any partner who underpaid his individual taxes by\ndeclaring an outside basis greater than zero committed a\nvaluation misstatement. In other words, the penalty flows\nlogically and inevitably from the economic-substance\ndetermination.\n   Woods, however, argues that because outside basis is\nnot a partnership item, but an affected item, a penalty\nthat would rest on a misstatement of outside basis cannot\nbe considered at the partnership level. He maintains, in\nshort, that a penalty does not relate to a partnership-item\nadjustment if it “requires a partner-level determination,”\nregardless of “whether or not the penalty has a connection\nto a partnership item.” Brief for Respondent 27.\n   Because §6226(f)’s “relates to” language is “essentially\nindeterminate,” we must resolve this dispute by looking to\n“the structure of [TEFRA] and its other provisions.” Mar-\nacich v. Spears, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9)\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). That\ninquiry makes clear that the District Court’s jurisdiction\nis not as narrow as Woods contends. Prohibiting courts in\npartnership-level proceedings from considering the ap­\nplicability of penalties that require partner-level inquiries\nwould be inconsistent with the nature of the “applicabil­\nity” determination that TEFRA requires.\n   Under TEFRA’s two-stage structure, penalties for tax\nunderpayment must be imposed at the partner level,\nbecause partnerships themselves pay no taxes. And im­\nposing a penalty always requires some determinations\nthat can be made only at the partner level. Even where a\npartnership’s return contains significant errors, a partner\nmay not have carried over those errors to his own return;\nor if he did, the errors may not have caused him to under­\npay his taxes by a large enough amount to trigger the\npenalty; or if they did, the partner may nonetheless have\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nacted in good faith with reasonable cause, which is a bar\nto the imposition of many penalties, see §6664(c)(1). None\nof those issues can be conclusively determined at the\npartnership level. Yet notwithstanding that every pen­\nalty must be imposed in partner-level proceedings after\npartner-level determinations, TEFRA provides that the\napplicability of some penalties must be determined at\nthe partnership level. The applicability determination is\ntherefore inherently provisional; it is always contingent\nupon determinations that the court in a partnership-level\nproceeding does not have jurisdiction to make. Barring\npartnership-level courts from considering the applicability\nof penalties that cannot be imposed without partner-level\ninquiries would render TEFRA’s authorization to consider\nsome penalties at the partnership level meaningless.\n   Other provisions of TEFRA confirm that conclusion.\nOne requires the IRS to use deficiency proceedings for\ncomputational adjustments that rest on “affected items\nwhich require partner level determinations (other than\npenalties . . . that relate to adjustments to partnership\nitems).” §6230(a)(2)(A)(i). Another states that while a\npartnership-level determination “concerning the applica­\nbility of any penalty . . . which relates to an adjustment\nto a partnership item” is “conclusive” in a subsequent re­\nfund action, that does not prevent the partner from “as­\nsert[ing] any partner level defenses that may apply.”\n§6230(c)(4). Both these provisions assume that a penalty can\nrelate to a partnership-item adjustment even if the penalty\ncannot be imposed without additional, partner-level\ndeterminations.\n   These considerations lead us to reject Woods’ interpreta­\ntion of §6226(f). We hold that TEFRA gives courts in\npartnership-level proceedings jurisdiction to determine the\napplicability of any penalty that could result from an\nadjustment to a partnership item, even if imposing the\npenalty would also require determining affected or non­\n10               UNITED STATES v.

The partnership­\nlevel applicability determination, we stress, is provisional:\nthe court may decide only whether adjustments properly\nmade at the partnership level have the potential to trigger\nthe penalty.

Applicability of Valuation-Misstatement Penalty\n                               A\n  Taxpayers who underpay their taxes due to a “valuation\nmisstatement” may incur an accuracy-related penalty. A\n20-percent penalty applies to “the portion of any under­\npayment which is attributable to . . . [a]ny substantial\nvaluation misstatement under chapter 1.” 26 U. S. C.\n§6662(a), (b)(3). Under the version of the penalty statute\nin effect when the transactions at issue here occurred,\n     “there is a substantial valuation misstatement under\n     chapter 1 if . . . the value of any property (or the ad­\n     justed basis of any property) claimed on any return of\n     tax imposed by chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the\n     amount determined to be the correct amount of such\n     valuation or adjusted basis (as the case may be).”\n     §6662(e)(1)(A) (2000 ed.).\nIf the reported value or adjusted basis exceeds the correct\n——————\n   2 Some amici warn that our holding bodes an odd procedural result:\n\nThe IRS will be able to assess the 40-percent penalty directly, but it\nwill have to use deficiency proceedings to assess the tax underpayment\nupon which the penalty is imposed. See Brief for New Millennium\nTrading, LLC, et al. as Amici Curiae 12–13. That criticism assumes\nthat the underpayment would not be exempt from deficiency proceed­\nings because it would rest on outside basis, an “affected ite[m] . . . other\nthan [a] penalt[y],” 26 U. S. C. §6230(a)(2)(A)(i). We need not resolve\nthat question today, but we do not think amici’s answer necessarily\nfollows. Even an underpayment attributable to an affected item is\nexempt so long as the affected item does not “require partner level\ndeterminations,” ibid.; see Bush v. United States, 655 F. 3d 1323, 1330,\n1333–1334 (CA Fed. 2011) (en banc); and it is not readily apparent\nwhy additional partner-level determinations would be required before\nadjusting outside basis in a sham partnership. Cf. Petaluma FX\nPartners, LLC v. Commissioner, 591 F. 3d 649, 655 (CADC 2010)\n(“If disregarding a partnership leads ineluctably to the conclusion that\nits partners have no outside basis, that should be just as obvious in\npartner-level proceedings as it is in partnership-level proceedings”).\n12                   UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\namount by at least 400 percent, the valuation misstate­\nment is considered not merely substantial, but “gross,”\nand the penalty increases to 40 percent. §6662(h).3\n  The penalty’s plain language makes it applicable here.\nAs we have explained, the COBRA transactions were\ndesigned to generate losses by enabling the partners to\nclaim a high outside basis in the partnerships. But once\nthe partnerships were deemed not to exist for tax purposes,\nno partner could legitimately claim an outside basis\ngreater than zero. Accordingly, if a partner used an out­\nside basis figure greater than zero to claim losses on his\ntax return, and if deducting those losses caused the part­\nner to underpay his taxes, then the resulting underpay­\nment would be “attributable to” the partner’s having\nclaimed an “adjusted basis” in the partnerships that ex­\nceeded “the correct amount of such . . . adjusted basis.”\n§6662(e)(1)(A).\n  An IRS regulation provides that when an asset’s true\nvalue or adjusted basis is zero, “[t]he value or adjusted\nbasis claimed . . . is considered to be 400 percent or more\nof the correct amount,” so that the resulting valuation\nmisstatement is automatically deemed gross and subject\nto the 40-percent penalty.

Reg. §1.6662–5(g), 26\nCFR §1.6662–5(g) (2013).4\n                               B\n     Against this straightforward application of the statute,\n——————\n  3 Congress has since lowered the thresholds for substantial and gross\n\nmisstatements to 150 percent and 200 percent, respectively.

See Brief for Prof. Amandeep\nS. Grewal as Amicus Curiae 20, n. 7; cf. Lee’s Summit v. Surface\nTransp. Bd., 231 F. 3d 39, 41–42 (CADC 2000) (discussing “problems\nposed by applying [a] 100% increase standard to a baseline of zero”).\nWoods has not challenged the regulation before this Court, so we\nassume its validity for purposes of deciding this case.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWoods’ primary argument is that the economic-substance\ndetermination did not result in a “valuation misstate­\nment.” He asserts that the statutory terms “value” and\n“valuation” connote “a factual—rather than legal—\nconcept,” and that the penalty therefore applies only to\nfactual misrepresentations about an asset’s worth or cost,\nnot to misrepresentations that rest on legal errors (like\nthe use of a sham partnership). Brief for Respondent 35.\n  We are not convinced. To begin, we doubt that “value”\nis limited to factual issues and excludes threshold legal\ndeterminations. Cf. Powers v. Commissioner, 312 U. S.\n259, 260 (1941) (“[W]hat criterion should be employed for\ndetermining the ‘value’ of the gifts is a question of law”);\nChapman Glen Ltd. v. Commissioner, 140 T. C. No. 15,\n2013 WL2319282, *17 (2013) (“[T]hree approaches are\nused to determine the fair market value of property,” and\n“which approach to apply in a case is a question of law”).\nBut even if “value” were limited to factual matters, the\nstatute refers to “value” or “adjusted basis,” and there is\nno justification for extending that limitation to the latter\nterm, which plainly incorporates legal inquiries. An as­\nset’s “basis” is simply its cost, 26 U. S. C. §1012(a) (2006\ned., Supp. V), but calculating its “adjusted basis” requires\nthe application of a host of legal rules, see §§1011(a) (2006\ned.), 1016 (2006 ed. and Supp. V), including specialized\nrules for calculating the adjusted basis of a partner’s\ninterest in a partnership, see §705 (2006 ed.). The statute\ncontains no indication that the misapplication of one of\nthose legal rules cannot trigger the penalty. Were we to\nhold otherwise, we would read the word “adjusted” out of\nthe statute.\n  To overcome the plain meaning of “adjusted basis,”\nWoods asks us to interpret the parentheses in the statutory\nphrase “the value of any property (or the adjusted basis of\nany property)” as a signal that “adjusted basis” is merely\nexplanatory or illustrative and has no meaning inde­\n14                UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npendent of “value.” The parentheses cannot bear that\nmuch weight, given the compelling textual evidence to the\ncontrary. For one thing, the terms reappear later in the\nsame sentence sans parentheses—in the phrase “such\nvaluation or adjusted basis.” Moreover, the operative\nterms are connected by the conjunction “or.” While that\ncan sometimes introduce an appositive—a word or phrase\nthat is synonymous with what precedes it (“Vienna or\nWien,” “Batman or the Caped Crusader”)—its ordinary\nuse is almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it\nconnects are to “be given separate meanings.” Reiter v.\nSonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 339 (1979). And, of course,\nthere is no way that “adjusted basis” could be regarded as\nsynonymous with “value.” Finally, the terms’ second\ndisjunctive appearance is followed by “as the case may be,”\nwhich eliminates any lingering doubt that the preceding\nitems are alternatives. See New Oxford American Dic­\ntionary 269 (3d ed. 2010). The parentheses thus do not\njustify “rob[bing] the term [‘adjusted basis’] of its inde­\npendent and ordinary significance.” Reiter, supra, at\n338–339.\n   Our holding that the valuation-misstatement penalty\nencompasses legal as well as factual misstatements of\nadjusted basis does not make superfluous the new penalty\nthat Congress enacted in 2010 for transactions lacking in\neconomic substance, see §1409(b)(2), 124 Stat. 1068–1069\n(codified at 26 U. S. C. §6662(b)(6) (2006 ed., Supp. V)).\nThe new penalty covers all sham transactions, including\nthose that do not cause the taxpayer to misrepresent value\nor basis; thus, it can apply in situations where the valuation­\nmisstatement penalty cannot. And the fact that both\npenalties are potentially applicable to sham transactions\nresulting in valuation misstatements is not problematic.\nCongress recognized that penalties might overlap in a\ngiven case, and it addressed that possibility by providing\nthat a taxpayer generally cannot receive more than one\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

See\n§6662(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. V).5\n                              C\n  In the alternative, Woods argues that any underpay­\nment of tax in this case would be “attributable,” not to\nthe misstatements of outside basis, but rather to the deter­\nmination that the partnerships were shams—which he\ndescribes as an “independent legal ground.” Brief for\nRespondent 46. That is the rationale that the Fifth\nand Ninth Circuits have adopted for refusing to apply\nthe valuation-misstatement penalty in cases like this,\nalthough both courts have voiced doubts about it. See\nBemont, 679 F. 3d, at 347–348; id., at 351–355 (Prado, J.,\nconcurring); Keller v. Commissioner, 556 F. 3d 1056, 1060–\n1061 (CA9 2009).\n  We reject the argument’s premise: The economic­\nsubstance determination and the basis misstatement are\nnot “independent” of one another. This is not a case where\na valuation misstatement is a mere side effect of a sham\ntransaction. Rather, the overstatement of outside basis\nwas the linchpin of the COBRA tax shelter and the mech­\nanism by which Woods and McCombs sought to reduce\ntheir taxable income. As Judge Prado observed, in this\ntype of tax shelter, “the basis misstatement and the trans­\naction’s lack of economic substance are inextricably inter­\ntwined,” so “attributing the tax underpayment only to the\nartificiality of the transaction and not to the basis over­\n\n——————\n  5 We  do not consider Woods’ arguments based on legislative history.\nWhether or not legislative history is ever relevant, it need not be\nconsulted when, as here, the statutory text is unambiguous. Mohamad\nv. Palestinian Authority, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8). Nor\ndo we evaluate the claim that application of the penalty to legal rather\nthan factual misrepresentations is a recent innovation. An agency’s\nfailure to assert a power, even if prolonged, cannot alter the plain\nmeaning of a statute.\n16               UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvaluation is making a false distinction.” Bemont, supra, at\n354 (concurring opinion). In short, the partners underpaid\ntheir taxes because they overstated their outside basis,\nand they overstated their outside basis because the part­\nnerships were shams. We therefore have no difficulty\nconcluding that any underpayment resulting from the\nCOBRA tax shelter is attributable to the partners’ misrep­\nresentation of outside basis (a valuation misstatement).\n   Woods contends, however, that a document known as\nthe “Blue Book” compels a different result. See General\nExplanation of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981\n(Pub. L. 97–34), 97 Cong., 1st Sess., 333, and n. 2 (Jt.\nComm. Print 1980). Blue Books are prepared by the staff\nof the Joint Committee on Taxation as commentaries on\nrecently passed tax laws. They are “written after passage\nof the legislation and therefore d[o] not inform the deci­\nsions of the members of Congress who vot[e] in favor of the\n[law].” Flood v. United States, 33 F. 3d 1174, 1178 (CA9\n1994). We have held that such “[p]ost-enactment legisla­\ntive history (a contradiction in terms) is not a legitimate\ntool of statutory interpretation.” Bruesewitz v. Wyeth\nLLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 17–18); accord,\nFederal Nat. Mortgage Assn. v. United States, 379 F. 3d\n1303, 1309 (CA Fed. 2004) (dismissing Blue Book as\n“a post-enactment explanation”). While we have relied on\nsimilar documents in the past, see FPC v. Memphis Light,\nGas & Water Div., 411 U. S. 458, 471–472 (1973), our more\nrecent precedents disapprove of that practice. Of course\nthe Blue Book, like a law review article, may be relevant\nto the extent it is persuasive. But the passage at issue\nhere does not persuade. It concerns a situation quite\ndifferent from the one we confront: two separate, non­\noverlapping underpayments, only one of which is attribut­\nable to a valuation misstatement.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Argued October 9, 2013—Decided December 3, 2013\nRespondent Gary Woods and his employer, Billy Joe McCombs, partici-\n  pated in an offsetting-option tax shelter designed to generate large\n  paper losses that they could use to reduce their taxable income. To\n  that end, they purchased from Deutsche Bank a series of currency-\n  option spreads. Each spread was a package consisting of a long op-\n  tion, which Woods and McCombs purchased from Deutsche Bank and\n  for which they paid a premium, and a short option, which Woods and\n  McCombs sold to Deutsche Bank and for which they received a pre-\n  mium. Because the premium paid for the long option was largely off-\n  set by the premium received for the short option, the net cost of the\n  package to Woods and McCombs was substantially less than the cost\n  of the long option alone. Woods and McCombs contributed the\n  spreads, along with cash, to two partnerships, which used the cash to\n  purchase stock and currency. When calculating their basis in the\n  partnership interests, Woods and McCombs considered only the long\n  component of the spreads and disregarded the nearly offsetting short\n  component. As a result, when the partnerships’ assets were disposed\n  of for modest gains, Woods and McCombs claimed huge losses. Al-\n  though they had contributed roughly $3.2 million in cash and spreads\n  to the partnerships, they claimed losses of more than $45 million.\n     The Internal Revenue Service sent each partnership a Notice of\n  Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment, disregarding the\n  partnerships for tax purposes and disallowing the related losses. It\n  concluded that the partnerships were formed for the purpose of tax\n  avoidance and thus lacked “economic substance,” i.e., they were\n  shams. As there were no valid partnerships for tax purposes, the IRS\n  determined that the partners could not claim a basis for their part-\n  nership interests greater than zero and that any resulting tax under-\n2                     UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    payments would be subject to a 40-percent penalty for gross valua-\n    tion misstatements. Woods sought judicial review. The District\n    Court held that the partnerships were properly disregarded as shams\n    but that the valuation-misstatement penalty did not apply. The Fifth\n    Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The District Court had jurisdiction to determine whether the\n partnerships’ lack of economic substance could justify imposing a\n valuation-misstatement penalty on the partners. Pp. 6–11.\n       (a) Because a partnership does not pay federal income taxes, its\n taxable income and losses pass through to the partners. Under the\n Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), the IRS\n initiates partnership-related tax proceedings at the partnership level\n to adjust “partnership items,” i.e., items relevant to the partnership\n as a whole. 26 U. S. C. §§6221, 6231(a)(3). Once the adjustments be-\n come final, the IRS may undertake further proceedings at the part-\n ner level to make any resulting “computational adjustments” in the\n tax liability of the individual partners.         §§6230(a)(1)–(2), (c),\n 6231(a)(6). Pp. 6–7.\n       (b) Under TEFRA’s framework, a court in a partnership-level\n proceeding has jurisdiction to determine “the applicability of any\n penalty . . . which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.”\n §6226(f). A determination that a partnership lacks economic sub-\n stance is such an adjustment. TEFRA authorizes courts in partner-\n ship-level proceedings to provisionally determine the applicability of\n any penalty that could result from an adjustment to a partnership\n item, even though imposing the penalty requires a subsequent, part-\n ner-level proceeding. In that later proceeding, each partner may\n raise any reasons why the penalty may not be imposed on him specif-\n ically. Applying those principles here, the District Court had juris-\n diction to determine the applicability of the valuation-misstatement\n penalty. Pp. 7–11.\n    2. The valuation-misstatement penalty applies in this case.\n Pp. 11–16.\n       (a) A penalty applies to the portion of any underpayment that is\n “attributable to” a “substantial” or “gross” “valuation misstatement,”\n which exists where “the value of any property (or the adjusted basis\n of any property) claimed on any return of tax” exceeds by a specified\n percentage “the amount determined to be the correct amount of such\n valuation or adjusted basis (as the case may be).” §§6662(a), (b)(3),\n (e)(1)(A), (h). The penalty’s plain language makes it applicable here.\n Once the partnerships were deemed not to exist for tax purposes, no\n partner could legitimately claim a basis in his partnership interest\n greater than zero. Any underpayment resulting from use of a non-\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

And un-\n  der the relevant Treasury Regulation, when an asset’s adjusted basis\n  is zero, a valuation misstatement is automatically deemed gross.\n  Pp. 11–12.\n      (b) Woods’ contrary arguments are unpersuasive. The valuation-\n  misstatement penalty encompasses misstatements that rest on legal\n  as well as factual errors, so it is applicable to misstatements that rest\n  on the use of a sham partnership. And the partnerships’ lack of eco-\n  nomic substance is not an independent ground separate from the\n  misstatement of basis in this case. Pp. 12–16.\n471 Fed.

The Facts\n                             A\n  This case involves an offsetting-option tax shelter, vari­\nants of which were marketed to high-income taxpayers in\nthe late 1990’s. Tax shelters of this type sought to gener­\nate large paper losses that a taxpayer could use to reduce\ntaxable income. They did so by attempting to give the tax­\npayer an artificially high basis in a partnership interest,\nwhich enabled the taxpayer to claim a significant tax loss\nupon disposition of the interest. See IRS Notice 2000–44,\n2000–2 Cum. Bull. 255 (describing offsetting-option tax\nshelters).\n  The particular tax shelter at issue in this case was\ndeveloped by the now-defunct law firm Jenkens &\nGilchrist and marketed by the accounting firm Ernst &\n2                 UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nYoung under the name “Current Options Bring Reward\nAlternatives,” or COBRA. Respondent Gary Woods and\nhis employer, Billy Joe McCombs, agreed to participate in\nCOBRA to reduce their tax liability for 1999. To that end,\nin November 1999 they created two general partnerships:\none, Tesoro Drive Partners, to produce ordinary losses,\nand the other, SA Tesoro Investment Partners, to produce\ncapital losses.\n   Over the next two months, acting through their respec­\ntive wholly owned, limited liability companies, Woods and\nMcCombs executed a series of transactions. First, they\npurchased from Deutsche Bank five 30-day currency­\noption spreads. Each of these option spreads was a pack­\nage consisting of a so-called long option, which entitled\nWoods and McCombs to receive a sum of money from\nDeutsche Bank if a certain currency exchange rate ex­\nceeded a certain figure on a certain date, and a so-called\nshort option, which entitled Deutsche Bank to receive a\nsum of money from Woods and McCombs if the exchange\nrate for the same currency on the same date exceeded a\ncertain figure so close to the figure triggering the long\noption that both were likely to be triggered (or not to be\ntriggered) on the fated date. Because the premium paid to\nDeutsche Bank for purchase of the long option was largely\noffset by the premium received from Deutsche Bank for\nsale of the short option, the net cost of the package to\nWoods and McCombs was substantially less than the cost\nof the long option alone. Specifically, the premiums paid\nfor all five of the spreads’ long options totaled $46 million,\nand the premiums received for the five spreads’ short\noptions totaled $43.7 million, so the net cost of the spreads\nwas just $2.3 million. Woods and McCombs contributed\nthe spreads to the partnerships along with about $900,000\nin cash. The partnerships used the cash to purchase\nassets—Canadian dollars for the partnership that sought\nto produce ordinary losses, and Sun Microsystems stock\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor the partnership that sought to produce capital losses.\nThe partnerships then terminated the five option spreads\nin exchange for a lump-sum payment from Deutsche\nBank.\n  As the tax year drew to a close, Woods and McCombs\ntransferred their interests in the partnerships to two S\ncorporations. One corporation, Tesoro Drive Investors,\nInc., received both partners’ interests in Tesoro Drive\nPartners; the other corporation, SA Tesoro Drive Inves­\ntors, Inc., received both partners’ interests in SA Tesoro\nInvestment Partners. Since this left each partnership\nwith only a single partner (the relevant S corporation), the\npartnerships were liquidated by operation of law, and\ntheir assets—the Canadian dollars and Sun Microsystems\nstock, plus the remaining cash—were deemed distributed\nto the corporations. The corporations then sold those\nassets for modest gains of about $2,000 on the Canadian\ndollars and about $57,000 on the stock. But instead of\ngains, the corporations reported huge losses: an ordinary\nloss of more than $13 million on the sale of the Canadian\ndollars and a capital loss of more than $32 million on the\nsale of the stock. The losses were allocated between\nWoods and McCombs as the corporations’ co-owners.\n  The reason the corporations were able to claim such vast\nlosses—the alchemy at the heart of an offsetting-options\ntax shelter—lay in how Woods and McCombs calculated\nthe tax basis of their interests in the partnerships. Tax\nbasis is the amount used as the cost of an asset when\ncomputing how much its owner gained or lost for tax\npurposes when disposing of it. See J. Downes & J. Good­\nman, Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms 736\n(2010). A partner’s tax basis in a partnership interest—\ncalled “outside basis” to distinguish it from “inside basis,”\nthe partnership’s basis in its own assets—is tied to the\nvalue of any assets the partner contributed to acquire the\ninterest. See 26 U. S. C. §722. Collectively, Woods and\n4                UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMcCombs contributed roughly $3.2 million in option\nspreads and cash to acquire their interests in the two\npartnerships. But for purposes of computing outside\nbasis, Woods and McCombs considered only the long\ncomponent of the spreads and disregarded the nearly offset­\nting short component on the theory that it was “too con­\ntingent” to count. Brief for Respondent 14. As a result,\nthey claimed a total adjusted outside basis of more than\n$48 million. Since the basis of property distributed to a\npartner by a liquidating partnership is equal to the ad­\njusted basis of the partner’s interest in the partnership\n(reduced by any cash distributed with the property), see\n§732(b), the inflated outside basis figure was carried over\nto the S corporations’ basis in the Canadian dollars and\nthe stock, enabling the corporations to report enormous\nlosses when those assets were sold. At the end of the day,\nWoods’ and McCombs’ $3.2 million investment generated\ntax losses that, if treated as valid, could have shielded\nmore than $45 million of income from taxation.\n                              B\n  The Internal Revenue Service, however, did not treat\nthe COBRA-generated losses as valid. Instead, after\nauditing the partnerships’ tax returns, it issued to each\npartnership a Notice of Final Partnership Administrative\nAdjustment, or “FPAA.” In the FPAAs, the IRS deter­\nmined that the partnerships had been “formed and availed\nof solely for purposes of tax avoidance by artificially over­\nstating basis in the partnership interests of [the] purported\npartners.” App. 92, 146. Because the partnerships had\n“no business purpose other than tax avoidance,” the IRS\nsaid, they “lacked economic substance”—or, put more\nstarkly, they were “sham[s]”—so the IRS would disregard\nthem for tax purposes and disallow the related losses.\nIbid. And because there were no valid partnerships for\ntax purposes, the IRS determined that the partners had\n                    Cite as: 571 U.

The District Court held that the partner-\nships were properly disregarded as shams but that the\nvaluation-misstatement penalty did not apply.

District-Court Jurisdiction \n\n                              A\n\n   We begin with a brief explanation of the statutory\nscheme for dealing with partnership-related tax matters.\nA partnership does not pay federal income taxes; instead,\nits taxable income and losses pass through to the partners.\n26 U. S. C. §701. A partnership must report its tax items\non an information return, §6031(a), and the partners must\nreport their distributive shares of the partnership’s tax\nitems on their own individual returns, §§702, 704.\n   Before 1982, the IRS had no way of correcting errors on\na partnership’s return in a single, unified proceeding.\nInstead, tax matters pertaining to all the members of a\npartnership were dealt with just like tax matters pertain­\ning only to a single taxpayer: through deficiency proceed­\nings at the individual-taxpayer level.        See generally\n§§6211–6216 (2006 ed. and Supp. V). Deficiency proceed­\nings require the IRS to issue a separate notice of deficien­\ncy to each taxpayer, §6212(a) (2006 ed.), who can file a\npetition in the Tax Court disputing the alleged deficiency\nbefore paying it, §6213(a). Having to use deficiency pro­\nceedings for partnership-related tax matters led to du­\nplicative proceedings and the potential for inconsistent\ntreatment of partners in the same partnership. Congress\naddressed those difficulties by enacting the Tax Treatment\nof Partnership Items Act of 1982, as Title IV of the Tax\nEquity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). 96\nStat. 648 (codified as amended at 26 U. S. C. §§6221–6232\n(2006 ed. and Supp. V)).\n   Under TEFRA, partnership-related tax matters are\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naddressed in two stages. First, the IRS must initiate\nproceedings at the partnership level to adjust “partnership\nitems,” those relevant to the partnership as a whole.\n§§6221, 6231(a)(3). It must issue an FPAA notifying the\npartners of any adjustments to partnership items,\n§6223(a)(2), and the partners may seek judicial review of\nthose adjustments, §6226(a)–(b). Once the adjustments to\npartnership items have become final, the IRS may under­\ntake further proceedings at the partner level to make any\nresulting “computational adjustments” in the tax liability\nof the individual partners. §6231(a)(6). Most computa­\ntional adjustments may be directly assessed against the\npartners, bypassing deficiency proceedings and permitting\nthe partners to challenge the assessments only in post­\npayment refund actions. §6230(a)(1), (c). Deficiency\nproceedings are still required, however, for certain com­\nputational adjustments that are attributable to “affected\nitems,” that is, items that are affected by (but are not\nthemselves) partnership items.           §§6230(a)(2)(A)(i),\n6231(a)(5).\n                              B\n   Under the TEFRA framework, a court in a partnership­\nlevel proceeding like this one has jurisdiction to determine\nnot just partnership items, but also “the applicability of\nany penalty . . . which relates to an adjustment to a part­\nnership item.” §6226(f). As both sides agree, a determina­\ntion that a partnership lacks economic substance is an\nadjustment to a partnership item. Thus, the jurisdictional\nquestion here boils down to whether the valuation­\nmisstatement penalty “relates to” the determination that\nthe partnerships Woods and McCombs created were\nshams.\n   The Government’s theory of why the penalty was trig­\ngered is based on a straightforward relationship between\nthe economic-substance determination and the penalty. In\n8                UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Government’s view, there can be no outside basis in a\nsham partnership (which, for tax purposes, does not exist),\nso any partner who underpaid his individual taxes by\ndeclaring an outside basis greater than zero committed a\nvaluation misstatement. In other words, the penalty flows\nlogically and inevitably from the economic-substance\ndetermination.\n   Woods, however, argues that because outside basis is\nnot a partnership item, but an affected item, a penalty\nthat would rest on a misstatement of outside basis cannot\nbe considered at the partnership level. He maintains, in\nshort, that a penalty does not relate to a partnership-item\nadjustment if it “requires a partner-level determination,”\nregardless of “whether or not the penalty has a connection\nto a partnership item.” Brief for Respondent 27.\n   Because §6226(f)’s “relates to” language is “essentially\nindeterminate,” we must resolve this dispute by looking to\n“the structure of [TEFRA] and its other provisions.” Mar-\nacich v. Spears, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9)\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). That\ninquiry makes clear that the District Court’s jurisdiction\nis not as narrow as Woods contends. Prohibiting courts in\npartnership-level proceedings from considering the ap­\nplicability of penalties that require partner-level inquiries\nwould be inconsistent with the nature of the “applicabil­\nity” determination that TEFRA requires.\n   Under TEFRA’s two-stage structure, penalties for tax\nunderpayment must be imposed at the partner level,\nbecause partnerships themselves pay no taxes. And im­\nposing a penalty always requires some determinations\nthat can be made only at the partner level. Even where a\npartnership’s return contains significant errors, a partner\nmay not have carried over those errors to his own return;\nor if he did, the errors may not have caused him to under­\npay his taxes by a large enough amount to trigger the\npenalty; or if they did, the partner may nonetheless have\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nacted in good faith with reasonable cause, which is a bar\nto the imposition of many penalties, see §6664(c)(1). None\nof those issues can be conclusively determined at the\npartnership level. Yet notwithstanding that every pen­\nalty must be imposed in partner-level proceedings after\npartner-level determinations, TEFRA provides that the\napplicability of some penalties must be determined at\nthe partnership level. The applicability determination is\ntherefore inherently provisional; it is always contingent\nupon determinations that the court in a partnership-level\nproceeding does not have jurisdiction to make. Barring\npartnership-level courts from considering the applicability\nof penalties that cannot be imposed without partner-level\ninquiries would render TEFRA’s authorization to consider\nsome penalties at the partnership level meaningless.\n   Other provisions of TEFRA confirm that conclusion.\nOne requires the IRS to use deficiency proceedings for\ncomputational adjustments that rest on “affected items\nwhich require partner level determinations (other than\npenalties . . . that relate to adjustments to partnership\nitems).” §6230(a)(2)(A)(i). Another states that while a\npartnership-level determination “concerning the applica­\nbility of any penalty . . . which relates to an adjustment\nto a partnership item” is “conclusive” in a subsequent re­\nfund action, that does not prevent the partner from “as­\nsert[ing] any partner level defenses that may apply.”\n§6230(c)(4). Both these provisions assume that a penalty can\nrelate to a partnership-item adjustment even if the penalty\ncannot be imposed without additional, partner-level\ndeterminations.\n   These considerations lead us to reject Woods’ interpreta­\ntion of §6226(f). We hold that TEFRA gives courts in\npartnership-level proceedings jurisdiction to determine the\napplicability of any penalty that could result from an\nadjustment to a partnership item, even if imposing the\npenalty would also require determining affected or non­\n10               UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npartnership items such as outside basis. The partnership­\nlevel applicability determination, we stress, is provisional:\nthe court may decide only whether adjustments properly\nmade at the partnership level have the potential to trigger\nthe penalty. Each partner remains free to raise, in subse­\nquent, partner-level proceedings, any reasons why the\npenalty may not be imposed on him specifically.\n   Applying the foregoing principles to this case, we con­\nclude that the District Court had jurisdiction to determine\nthe applicability of the valuation-misstatement penalty—\nto determine, that is, whether the partnerships’ lack of\neconomic substance (which all agree was properly decided\nat the partnership level) could justify imposing a valua­\ntion-misstatement penalty on the partners. When making\nthat determination, the District Court was obliged to\nconsider Woods’ arguments that the economic-substance\ndetermination was categorically incapable of triggering\nthe penalty. Deferring consideration of those arguments\nuntil partner-level proceedings would replicate the precise\nevil that TEFRA sets out to remedy: duplicative proceed­\nings, potentially leading to inconsistent results, on a ques­\ntion that applies equally to all of the partners.\n   To be sure, the District Court could not make a formal ad­\njustment of any partner’s outside basis in this partnership­\nlevel proceeding. See Petaluma, 591 F. 3d, at 655. But\nit nonetheless could determine whether the adjustments\nit did make, including the economic-substance deter­\nmination, had the potential to trigger a penalty; and in\ndoing so, it was not required to shut its eyes to the legal\nimpossibility of any partner’s possessing an outside basis\ngreater than zero in a partnership that, for tax purposes,\ndid not exist. Each partner’s outside basis still must be\nadjusted at the partner level before the penalty can be\nimposed, but that poses no obstacle to a partnership-level\ncourt’s provisional consideration of whether the economic­\nsubstance determination is legally capable of triggering\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

Applicability of Valuation-Misstatement Penalty\n                               A\n  Taxpayers who underpay their taxes due to a “valuation\nmisstatement” may incur an accuracy-related penalty. A\n20-percent penalty applies to “the portion of any under­\npayment which is attributable to . . . [a]ny substantial\nvaluation misstatement under chapter 1.” 26 U. S. C.\n§6662(a), (b)(3). Under the version of the penalty statute\nin effect when the transactions at issue here occurred,\n     “there is a substantial valuation misstatement under\n     chapter 1 if . . . the value of any property (or the ad­\n     justed basis of any property) claimed on any return of\n     tax imposed by chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the\n     amount determined to be the correct amount of such\n     valuation or adjusted basis (as the case may be).”\n     §6662(e)(1)(A) (2000 ed.).\nIf the reported value or adjusted basis exceeds the correct\n——————\n   2 Some amici warn that our holding bodes an odd procedural result:\n\nThe IRS will be able to assess the 40-percent penalty directly, but it\nwill have to use deficiency proceedings to assess the tax underpayment\nupon which the penalty is imposed. See Brief for New Millennium\nTrading, LLC, et al. as Amici Curiae 12–13. That criticism assumes\nthat the underpayment would not be exempt from deficiency proceed­\nings because it would rest on outside basis, an “affected ite[m] . . . other\nthan [a] penalt[y],” 26 U. S. C. §6230(a)(2)(A)(i). We need not resolve\nthat question today, but we do not think amici’s answer necessarily\nfollows. Even an underpayment attributable to an affected item is\nexempt so long as the affected item does not “require partner level\ndeterminations,” ibid.; see Bush v. United States, 655 F. 3d 1323, 1330,\n1333–1334 (CA Fed. 2011) (en banc); and it is not readily apparent\nwhy additional partner-level determinations would be required before\nadjusting outside basis in a sham partnership. Cf. Petaluma FX\nPartners, LLC v. Commissioner, 591 F. 3d 649, 655 (CADC 2010)\n(“If disregarding a partnership leads ineluctably to the conclusion that\nits partners have no outside basis, that should be just as obvious in\npartner-level proceedings as it is in partnership-level proceedings”).\n12                   UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\namount by at least 400 percent, the valuation misstate­\nment is considered not merely substantial, but “gross,”\nand the penalty increases to 40 percent. §6662(h).3\n  The penalty’s plain language makes it applicable here.\nAs we have explained, the COBRA transactions were\ndesigned to generate losses by enabling the partners to\nclaim a high outside basis in the partnerships. But once\nthe partnerships were deemed not to exist for tax purposes,\nno partner could legitimately claim an outside basis\ngreater than zero. Accordingly, if a partner used an out­\nside basis figure greater than zero to claim losses on his\ntax return, and if deducting those losses caused the part­\nner to underpay his taxes, then the resulting underpay­\nment would be “attributable to” the partner’s having\nclaimed an “adjusted basis” in the partnerships that ex­\nceeded “the correct amount of such . . . adjusted basis.”\n§6662(e)(1)(A).\n  An IRS regulation provides that when an asset’s true\nvalue or adjusted basis is zero, “[t]he value or adjusted\nbasis claimed . . . is considered to be 400 percent or more\nof the correct amount,” so that the resulting valuation\nmisstatement is automatically deemed gross and subject\nto the 40-percent penalty.

S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWoods’ primary argument is that the economic-substance\ndetermination did not result in a “valuation misstate­\nment.” He asserts that the statutory terms “value” and\n“valuation” connote “a factual—rather than legal—\nconcept,” and that the penalty therefore applies only to\nfactual misrepresentations about an asset’s worth or cost,\nnot to misrepresentations that rest on legal errors (like\nthe use of a sham partnership). Brief for Respondent 35.\n  We are not convinced. To begin, we doubt that “value”\nis limited to factual issues and excludes threshold legal\ndeterminations. Cf. Powers v. Commissioner, 312 U. S.\n259, 260 (1941) (“[W]hat criterion should be employed for\ndetermining the ‘value’ of the gifts is a question of law”);\nChapman Glen Ltd. v. Commissioner, 140 T. C. No. 15,\n2013 WL2319282, *17 (2013) (“[T]hree approaches are\nused to determine the fair market value of property,” and\n“which approach to apply in a case is a question of law”).\nBut even if “value” were limited to factual matters, the\nstatute refers to “value” or “adjusted basis,” and there is\nno justification for extending that limitation to the latter\nterm, which plainly incorporates legal inquiries. An as­\nset’s “basis” is simply its cost, 26 U. S. C. §1012(a) (2006\ned., Supp. V), but calculating its “adjusted basis” requires\nthe application of a host of legal rules, see §§1011(a) (2006\ned.), 1016 (2006 ed. and Supp. V), including specialized\nrules for calculating the adjusted basis of a partner’s\ninterest in a partnership, see §705 (2006 ed.). The statute\ncontains no indication that the misapplication of one of\nthose legal rules cannot trigger the penalty. Were we to\nhold otherwise, we would read the word “adjusted” out of\nthe statute.\n  To overcome the plain meaning of “adjusted basis,”\nWoods asks us to interpret the parentheses in the statutory\nphrase “the value of any property (or the adjusted basis of\nany property)” as a signal that “adjusted basis” is merely\nexplanatory or illustrative and has no meaning inde­\n14                UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npendent of “value.” The parentheses cannot bear that\nmuch weight, given the compelling textual evidence to the\ncontrary. For one thing, the terms reappear later in the\nsame sentence sans parentheses—in the phrase “such\nvaluation or adjusted basis.” Moreover, the operative\nterms are connected by the conjunction “or.” While that\ncan sometimes introduce an appositive—a word or phrase\nthat is synonymous with what precedes it (“Vienna or\nWien,” “Batman or the Caped Crusader”)—its ordinary\nuse is almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it\nconnects are to “be given separate meanings.” Reiter v.\nSonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 339 (1979). And, of course,\nthere is no way that “adjusted basis” could be regarded as\nsynonymous with “value.” Finally, the terms’ second\ndisjunctive appearance is followed by “as the case may be,”\nwhich eliminates any lingering doubt that the preceding\nitems are alternatives. See New Oxford American Dic­\ntionary 269 (3d ed. 2010). The parentheses thus do not\njustify “rob[bing] the term [‘adjusted basis’] of its inde­\npendent and ordinary significance.” Reiter, supra, at\n338–339.\n   Our holding that the valuation-misstatement penalty\nencompasses legal as well as factual misstatements of\nadjusted basis does not make superfluous the new penalty\nthat Congress enacted in 2010 for transactions lacking in\neconomic substance, see §1409(b)(2), 124 Stat. 1068–1069\n(codified at 26 U. S. C. §6662(b)(6) (2006 ed., Supp. V)).\nThe new penalty covers all sham transactions, including\nthose that do not cause the taxpayer to misrepresent value\nor basis; thus, it can apply in situations where the valuation­\nmisstatement penalty cannot. And the fact that both\npenalties are potentially applicable to sham transactions\nresulting in valuation misstatements is not problematic.\nCongress recognized that penalties might overlap in a\ngiven case, and it addressed that possibility by providing\nthat a taxpayer generally cannot receive more than one\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

That is the rationale that the Fifth\nand Ninth Circuits have adopted for refusing to apply\nthe valuation-misstatement penalty in cases like this,\nalthough both courts have voiced doubts about it. See\nBemont, 679 F. 3d, at 347–348; id., at 351–355 (Prado, J.,\nconcurring); Keller v. Commissioner, 556 F. 3d 1056, 1060–\n1061 (CA9 2009).\n  We reject the argument’s premise: The economic­\nsubstance determination and the basis misstatement are\nnot “independent” of one another. This is not a case where\na valuation misstatement is a mere side effect of a sham\ntransaction. Rather, the overstatement of outside basis\nwas the linchpin of the COBRA tax shelter and the mech­\nanism by which Woods and McCombs sought to reduce\ntheir taxable income. As Judge Prado observed, in this\ntype of tax shelter, “the basis misstatement and the trans­\naction’s lack of economic substance are inextricably inter­\ntwined,” so “attributing the tax underpayment only to the\nartificiality of the transaction and not to the basis over­\n\n——————\n  5 We  do not consider Woods’ arguments based on legislative history.\nWhether or not legislative history is ever relevant, it need not be\nconsulted when, as here, the statutory text is unambiguous.

Nor\ndo we evaluate the claim that application of the penalty to legal rather\nthan factual misrepresentations is a recent innovation. An agency’s\nfailure to assert a power, even if prolonged, cannot alter the plain\nmeaning of a statute.\n16               UNITED STATES v. WOODS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvaluation is making a false distinction.” Bemont, supra, at\n354 (concurring opinion). In short, the partners underpaid\ntheir taxes because they overstated their outside basis,\nand they overstated their outside basis because the part­\nnerships were shams. We therefore have no difficulty\nconcluding that any underpayment resulting from the\nCOBRA tax shelter is attributable to the partners’ misrep­\nresentation of outside basis (a valuation misstatement).\n   Woods contends, however, that a document known as\nthe “Blue Book” compels a different result. See General\nExplanation of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981\n(Pub. L. 97–34), 97 Cong., 1st Sess., 333, and n. 2 (Jt.\nComm. Print 1980). Blue Books are prepared by the staff\nof the Joint Committee on Taxation as commentaries on\nrecently passed tax laws. They are “written after passage\nof the legislation and therefore d[o] not inform the deci­\nsions of the members of Congress who vot[e] in favor of the\n[law].” Flood v. United States, 33 F. 3d 1174, 1178 (CA9\n1994). We have held that such “[p]ost-enactment legisla­\ntive history (a contradiction in terms) is not a legitimate\ntool of statutory interpretation.” Bruesewitz v. Wyeth\nLLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 17–18); accord,\nFederal Nat. Mortgage Assn. v. United States, 379 F. 3d\n1303, 1309 (CA Fed. 2004) (dismissing Blue Book as\n“a post-enactment explanation”). While we have relied on\nsimilar documents in the past, see FPC v. Memphis Light,\nGas & Water Div., 411 U. S. 458, 471–472 (1973), our more\nrecent precedents disapprove of that practice. Of course\nthe Blue Book, like a law review article, may be relevant\nto the extent it is persuasive. But the passage at issue\nhere does not persuade. It concerns a situation quite\ndifferent from the one we confront: two separate, non­\noverlapping underpayments, only one of which is attribut­\nable to a valuation misstatement.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.
