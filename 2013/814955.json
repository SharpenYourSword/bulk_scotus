Argued December 4, 2012—Decided January 8, 2013\nPetitioner Los Angeles County Flood Control District (District) operates\n  a “municipal separate storm sewer system” (MS4), a drainage system\n  that collects, transports, and discharges storm water. Because storm\n  water is often heavily polluted, the Clean Water Act (CWA) and its\n  implementing regulations require certain MS4 operators to obtain a\n  National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit\n  before discharging storm water into navigable waters. The District\n  has such a permit for its MS4. Respondents Natural Resources De-\n  fense Council, Inc. (NRDC) and Santa Monica Baykeeper (Baykeeper)\n  filed a citizen suit against the District and others under §505 of the\n  CWA, 33 U. S. C. §1365, alleging, among other things, that water-\n  quality measurements from monitoring stations within the Los Ange-\n  les and San Gabriel Rivers demonstrated that the District was violat-\n  ing the terms of its permit. The District Court granted summary\n  judgment to the District on these claims, concluding that the record\n  was insufficient to warrant a finding that the MS4 had discharged\n  storm water containing the standards-exceeding pollutants detected\n  at the downstream monitoring stations. The Ninth Circuit reversed\n  in relevant part. The court held that the District was liable for the\n  discharge of pollutants that, in the court’s view, occurred when the\n  polluted water detected at the monitoring stations flowed out of the\n  concrete-lined portions of the rivers, where the monitoring stations\n  are located, into lower, unlined portions of the same rivers.\nHeld: The flow of water from an improved portion of a navigable wa-\n terway into an unimproved portion of the same waterway does not\n2         LOS ANGELES COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL DIST. v.\n          NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL, INC.\n\n                          Syllabus\n\n\n    qualify as a “discharge of a pollutant” under the CWA. See South\n    Fla. Water Management Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe, 541 U. S. 95, 109–\n    112 (holding that the transfer of polluted water between “two parts of\n    the same water body” does not constitute a discharge of pollutants\n    under the CWA). The Ninth Circuit’s decision cannot be squared\n    with this holding.\n      The NRDC and Baykeeper alternatively argue that, based on the\n    terms of the District’s NPDES permit, the exceedances detected at\n    the monitoring stations sufficed to establish the District’s liability\n    under the CWA for its upstream discharges. This argument, which\n    failed below, is not embraced within the narrow question on which\n    certiorari was granted.

S. C. §1251 et seq., does the flow of\nwater out of a concrete channel within a river rank as a\n“discharge of a pollutant”? In this Court, the parties and\nthe United States as amicus curiae agree that the answer\nto this question is “no.” They base this accord on South\nFla. Water Management Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe, 541\nU. S. 95, 109–112 (2004), in which we accepted that pump-\ning polluted water from one part of a water body into\nanother part of the same body is not a discharge of pol-\nlutants under the CWA. Adhering to the view we took in\nMiccosukee, we hold that the parties correctly answered\nthe sole question presented in the negative. The decision\nin this suit rendered by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit is inconsistent with our determination. We there-\nfore reverse that court’s judgment.\n  Petitioner Los Angeles County Flood Control District\n(District) operates a “municipal separate storm sewer\n2      LOS ANGELES COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL DIST. v.\n       NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL, INC.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsystem” (MS4)—a drainage system that collects, trans-\nports, and discharges storm water.            See 40 CFR\n§122.26(b)(8) (2012). See also §122.26(b)(13) (“Storm\nwater means storm water runoff, snow melt runoff, and\nsurface runoff and drainage.”). Because storm water is\noften heavily polluted, see 64 Fed. Reg. 68724–68727\n(1999), the CWA and its implementing regulations require\nthe operator of an MS4 serving a population of at least\n100,000 to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimina-\ntion System (NPDES) permit before discharging storm\nwater into navigable waters. See 33 U. S. C. §§1311(a),\n1342(p)(2)(C), and (D); 40 CFR §§122.26(a)(3), (b)(4), (b)(7).\nThe District first obtained a NPDES permit for its MS4 in\n1990; thereafter, the permit was several times renewed.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. County of Los\nAngeles, 673 F. 3d 880, 886 (CA9 2011).\n   Respondents Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.\n(NRDC) and Santa Monica Baykeeper (Baykeeper) filed\na citizen suit against the District and several other de-\nfendants under §505 of the CWA, 33 U. S. C. §1365. They\nalleged, among other things, that water-quality measure-\nments from monitoring stations located within the Los\nAngeles and San Gabriel Rivers demonstrated that the\nDistrict was violating the terms of its permit.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment to the\nDistrict on these claims. It was undisputed, the District\nCourt acknowledged, that “data from the Los Angeles\nRiver and San Gabriel River [monitoring] stations indi-\ncate[d] that water quality standards ha[d] repeatedly been\nexceeded for a number of pollutants, including aluminum,\ncopper, cyanide, fecal coliform bacteria, and zinc.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 108. But numerous entities other than the\nDistrict, the court added, discharge into the rivers up-\nstream of the monitoring stations. See id., at 115–116.\nSee also 673 F. 3d, at 889 (observing that the pollutants of\n“thousands of permitted dischargers” reach the rivers).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe record was insufficient, the District Court concluded,\nto warrant a finding that the District’s MS4 had dis-\ncharged storm water containing the standards-exceeding\npollutants detected at the downstream monitoring\nstations.\n   The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part. The moni-\ntoring stations for the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Riv-\ners, the Court of Appeals said, are located in “concrete\nchannels” constructed for flood-control purposes. Id., at\n900. See also id., at 889 (describing the monitoring\nstations’ location). Based on this impression, the Court of\nAppeals held that a discharge of pollutants occurred under\nthe CWA when the polluted water detected at the monitor-\ning stations “flowed out of the concrete channels” and\nentered downstream portions of the waterways lacking\nconcrete linings. Id., at 900. Because the District exer-\ncises control over the concrete-lined portions of the rivers,\nthe Court of Appeals held, the District is liable for the\ndischarges that, in the appellate court’s view, occur when\nwater exits those concrete channels. See id., at 899–901.\n   We granted certiorari on the following question: Under\nthe CWA, does a “discharge of pollutants” occur when\npolluted water “flows from one portion of a river that is\nnavigable water of the United States, through a concrete\nchannel or other engineered improvement in the river,”\nand then “into a lower portion of the same river”? Pet.\nfor Cert. i. See 567 U. S. ___ (2012). As noted above,\nsee supra, at 1, the parties, as well as the United States\nas amicus curiae, agree that the answer to this question\nis “no.”\n   That agreement is hardly surprising, for we held in\nMiccosukee that the transfer of polluted water between\n“two parts of the same water body” does not constitute a\ndischarge of pollutants under the CWA. 541 U. S., at 109–\n112. We derived that determination from the CWA’s text,\nwhich defines the term “discharge of a pollutant” to mean\n4       LOS ANGELES COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL DIST. v.\n        NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n“any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from\nany point source.” 33 U. S. C. §1362(12) (emphasis added).\nUnder a common understanding of the meaning of the\nword “add,” no pollutants are “added” to a water body\nwhen water is merely transferred between different por-\ntions of that water body. See Webster’s Third New Inter-\nnational Dictionary 24 (2002) (“add” means “to join, annex,\nor unite (as one thing to another) so as to bring about\nan increase (as in number, size, or importance) or so as to\nform one aggregate”). “As the Second Circuit [aptly] put it\n. . . , ‘[i]f one takes a ladle of soup from a pot, lifts it above\nthe pot, and pours it back into the pot, one has not “added”\nsoup or anything else to the pot.’ ” Miccosukee, 541 U. S.,\nat 109–110 (quoting Catskill Mountains Chapter of Trout\nUnlimited, Inc. v. New York, 273 F. 3d 481, 492 (CA2\n2001)).\n    In Miccosukee, polluted water was removed from a ca-\nnal, transported through a pump station, and then de-\nposited into a nearby reservoir. 541 U. S., at 100. We\nheld that this water transfer would count as a discharge of\npollutants under the CWA only if the canal and the reser-\nvoir were “meaningfully distinct water bodies.” Id., at\n112. It follows, a fortiori, from Miccosukee that no dis-\ncharge of pollutants occurs when water, rather than being\nremoved and then returned to a water body, simply flows\nfrom one portion of the water body to another. We hold,\ntherefore, that the flow of water from an improved portion\nof a navigable waterway into an unimproved portion of\nthe very same waterway does not qualify as a discharge of\npollutants under the CWA. Because the decision below\ncannot be squared with that holding, the Court of Appeals’\njudgment must be reversed.1\n——————\n  1 The NRDC, Baykeeper, and the United States contend—contrary to\n\nthe District—that the Court of Appeals understood that no discharge of\npollutants occurs when water flows from an improved into an unim-\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Under the per-\nmit’s terms, the NRDC and Baykeeper maintain, the ex-\nceedances detected at the instream monitoring stations\nare by themselves sufficient to establish the District’s\nliability under the CWA for its upstream discharges. See\nBrief for Respondents 33–62.2 This argument failed be-\nlow. See 673 F. 3d, at 898, 901; App. to Pet. for Cert. 100–\n102. It is not embraced within, or even touched by,\nthe narrow question on which we granted certiorari. We\ntherefore do not address, and indicate no opinion on, the\nissue the NRDC and Baykeeper seek to substitute for the\nquestion we took up for review.\n                      *    *      *\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO concurs in the judgment.\n——————\nproved portion of a navigable waterway. They suggest that the Court of\nAppeals misperceived the facts, erroneously believing that the monitor-\ning stations for the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers “were sampling\nwater from a portion of the MS4 that was distinct from the rivers\nthemselves and from which discharges through an outfall to the rivers\nsubsequently occurred.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18.\nSee also Brief for Respondents 30–31 (“The court of appeals’ statements\nsuggest it believed the monitoring stations sampled polluted storm-\nwater from the District’s MS4 before, not after, discharge to the Los\nAngeles and San Gabriel Rivers.”). Whatever the source of the Court of\nAppeals’ error, all parties agree that the court’s analysis was erroneous.\n  2 Shortly before oral argument in this case, a renewed permit was\n\napproved for the District’s MS4. Unlike the District’s prior permit,\nwhich required only instream monitoring, the renewed permit requires\nend-of-pipe monitoring at individual MS4 discharge points.

The moni-\ntoring stations for the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Riv-\ners, the Court of Appeals said, are located in “concrete\nchannels” constructed for flood-control purposes. Id., at\n900. See also id., at 889 (describing the monitoring\nstations’ location). Based on this impression, the Court of\nAppeals held that a discharge of pollutants occurred under\nthe CWA when the polluted water detected at the monitor-\ning stations “flowed out of the concrete channels” and\nentered downstream portions of the waterways lacking\nconcrete linings. Id., at 900. Because the District exer-\ncises control over the concrete-lined portions of the rivers,\nthe Court of Appeals held, the District is liable for the\ndischarges that, in the appellate court’s view, occur when\nwater exits those concrete channels. See id., at 899–901.\n   We granted certiorari on the following question: Under\nthe CWA, does a “discharge of pollutants” occur when\npolluted water “flows from one portion of a river that is\nnavigable water of the United States, through a concrete\nchannel or other engineered improvement in the river,”\nand then “into a lower portion of the same river”? Pet.\nfor Cert. i. See 567 U. S. ___ (2012). As noted above,\nsee supra, at 1, the parties, as well as the United States\nas amicus curiae, agree that the answer to this question\nis “no.”\n   That agreement is hardly surprising, for we held in\nMiccosukee that the transfer of polluted water between\n“two parts of the same water body” does not constitute a\ndischarge of pollutants under the CWA. 541 U. S., at 109–\n112. We derived that determination from the CWA’s text,\nwhich defines the term “discharge of a pollutant” to mean\n4       LOS ANGELES COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL DIST. v.\n        NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n“any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from\nany point source.” 33 U. S. C. §1362(12) (emphasis added).\nUnder a common understanding of the meaning of the\nword “add,” no pollutants are “added” to a water body\nwhen water is merely transferred between different por-\ntions of that water body. See Webster’s Third New Inter-\nnational Dictionary 24 (2002) (“add” means “to join, annex,\nor unite (as one thing to another) so as to bring about\nan increase (as in number, size, or importance) or so as to\nform one aggregate”). “As the Second Circuit [aptly] put it\n. . . , ‘[i]f one takes a ladle of soup from a pot, lifts it above\nthe pot, and pours it back into the pot, one has not “added”\nsoup or anything else to the pot.’ ” Miccosukee, 541 U. S.,\nat 109–110 (quoting Catskill Mountains Chapter of Trout\nUnlimited, Inc. v. New York, 273 F. 3d 481, 492 (CA2\n2001)).\n    In Miccosukee, polluted water was removed from a ca-\nnal, transported through a pump station, and then de-\nposited into a nearby reservoir. 541 U. S., at 100. We\nheld that this water transfer would count as a discharge of\npollutants under the CWA only if the canal and the reser-\nvoir were “meaningfully distinct water bodies.” Id., at\n112. It follows, a fortiori, from Miccosukee that no dis-\ncharge of pollutants occurs when water, rather than being\nremoved and then returned to a water body, simply flows\nfrom one portion of the water body to another. We hold,\ntherefore, that the flow of water from an improved portion\nof a navigable waterway into an unimproved portion of\nthe very same waterway does not qualify as a discharge of\npollutants under the CWA. Because the decision below\ncannot be squared with that holding, the Court of Appeals’\njudgment must be reversed.1\n——————\n  1 The NRDC, Baykeeper, and the United States contend—contrary to\n\nthe District—that the Court of Appeals understood that no discharge of\npollutants occurs when water flows from an improved into an unim-\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Under the per-\nmit’s terms, the NRDC and Baykeeper maintain, the ex-\nceedances detected at the instream monitoring stations\nare by themselves sufficient to establish the District’s\nliability under the CWA for its upstream discharges. See\nBrief for Respondents 33–62.2 This argument failed be-\nlow. See 673 F. 3d, at 898, 901; App. to Pet. for Cert. 100–\n102. It is not embraced within, or even touched by,\nthe narrow question on which we granted certiorari. We\ntherefore do not address, and indicate no opinion on, the\nissue the NRDC and Baykeeper seek to substitute for the\nquestion we took up for review.\n                      *    *      *\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO concurs in the judgment.\n——————\nproved portion of a navigable waterway. They suggest that the Court of\nAppeals misperceived the facts, erroneously believing that the monitor-\ning stations for the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers “were sampling\nwater from a portion of the MS4 that was distinct from the rivers\nthemselves and from which discharges through an outfall to the rivers\nsubsequently occurred.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18.\nSee also Brief for Respondents 30–31 (“The court of appeals’ statements\nsuggest it believed the monitoring stations sampled polluted storm-\nwater from the District’s MS4 before, not after, discharge to the Los\nAngeles and San Gabriel Rivers.”). Whatever the source of the Court of\nAppeals’ error, all parties agree that the court’s analysis was erroneous.\n  2 Shortly before oral argument in this case, a renewed permit was\n\napproved for the District’s MS4. Unlike the District’s prior permit,\nwhich required only instream monitoring, the renewed permit requires\nend-of-pipe monitoring at individual MS4 discharge points.
