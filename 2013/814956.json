VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 10–930.      Argued October 9, 2012—Decided January 8, 2013*\nRespondent Valencia Gonzales, a death row inmate in Arizona, sought\n  federal habeas relief. His counsel moved to stay the proceedings,\n  contending that Gonzales’ mental incompetence prevented him from\n  rationally communicating with or assisting counsel, and that Gonza-\n  les was thus entitled to a stay because, under the Ninth Circuit’s Ro-\n  han decision, what is now 18 U. S. C. §3599(a)(2) requires a stay\n  when a petitioner is adjudged incompetent. The District Court de-\n  nied a stay, finding that the claims before it were record based or re-\n  solvable as a matter of law and thus would not benefit from Gonzales’\n  input. Gonzales thereafter sought a writ of mandamus in the Ninth\n  Circuit. Applying Rohan and its recent decision in Nash—which\n  gave habeas petitioners a right to competence even on record-based\n  appeals—the court granted the writ, concluding that §3599 gave\n  Gonzales the right to a stay pending a competency determination.\n     Respondent Sean Carter, a death row inmate in Ohio, initiated\n  federal habeas proceedings but eventually moved for a competency\n  determination and stay of the proceedings. The District Court grant-\n  ed the motion and found Carter incompetent to assist counsel. Ap-\n  plying the Ninth Circuit’s Rohan test, it determined that Carter’s as-\n  sistance was required to develop four of his exhausted claims. It thus\n  dismissed his habeas petition without prejudice and prospectively\n  tolled the statute of limitations. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit, relying\n  in part on Rees v. Peyton, 384 U. S. 312 (Rees I), located a statutory\n  right to competence in 18 U. S. C. §4241, and found that a court could\n——————\n  * Together with No. 11–218, Tibbals, Warden v.

VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    employ that provision whenever a capital habeas petitioner seeks to\n    forgo his petition. It thus ordered that Carter’s petition be stayed in-\n    definitely with respect to any claims requiring his assistance.\nHeld:\n    1. Section 3599 does not provide a state prisoner a right to suspen-\n sion of his federal habeas proceedings when he is adjudged incompe-\n tent. Pp. 5–12.\n       (a) The assertion of such a right lacks any basis in the provision’s\n text. Section 3599 guarantees federal habeas petitioners on death\n row the right to federally funded counsel, §3599(a)(2), and sets out\n various requirements that appointed counsel must meet, §§3599(b)–\n (e), but it does not direct district courts to stay proceedings when pe-\n titioners are found incompetent. The assertion is also difficult to\n square with the Court’s constitutional precedents. If the Sixth\n Amendment right carried with it an implied right to competence, the\n right to competence at trial would flow from that Amendment, not\n from the right to due process, see Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U. S. 348,\n 354. But while the benefits flowing from the right to counsel at trial\n could be affected if an incompetent defendant is unable to communi-\n cate with his attorney, this Court has never said that the right to\n competence derives from the right to counsel. And the Court will not\n assume or infer that Congress intended to depart from such prece-\n dent and locate a right to competence in federal habeas proceedings\n within the right to counsel. See Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S.\n ___, ___. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) The Ninth Circuit identified its rule in Rohan, concluding\n there that a petitioner’s mental incompetency could “eviscerate the\n statutory right to counsel” in federal habeas proceedings. But given\n the backward-looking, record-based nature of §2254 proceedings,\n counsel can generally provide effective representation to a habeas pe-\n titioner regardless of the petitioner’s competence. Rees I, supra, Rees\n v. Peyton, 386 U. S. 989, and Rees v. Superintendent of the Va. State\n Penitentiary, 516 U. S 802, which involved an incompetent death row\n inmate’s attempt to withdraw his certiorari petition, offer no support\n for federal habeas petitioners seeking to stay district court proceed-\n ings or for the Ninth Circuit’s opinions in Rohan, Nash, or this case.\n The Ninth Circuit’s interpretation is also not supported by McFar-\n land v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 858, in which this Court held that a dis-\n trict court could stay an execution after a capital prisoner had in-\n voked his right to counsel but before he had filed his habeas petition.\n In contrast, Gonzales is seeking to stay the District Court’s proceed-\n ings, and he sought a stay more than six years after initiating his\n habeas petition, certainly ample time for his attorney to research and\n present the claims.

Section 4241 also does not provide a statutory right to compe-\n  tence during federal habeas proceedings. The Sixth Circuit based its\n  conclusion largely on a misreading of Rees I, which did not recognize\n  such a right. Moreover, §4241 does not even apply to habeas proceed-\n  ings. By its terms, it applies only to trial proceedings prior to sen-\n  tencing and “at any time after the commencement of probation or su-\n  pervised release.” Federal habeas proceedings, however, commence\n  after sentencing, and federal habeas petitioners are incarcerated, not\n  on probation. Furthermore, §4241, like the rest of Title 18 generally,\n  applies exclusively to federal defendants, not to state prisoners like\n  Carter. Finally, §4241(a) authorizes a district court to grant a motion\n  for a competency determination if there is reasonable cause to believe\n  that the defendant’s mental incompetence renders him “unable to\n  understand . . . the proceedings against him or to assist properly in\n  his defense,” while a §2254 habeas proceeding is a civil action against\n  a state-prison warden, in which the petitioner collaterally attacks his\n  conviction in an earlier state trial. Pp. 12–14.\n     3. For purposes of resolving these cases, it is sufficient to address\n  the outer limits of the district court’s discretion to issue stays; it is\n  unnecessary to determine the precise contours of that discretion. In\n  Gonzales’ case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in deny-\n  ing a stay after finding that Gonzales’ claims were all record based or\n  resolvable as a matter of law, regardless of his competence. Review\n  of a petitioner’s record-based claims subject to §2254(d) is limited to\n  the record before the state court that heard the case on the merits.\n  Any evidence that Gonzales might have would be inadmissible. In\n  Carter’s case, three of his claims do not warrant a stay because they\n  were adjudicated on the merits in state postconviction proceedings\n  and thus subject to review under §2254(d). Thus, extrarecord evi-\n  dence that he might have concerning these claims would be inadmis-\n  sible. It is unclear from the record whether he exhausted his fourth\n  claim. If it was exhausted, it too would be record based. But even if\n  it was both unexhausted and not procedurally defaulted, an indefi-\n  nite stay would be inappropriate, since such a stay would permit pe-\n  titioners to “frustrate [the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\n  Act of 1996’s] goal of finality by dragging out indefinitely their feder-\n  al habeas review.” Rhines v.

We hold\nthat neither 18 U. S. C. §3599 nor 18 U. S. C. §4241 pro-\nvides such a right and that the Courts of Appeals for the\nNinth and Sixth Circuits both erred in holding that dis-\ntrict courts must stay federal habeas proceedings when\npetitioners are adjudged incompetent.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n   Ernest Valencia Gonzales was convicted by an Arizona\njury of felony murder, armed robbery, aggravated assault,\nfirst-degree burglary, and theft. The convictions arose\n2              RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom Gonzales’ repeated stabbing of Darrel and Deborah\nWagner in front of their 7-year-old son during a burglary\nof the Wagners’ home. Darrel Wagner died from the stab-\nbing, while Deborah Wagner survived but spent five days\nin intensive care. The trial court sentenced Gonzales to\ndeath on the murder charge and to various prison terms\nfor the other crimes.\n   After exhausting state remedies, Gonzales filed a peti-\ntion for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court\non November 15, 1999. While the petition was pending,\nGonzales’ appointed counsel moved to stay the proceed-\nings, contending that Gonzales was no longer capable of\nrationally communicating with or assisting counsel. He\nargued that mental incompetence entitled Gonzales to a\nstay under Ninth Circuit precedent. See Rohan v. Wood-\nford, 334 F. 3d 803 (2003). In Rohan, the Ninth Circuit\nheld that the federal statute guaranteeing state capital\nprisoners a right to counsel in federal habeas proceedings,\n21 U. S. C. §848(q)(4)(B) (2000 ed.) (now codified as 18\nU. S. C. §3599(a)(2)), could not “be faithfully enforced\nunless courts ensure that a petitioner is competent,” 334\nF. 3d, at 813. Rohan thus concluded that “where an\nincompetent capital habeas petitioner raises claims that\ncould potentially benefit from his ability to communicate\nrationally, refusing to stay proceedings pending restora-\ntion of competence denies him his statutory right to assis-\ntance of counsel, whether or not counsel can identify with\nprecision the information sought.” Id., at 819.\n   Applying Rohan, the District Court denied a stay after\nconcluding that the claims properly before it were record\nbased or resolvable as a matter of law and thus would not\nbenefit from Gonzales’ input. The court found it unnec-\nessary to determine whether Gonzales was incompetent,\nthough it did find that he possessed “at least a limited\ncapacity for rational communication.” Gonzales v.

While Gonzales’\npetition was pending, the Ninth Circuit decided Nash v.\nRyan, 581 F. 3d 1048 (2009), which held that habeas\npetitioners have a right to competence on appeal, even\nthough appeals are entirely record based. Id., at 1050\n(“While an appeal is record-based, that does not mean\nthat a habeas petitioner in a capital case is relegated to\na nonexistent role. Meaningful assistance of appellate\ncounsel may require rational communication between\ncounsel and a habeas petitioner”). Applying Nash and\nRohan, the court granted the writ of mandamus, conclud-\ning that even though Gonzales’ “exhausted claims are\nrecord-based or legal in nature, he is entitled to a stay\npending a competency determination” under 18 U. S. C.\n§3599. In re Gonzales, 623 F. 3d 1242, 1244 (2010).\n  We granted certiorari to determine whether §3599\nprovides a statutory right to competence in federal habeas\nproceedings. 565 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                              B\n  Sean Carter was convicted by an Ohio jury of aggra-\nvated murder, aggravated robbery, and rape, and sen-\ntenced to death for anally raping his adoptive grandmother,\nVeader Prince, and stabbing her to death. After exhaust-\ning his state-court appeals, Carter initiated federal habeas\nproceedings on March 19, 2002, in the Northern District of\nOhio. Carter eventually filed a third amended petition,\nalong with a motion requesting a competency determi-\nnation and a stay of the proceedings. The District Court\ngranted the motion.\n  Following several psychiatric evaluations and a com-\npetency determination, the District Court found Carter\nincompetent to assist counsel. Applying the Ninth Cir-\ncuit’s test in Rohan, it determined that Carter’s assistance\nwas required to develop four of his exhausted claims. As a\n4                 RYAN v.

The State appealed.\n   The Sixth Circuit acknowledged that “[f]ederal habeas\npetitioners facing the death penalty for state criminal\nconvictions do not enjoy a constitutional right to compe-\ntence.” Carter v. Bradshaw, 644 F. 3d 329, 332 (2011). It\nnevertheless located a statutory right to competence in\n§4241, relying, in part, on this Court’s decision in Rees v.\nPeyton, 384 U. S. 312 (1966) (per curiam) (Rees I ).1 644\nF. 3d, at 332. The Sixth Circuit explained:\n       “By applying section 4241 to habeas actions, Rees\n     addresses the situation where a habeas petitioner\n     awaiting the death penalty may seek to forego any\n     collateral attacks on his conviction or sentence, and\n     defines a statutory right for the petitioner to be com-\n     petent enough to (1) understand the nature and\n     consequences of the proceedings against him, and (2)\n     assist properly in his defense.” Id., at 333.\nThe court concluded that “[a]nytime a capital habeas\npetitioner affirmatively seeks to forego his habeas petition,\nwhether by action or inaction, . . . a district court may\nemploy section 4241.” Id., at 334.\n  The court therefore amended the District Court’s judg-\nment and ordered that Carter’s petition be stayed in-\ndefinitely with respect to any claims that required his\nassistance. Id., at 336–337. Judge Rogers dissented, arguing\nthat there was no constitutional or statutory basis for the\ncourt’s decision. Id., at 337–342.\n  We granted certiorari to determine whether §4241\nprovides a statutory right to competence in federal habeas\n——————\n  1 In Rees, we held indefinitely a petition for certiorari after an in-\n\ncompetent capital inmate sought to withdraw his petition prior to our\nreview. 384 U.

S. ___ (2012).\n                             II\n  Both the Ninth and Sixth Circuits have concluded that\ndeath row inmates pursuing federal habeas are entitled to\na suspension of proceedings when found incompetent. The\nNinth Circuit located this right in §3599, while the Sixth\nCircuit located it in §4241. Neither section provides such\na right.\n                              A\n   Section 3599(a)(2) guarantees federal habeas petitioners\non death row the right to federally funded counsel.2 The\nstatute provides that petitioners who are “financially\nunable to obtain adequate representation . . . shall be\nentitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys.”\nAppointed attorneys are required to have experience in\ndeath penalty litigation, §§3599(b)–(d), and, once appointed,\nare directed to “represent the defendant throughout\nevery subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings,”\n§3599(e). The statute also gives district courts the power\nto authorize funding for “investigative, expert, or other\nservices” as are “reasonably necessary for the representa-\ntion of the defendant.” §3599(f). But §3599 does not direct\ndistrict courts to stay proceedings when habeas petitioners\nare found incompetent.3\n——————\n  2 “In any postconviction proceeding under [28 U. S. C. §2254 or\n\n§2255], seeking to vacate or set aside a death sentence, any defendant\nwho is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation\nor investigative, expert, or other reasonably necessary services shall be\nentitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys and the furnishing\nof such other services in accordance with subsections (b) through (f ).”\n18 U. S. C. §3599(a)(2).\n  3 In fact, §3599(e), which contains the section’s sole reference to “com-\n\npetency,” cuts against the Ninth Circuit’s conclusion. That section\nprovides that appointed attorneys “shall also represent the defendant\nin such competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or other\nclemency as may be available to the defendant.” We doubt that Con-\n6                RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   In addition to lacking any basis in the statutory text,\nthe assertion that the right to counsel implies a right to\ncompetence is difficult to square with our constitutional\nprecedents. The right to counsel is located in the Sixth\nAmendment. (“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused\nshall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel\nfor his defence.”) If the right to counsel carried with it\nan implied right to competence, the right to competence\nat trial would flow from the Sixth Amendment. But “[w]e\nhave repeatedly and consistently recognized that ‘the\ncriminal trial of an incompetent defendant violates due\nprocess,’ ” not the Sixth Amendment. Cooper v. Oklahoma,\n517 U. S. 348, 354 (1996) (quoting Medina v. California,\n505 U. S. 437, 453 (1992); emphasis added); see also Drope\nv. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 172 (1975) (“[T]he failure to\nobserve procedures adequate to protect a defendant’s right\nnot to be tried or convicted while incompetent to stand\ntrial deprives him of his due process right to a fair trial”\n(citing Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 385 (1966))).\n   It stands to reason that the benefits flowing from the\nright to counsel at trial could be affected if an incompe-\ntent defendant is unable to communicate with his attorney.\nFor example, an incompetent defendant would be unable\nto assist counsel in identifying witnesses and deciding on\na trial strategy. For this reason, “[a] defendant may not\nbe put to trial unless he ‘ “has sufficient present ability to\nconsult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of ra-\ntional understanding . . . [and] a rational as well as factual\nunderstanding of the proceedings against him.” ’ ” Cooper,\nsupra, at 354 (quoting Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S.\n402 (1960) (per curiam)). Notwithstanding the connection\nbetween the right to competence at trial and the right to\ncounsel at trial, we have never said that the right to com-\n—————— \n\ngress would have authorized counsel to represent inmates in postcon-\nviction competency proceedings only if the inmates were competent. \n\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

We will not\nassume or infer that Congress intended to depart from our\nprecedents and locate a right to competence in federal\nhabeas proceedings within the right to counsel. “We nor-\nmally assume that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is\naware of relevant judicial precedent.” Merck & Co. v.\nReynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 12).\n   The Ninth Circuit located a statutory right to compe-\ntence in §3599. 623 F. 3d, at 1245 (citing Rohan, 334 F. 3d\n803, and Nash, 581 F. 3d 1048). Because Rohan is the\nNinth Circuit’s controlling precedent, we briefly address\nthat decision.\n   In Rohan, a habeas petitioner asserted a right to com-\npetency based both on the Due Process Clause and on 21\nU. S. C. §848(q)(4)(B) (2000 ed.). After discussing the\nhistory of the common law, which prohibited the indict-\nment, trial and execution of mentally incompetent defend-\nants,4 the Court of Appeals stated that the petitioner’s\ndue process claim raised “substantial” “constitutional ques-\ntions.” Rohan, 334 F. 3d, at 814. This conclusion is puz-\nzling in light of the Ninth Circuit’s acknowledgment that\nthere is “no constitutional right to counsel on habeas,” id.,\nat 810 (citing Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 10 (1989)\n(plurality opinion)), and that “there is no due process right\nto collateral review at all,” 334 F. 3d, at 810 (citing United\n——————\n  4 Blackstone   explained the common-law rule as follows:\n   “[I]f a man in his sound memory commits a capital offence, and before\narraignment for it, he becomes mad, he ought not to be arraigned for it;\nbecause he is not able to plead to it with that advice and caution that\nhe ought. And if, after he has pleaded, the prisoner becomes mad, he\nshall not be tried; for how can he make his defence? If, after he be tried\nand found guilty, he loses his senses before judgment, judgment shall\nnot be pronounced; and if, after judgment, he becomes of nonsane\nmemory, execution shall be stayed: for peradventure, says the human-\nity of the English law, had the prisoner been of sound memory, he might\nhave alleged something in stay of judgment or execution.” 4 W.

The Ninth Circuit was simply incorrect in\nsuggesting that, in this case, there might be a constitu-\ntional concern—much less a “substantial” one—raised by\nthe petitioner’s due process claim.\n   Invoking the canon of constitutional avoidance, the\nNinth Circuit gave the petitioner the practical benefit of\na due process right to competence in federal habeas pro-\nceedings through its interpretation of §848(q)(4)(B).5 334\nF. 3d, at 814. In analyzing that statute, the Rohan court\nrelied on a Ninth Circuit en banc opinion in Calderon v.\nUnited States Dist. Court for Central Dist. of Cal., 163\nF. 3d 530 (1998) (Kelly V), overruled in unrelated part,\nWoodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202 (2003), which held\nthat a prisoner’s incompetence is grounds for equitably\ntolling the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nof 1996’s (AEDPA) 1-year statute of limitations for filing\nhabeas petitions. The Rohan court purported to be bound\nby the “rationale” of Kelly V—that a prisoner’s incompe-\ntence could “eviscerate the statutory right to counsel,”6\n——————\n    5 As noted supra, at 2, §848(q)(4)(B) has been superseded by 18\nU. S. C. §3599(a)(2).\n  6 It is unclear how Kelly V’s determination that mental incompetence\n\nis grounds for AEDPA equitable tolling could possibly control the\noutcome in Rohan, which had nothing to do with AEDPA’s statute of\nlimitations. The relevant questions for equitable tolling purposes are\nwhether the petitioner has “ ‘been pursuing his rights diligently’ ” and\nwhether “ ‘some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.’ ” Hol-\nland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 16–17) (quoting\nPace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005)). But the propriety of\nequitably tolling AEDPA’s statute of limitations in the case of a men-\ntally incompetent petitioner has nothing to do with the statutory right to\ncounsel. The Ninth Circuit has held that habeas petitioners who do not\nhave a statutory right to counsel (i.e., all habeas petitioners other than\nthose on death row) may still avail themselves of equitable tolling if\nthey are mentally incompetent. See, e.g., Bills v. Clark, 628 F. 3d 1092,\n1097 (2010) (establishing standard for deciding equitable tolling claims\npredicated on mental incompetence); Laws v. Lamarque, 351 F. 3d 919,\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                  9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nKelly V, supra, at 541—and concluded that “[i]f a petition-\ner’s statutory rights depend on his ability to communicate\nrationally, compelling him to pursue relief while incompe-\ntent is no less an infringement than dismissing his late\npetition.” 334 F. 3d, at 814.\n   We are not persuaded by the Ninth Circuit’s assertion\nthat a habeas petitioner’s mental incompetency could “evis-\ncerate the statutory right to counsel” in federal habeas\nproceedings. Given the backward-looking, record-based\nnature of most federal habeas proceedings, counsel can\ngenerally provide effective representation to a habeas\npetitioner regardless of the petitioner’s competence. In-\ndeed, where a claim is “adjudicated on the merits in State\ncourt proceedings,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) (2006 ed.), counsel\nshould, in most circumstances, be able to identify whether\nthe “adjudication . . . resulted in a decision that was con-\ntrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States,” §2254(d)(1), without any evi-\ndence outside the record. See Cullen v. Pinholster, 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (“[R]eview under [28\nU. S. C.] §2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was\nbefore the state court that adjudicated the claim on the\nmerits. . . . This backward-looking language requires an\nexamination of the state-court decision at the time it was\nmade. It follows that the record under review is limited to\nthe record in existence at that same time—i.e., the record\nbefore the state court”). Attorneys are quite capable of\nreviewing the state-court record, identifying legal errors,\nand marshaling relevant arguments, even without their\nclients’ assistance.\n   Rohan also cited Rees I, 384 U. S. 312, in support of its\nconclusion. 334 F. 3d, at 815. In Rees I, a state inmate on\n—————— \n\n924–925 (2003) (recognizing that mental incompetence can give rise to\n\nequitable tolling for AEDPA’s statute of limitations).\n\n10                 RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndeath row filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nDistrict Court, alleging that the state-court conviction\nviolated his constitutional rights. 384 U. S., at 313. The\nDistrict Court denied his petition, and the Court of Ap-\npeals affirmed. Ibid. Shortly after Rees’ counsel filed a\npetition for certiorari with this Court, Rees directed his\ncounsel to withdraw the petition and to forgo any further\nproceedings. Counsel advised the Court that he could not\naccede to these instructions without a psychiatric evalua-\ntion of Rees, because there was some doubt as to Rees’\nmental competency. Ibid. In response, the Court directed\nthe District Court to determine Rees’ mental competence.\nId., at 313–314. After the District Court conducted a\nhearing and found Rees incompetent, the Court issued a\none-sentence order directing that the petition for certiorari\nbe “held without action.” Rees v. Peyton, 386 U. S. 989\n(1967) (Rees II ).7 When Rees died several decades later,\nthe Court dismissed the petition. Rees v. Superintendent\nof Va. State Penitentiary, 516 U. S. 802 (1995) (Rees III ).\n   The Ninth Circuit concluded that “[t]he record in Rees II\nshows that incompetence is grounds for staying habeas\nproceedings.” Rohan, supra, at 815. This conclusion is\nunwarranted. Rees I concerned whether an incompetent\nhabeas petitioner may withdraw his certiorari petition,\n——————\n  7 This order was issued after the Clerk of the Court spoke with the\n\nattorneys for Virginia and for the petitioner and proposed that the\nCourt hold the petition indefinitely. See Memorandum from John F.\nDavis, Clerk of Court, to The Chief Justice (Mar. 31, 1967); see also\nCrocker, Not To Decide Is To Decide: The U. S. Supreme Court’s Thirty-\nYear Struggle With One Case About Competency To Waive Death\nPenalty Appeals, 49 Wayne L. Rev. 885, 916 (2004). Although Virginia\noriginally opposed the idea of an indefinite stay, see Memorandum for\nRespondent in Rees v. Peyton, O. T. 1966, No. 9, Misc., pp. 2–3 (Mar. 14,\n1967), it eventually accepted the proposal, see Memorandum from John\nF. Davis, supra, at 2 (“In summary, counsel for both parties do not\nreally present any objection to the procedure proposed in the case, but\nneither of them accepts it with enthusiasm”).\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

As\na result, Rees offers no support for federal habeas petition-\ners seeking to stay district court proceedings or for the\nNinth Circuit’s opinions in Rohan, Nash, or this case.8\n   Gonzales barely defends the Ninth Circuit’s interpreta-\ntion of §3599.9 He offers a single, halfhearted argument in\nsupport of the Ninth Circuit’s opinion based on our state-\nment in McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 858 (1994),\nthat “the right to counsel necessarily includes a right for\nthat counsel meaningfully to research and present a de-\nfendant’s habeas claims.” But McFarland was addressing\nwhether a district court could issue a stay of execution\nafter a capital prisoner had filed a request for counsel but\nbefore he had filed his habeas petition. Id., at 854–858.\nWe held that a district court may stay a capital prisoner’s\nexecution once the prisoner has invoked his statutory\nright to counsel. Id., at 859. McFarland has no relevance\n——————\n  8 Moreover, we note that Rees is a pre-AEDPA case. To whatever,\n\nextent Rees can be read to provide guidance in the habeas context, that\nguidance must pass muster under AEDPA.\n  9 See Brief for Respondent in No. 10–930, p. 13 (“The State and the\n\nSolicitor General argue that the federal habeas right-to-counsel provi-\nsion, 18 U. S. C. §3599(a)(2), should not be interpreted to create a ‘right\nto competence’ . . . . However, that is not the question presented in this\ncase. The issue is whether courts have authority to issue a stay, not\nwhether capital habeas petitioners enjoy a freestanding ‘right to com-\npetence,’ or what the contours of such a right may be. The Court need not\nreach that question in order to uphold the discretionary, and tempo-\nrary, stay of proceedings issued in this case”). Notwithstanding Gon-\nzales’ attempt to rewrite the question presented, we granted certiorari \n\non the following question: \n\n“Did the Ninth Circuit err when it held that 18 U. S. C. §3599(a)(2)—\n\nwhich provides that an indigent capital state inmate pursuing federal\nhabeas relief ‘shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more\nattorneys’—impliedly entitles a death row inmate to stay the federal\nhabeas proceedings he initiated if he is not competent to assist counsel?\n12                 RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhere where Gonzales is not seeking a stay of execution,\nbut rather a stay of the District Court’s proceedings.\nMoreover, Gonzales moved for a stay more than six years\nafter initiating his habeas petition. This was certainly\nample time for his attorney to research and present the\nclaims.\n  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that §3599 does not\nprovide federal habeas petitioners with a “statutory right”\nto competence.10\n                             B\n  The Sixth Circuit reached the same conclusion as the\nNinth Circuit but located the statutory right to compe-\ntence during habeas proceedings in 18 U. S. C. §4241.\nRelying largely on Rees I, the Sixth Circuit concluded that\n§4241 provides a statutory right to competence. 644 F. 3d,\nat 333. But as discussed, Part II–A, supra, Rees I did not\nrecognize a statutory right to competence in federal ha-\nbeas proceedings.11 Moreover, §4241 does not even apply to\n\n——————\n   10 Gonzales suggests that 28 U. S. C. §2251 supports the Ninth Cir-\n\ncuit’s decision. But §2251 merely provides district courts with the\nstatutory authority to stay state-court proceedings pending the resolu-\ntion of federal habeas proceedings. Section 2251 says nothing about\nwhether a habeas petitioner is entitled to a stay of the district court’s\nproceedings pending his return to competence.\n   11 The Sixth Circuit made much of the fact that Rees I cited 18\n\nU. S. C. §§4244–4245, the predecessors of §4241. But that citation\nprovides no support for a statutory right to competence. In Rees I,\nas part of our direction to the District Court, we said that it would\n“be appropriate for the District Court to subject Rees to psychiatric and\nother appropriate medical examinations and, so far as necessary, to\ntemporary federal hospitalization for this purpose. Cf. 18 U. S. C.\n§§4244–4245 (1964 ed.).” 384 U. S., at 314. The citation to §§4244–\n4245 did nothing more than point the District Court to those sections of\nthe Criminal Code that set forth the proper procedures for conducting a\ncompetency hearing. There would have been little point in this Court’s\ndirecting the District Court to reinvent the wheel when §4244 already\nprovided a rubric for conducting such a hearing.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch proceedings. Section 4241(a) provides:\n    “At any time after the commencement of a prosecution\n    for an offense and prior to the sentencing of the de-\n    fendant, or at any time after the commencement of\n    probation or supervised release and prior to the com-\n    pletion of the sentence, the defendant or the attorney\n    for the Government may file a motion for a hearing\n    to determine the mental competency of the defendant.\n    The court shall grant the motion, or shall order such a\n    hearing on its own motion, if there is reasonable cause\n    to believe that the defendant may presently be suf-\n    fering from a mental disease or defect rendering him\n    mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable\n    to understand the nature and consequences of the\n    proceedings against him or to assist properly in his\n    defense.”\nBy its own terms, §4241 applies only to trial proceedings\nprior to sentencing and “at any time after the commence-\nment of probation or supervised release.” Federal habeas\nproceedings, however, commence after sentencing, and\nfederal habeas petitioners, by definition, are incarcerated,\nnot on probation.\n   Furthermore, §4241, like the rest of Title 18 generally,\napplies exclusively to federal defendants and probationers\nsubject to prosecution by the United States. Carter is not,\nand does not claim to be, a federal defendant. Rather, he\nis a state prisoner challenging the basis of his conviction in\na federal civil action. See Blair v. Martel, 645 F. 3d 1151,\n1155 (CA9 2011) (“By its own terms, §4241 does not apply\nunless a federal criminal defendant is on trial or is re-\nleased on probation”).\n   Finally, §4241(a) authorizes the district court to grant a\nmotion for a competency determination if there is reason-\nable cause to believe that the defendant’s mental incompe-\ntence renders him “unable to understand the nature and\n14                 RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nconsequences of the proceedings against him or to assist\nproperly in his defense.” (Emphasis added.) See also\n§4241(d).12 A habeas proceeding under §2254, however, is\nnot a “proceedin[g] against” the habeas petitioner; this, on\nthe other hand, is a civil action against the warden of the\nstate prison. And, a federal habeas petitioner does not\nmount a “defense” to the government’s prosecution. Rather,\nthe petitioner collaterally attacks his conviction at an\nearlier state trial. Accordingly, the statutory right to com-\npetence provided in §4241 is simply inapplicable to federal\nhabeas proceedings.\n   We would address Carter’s arguments in defense of the\nSixth Circuit’s decision, but, there are none. Carter’s brief\ninformed us that “[t]his Court need not consider the statu-\ntory argument with which the [petitioner’s] brief begins—\ni.e., that there is no ‘statutory right’ under 18 U. S. C.\n§4241 to be competent in habeas proceedings.” Brief for\nRespondent in No. 11–218, p. 15. Apparently, Carter\nfound the Sixth Circuit’s reasoning indefensible. We\nagree.\n                           III\n  Both Gonzales and Carter argued at length in their\nbriefs and at oral argument that district courts have the\nequitable power to stay proceedings when they determine\nthat habeas petitioners are mentally incompetent.13 Nei-\n——————\n  12 Section 4241(d) provides, in relevant part:\n  “If, after the hearing, the court finds by a preponderance of the\nevidence that the defendant is presently suffering from a mental dis-\nease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that\nhe is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceed-\nings against him or to assist properly in his defense, the court shall\ncommit the defendant to the custody of the Attorney General.” (Empha-\nsis added.)\n  13 This argument is especially curious coming from Gonzales, because\n\nthe District Court denied his request for a stay. For Gonzales to prevail\non his “equitable discretion” theory, Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 10–930,\n                      Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nther petitioner disputes that “[d]istrict courts . . . ordinar-\nily have authority to issue stays, where such a stay would\nbe a proper exercise of discretion.” Rhines v. Weber, 544\nU. S. 269, 276 (2005) (citation omitted); see also Enelow v.\nNew York Life Ins. Co., 293 U. S. 379, 382 (1935) (explain-\ning that a district court may stay a case “pending before it\nby virtue of its inherent power to control the progress of\nthe cause so as to maintain the orderly processes of jus-\ntice”). Similarly, both petitioners agree that “AEDPA does\nnot deprive district courts of [this] authority.” Rhines,\nsupra, at 276. Petitioners and respondents disagree,\nhowever, about the types of situations in which a stay\nwould be appropriate and about the permissible duration\nof a competency-based stay. We do not presume that\ndistrict courts need unsolicited advice from us on how to\nmanage their dockets. Rather, the decision to grant a\nstay, like the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing, is\n“generally left to the sound discretion of district courts.”\nSchriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 473 (2007). For pur-\nposes of resolving these cases, it is unnecessary to deter-\nmine the precise contours of the district court’s discretion\nto issue stays. We address only its outer limits.\n                             A\n  In Gonzales’ case, the District Court correctly found that\nall of Gonzales’ properly exhausted claims were record\nbased or resolvable as a matter of law, irrespective of\nGonzales’ competence.14 617 F. Supp. 2d, at 863; see also\n——————\np. 33, we would have to conclude that the District Court abused its\ndiscretion in denying the stay. But Gonzales has not argued that the\nDistrict Court abused its discretion by denying his stay motion. Gon-\nzales’ arguments, thus, have little to do with the facts of his case.\n   14 Gonzales alleges that the trial judge refused to recuse himself; that\n\nhe was prejudiced by the presence of the victim’s wife in the courtroom\nduring jury selection and following her testimony; that the wife’s in-\ncourt identification was tainted; that there was insufficient evidence to\nsupport two aggravating factors found by the judge; and that Arizona’s\n16                RYAN v.

The court therefore denied Gonzales’ motion for a\nstay. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in so\nholding, because a stay is not generally warranted when\na petitioner raises only record-based claims subject to 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d). As previously noted, review of such\nclaims “is limited to the record that was before the state\ncourt that adjudicated the claim on the merits.” Pin-\nholster, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). Accordingly, any\nevidence that a petitioner might have would be inadmis-\nsible. Ibid. (“[T]he record under review is limited to the\nrecord in existence at that same time—i.e., the record\nbefore the state court”). Because federal habeas is “a\n‘guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal\njustice systems,’ not a substitute for ordinary error correc-\ntion through appeal,” the types of errors redressable under\n§2254(d) should be apparent from the record. Harrington\nv. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13) (quot-\ning Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332, n. 5 (1979)\n(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)). Counsel can read\nthe record.\n                             B\n  In Carter’s case, the District Court concluded that four\nof Carter’s claims could potentially benefit from Carter’s\nassistance.15 However, three of these claims were adju-\ndicated on the merits in state postconviction proceedings\nand, thus, were subject to review under §2254(d). See\nState v. Carter, No. 99–T–0133, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS\n5935, *5–*13 (Dec. 15, 2000). Any extrarecord evidence\n——————\nstatutory death penalty scheme unconstitutionally precludes the sen-\ntencer from considering all mitigating evidence.\n  15 Claim one alleges that Carter was incompetent to stand trial and\n\nwas unlawfully removed from the trial proceedings. Claims two, five,\nand six are ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat Carter might have concerning these claims would\ntherefore be inadmissible. Pinholster, supra, at ___.\nConsequently, these claims do not warrant a stay.\n  It is unclear from the record whether Carter exhausted\nthe fourth claim.16 If that claim was exhausted, it too\nwould be record based. But even if Carter could show that\nthe claim was both unexhausted and not procedurally\ndefaulted,17 an indefinite stay would be inappropriate.\n“AEDPA’s acknowledged purpose” is to “ ‘reduc[e] delays\nin the execution of state and federal criminal sentences.’ ”\nSchriro, supra, at 475 (quoting Woodford, 538 U. S., at\n206).    “Staying a federal habeas petition frustrates\nAEDPA’s objective of encouraging finality by allowing a\npetitioner to delay the resolution of the federal proceed-\nings.” Rhines, 544 U. S., at 277. In the context of discuss-\ning stay and abeyance procedures, we observed:\n     “[N]ot all petitioners have an incentive to obtain fed-\n     eral relief as quickly as possible. In particular, capital\n     petitioners might deliberately engage in dilatory tac-\n     tics to prolong their incarceration and avoid execution\n     of the sentence of death. Without time limits [on\n     stays], petitioners could frustrate AEDPA’s goal of fi-\n     nality by dragging out indefinitely their federal ha-\n     beas review.” Id., at 277–278.\n——————\n  16 The fourth claim alleges ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\n\nfor not raising trial counsel’s failure to pursue the competency-at-trial\nissue. It is unclear from the record whether Carter presented this\nclaim to the Ohio Court of Appeals on state postconviction review, and\nthere is no mention of this claim in that court’s opinion. In the District\nCourt, the State argued that certain claims were procedurally de-\nfaulted, see Carter v.

We, therefore, leave the resolution of this claim\nto the District Court on remand.\n  17 In Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 14,\n\nn. 10), we did “not decide where to draw the line between new claims\nand claims adjudicated on the merits.”\n18                RYAN v.

At some point, the State must be allowed to\ndefend its judgment of conviction.18\n   If a district court concludes that the petitioner’s claim\ncould substantially benefit from the petitioner’s assis-\ntance, the district court should take into account the like-\nlihood that the petitioner will regain competence in the\nforeseeable future.

Argued October 9, 2012—Decided January 8, 2013*\nRespondent Valencia Gonzales, a death row inmate in Arizona, sought\n  federal habeas relief. His counsel moved to stay the proceedings,\n  contending that Gonzales’ mental incompetence prevented him from\n  rationally communicating with or assisting counsel, and that Gonza-\n  les was thus entitled to a stay because, under the Ninth Circuit’s Ro-\n  han decision, what is now 18 U. S. C. §3599(a)(2) requires a stay\n  when a petitioner is adjudged incompetent. The District Court de-\n  nied a stay, finding that the claims before it were record based or re-\n  solvable as a matter of law and thus would not benefit from Gonzales’\n  input. Gonzales thereafter sought a writ of mandamus in the Ninth\n  Circuit. Applying Rohan and its recent decision in Nash—which\n  gave habeas petitioners a right to competence even on record-based\n  appeals—the court granted the writ, concluding that §3599 gave\n  Gonzales the right to a stay pending a competency determination.\n     Respondent Sean Carter, a death row inmate in Ohio, initiated\n  federal habeas proceedings but eventually moved for a competency\n  determination and stay of the proceedings. The District Court grant-\n  ed the motion and found Carter incompetent to assist counsel. Ap-\n  plying the Ninth Circuit’s Rohan test, it determined that Carter’s as-\n  sistance was required to develop four of his exhausted claims. It thus\n  dismissed his habeas petition without prejudice and prospectively\n  tolled the statute of limitations. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit, relying\n  in part on Rees v. Peyton, 384 U. S. 312 (Rees I), located a statutory\n  right to competence in 18 U. S. C. §4241, and found that a court could\n——————\n  * Together with No. 11–218, Tibbals, Warden v.

VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    employ that provision whenever a capital habeas petitioner seeks to\n    forgo his petition. It thus ordered that Carter’s petition be stayed in-\n    definitely with respect to any claims requiring his assistance.\nHeld:\n    1. Section 3599 does not provide a state prisoner a right to suspen-\n sion of his federal habeas proceedings when he is adjudged incompe-\n tent. Pp. 5–12.\n       (a) The assertion of such a right lacks any basis in the provision’s\n text. Section 3599 guarantees federal habeas petitioners on death\n row the right to federally funded counsel, §3599(a)(2), and sets out\n various requirements that appointed counsel must meet, §§3599(b)–\n (e), but it does not direct district courts to stay proceedings when pe-\n titioners are found incompetent. The assertion is also difficult to\n square with the Court’s constitutional precedents. If the Sixth\n Amendment right carried with it an implied right to competence, the\n right to competence at trial would flow from that Amendment, not\n from the right to due process, see Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U. S. 348,\n 354. But while the benefits flowing from the right to counsel at trial\n could be affected if an incompetent defendant is unable to communi-\n cate with his attorney, this Court has never said that the right to\n competence derives from the right to counsel. And the Court will not\n assume or infer that Congress intended to depart from such prece-\n dent and locate a right to competence in federal habeas proceedings\n within the right to counsel. See Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S.\n ___, ___. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) The Ninth Circuit identified its rule in Rohan, concluding\n there that a petitioner’s mental incompetency could “eviscerate the\n statutory right to counsel” in federal habeas proceedings. But given\n the backward-looking, record-based nature of §2254 proceedings,\n counsel can generally provide effective representation to a habeas pe-\n titioner regardless of the petitioner’s competence. Rees I, supra, Rees\n v. Peyton, 386 U. S. 989, and Rees v. Superintendent of the Va. State\n Penitentiary, 516 U. S 802, which involved an incompetent death row\n inmate’s attempt to withdraw his certiorari petition, offer no support\n for federal habeas petitioners seeking to stay district court proceed-\n ings or for the Ninth Circuit’s opinions in Rohan, Nash, or this case.\n The Ninth Circuit’s interpretation is also not supported by McFar-\n land v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 858, in which this Court held that a dis-\n trict court could stay an execution after a capital prisoner had in-\n voked his right to counsel but before he had filed his habeas petition.\n In contrast, Gonzales is seeking to stay the District Court’s proceed-\n ings, and he sought a stay more than six years after initiating his\n habeas petition, certainly ample time for his attorney to research and\n present the claims.

Section 4241 also does not provide a statutory right to compe-\n  tence during federal habeas proceedings. The Sixth Circuit based its\n  conclusion largely on a misreading of Rees I, which did not recognize\n  such a right. Moreover, §4241 does not even apply to habeas proceed-\n  ings. By its terms, it applies only to trial proceedings prior to sen-\n  tencing and “at any time after the commencement of probation or su-\n  pervised release.” Federal habeas proceedings, however, commence\n  after sentencing, and federal habeas petitioners are incarcerated, not\n  on probation. Furthermore, §4241, like the rest of Title 18 generally,\n  applies exclusively to federal defendants, not to state prisoners like\n  Carter. Finally, §4241(a) authorizes a district court to grant a motion\n  for a competency determination if there is reasonable cause to believe\n  that the defendant’s mental incompetence renders him “unable to\n  understand . . . the proceedings against him or to assist properly in\n  his defense,” while a §2254 habeas proceeding is a civil action against\n  a state-prison warden, in which the petitioner collaterally attacks his\n  conviction in an earlier state trial. Pp. 12–14.\n     3. For purposes of resolving these cases, it is sufficient to address\n  the outer limits of the district court’s discretion to issue stays; it is\n  unnecessary to determine the precise contours of that discretion. In\n  Gonzales’ case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in deny-\n  ing a stay after finding that Gonzales’ claims were all record based or\n  resolvable as a matter of law, regardless of his competence. Review\n  of a petitioner’s record-based claims subject to §2254(d) is limited to\n  the record before the state court that heard the case on the merits.\n  Any evidence that Gonzales might have would be inadmissible. In\n  Carter’s case, three of his claims do not warrant a stay because they\n  were adjudicated on the merits in state postconviction proceedings\n  and thus subject to review under §2254(d). Thus, extrarecord evi-\n  dence that he might have concerning these claims would be inadmis-\n  sible. It is unclear from the record whether he exhausted his fourth\n  claim. If it was exhausted, it too would be record based. But even if\n  it was both unexhausted and not procedurally defaulted, an indefi-\n  nite stay would be inappropriate, since such a stay would permit pe-\n  titioners to “frustrate [the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\n  Act of 1996’s] goal of finality by dragging out indefinitely their feder-\n  al habeas review.” Rhines v.

We hold\nthat neither 18 U. S. C. §3599 nor 18 U. S. C. §4241 pro-\nvides such a right and that the Courts of Appeals for the\nNinth and Sixth Circuits both erred in holding that dis-\ntrict courts must stay federal habeas proceedings when\npetitioners are adjudged incompetent.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n   Ernest Valencia Gonzales was convicted by an Arizona\njury of felony murder, armed robbery, aggravated assault,\nfirst-degree burglary, and theft. The convictions arose\n2              RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom Gonzales’ repeated stabbing of Darrel and Deborah\nWagner in front of their 7-year-old son during a burglary\nof the Wagners’ home. Darrel Wagner died from the stab-\nbing, while Deborah Wagner survived but spent five days\nin intensive care. The trial court sentenced Gonzales to\ndeath on the murder charge and to various prison terms\nfor the other crimes.\n   After exhausting state remedies, Gonzales filed a peti-\ntion for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court\non November 15, 1999. While the petition was pending,\nGonzales’ appointed counsel moved to stay the proceed-\nings, contending that Gonzales was no longer capable of\nrationally communicating with or assisting counsel. He\nargued that mental incompetence entitled Gonzales to a\nstay under Ninth Circuit precedent. See Rohan v. Wood-\nford, 334 F. 3d 803 (2003). In Rohan, the Ninth Circuit\nheld that the federal statute guaranteeing state capital\nprisoners a right to counsel in federal habeas proceedings,\n21 U. S. C. §848(q)(4)(B) (2000 ed.) (now codified as 18\nU. S. C. §3599(a)(2)), could not “be faithfully enforced\nunless courts ensure that a petitioner is competent,” 334\nF. 3d, at 813. Rohan thus concluded that “where an\nincompetent capital habeas petitioner raises claims that\ncould potentially benefit from his ability to communicate\nrationally, refusing to stay proceedings pending restora-\ntion of competence denies him his statutory right to assis-\ntance of counsel, whether or not counsel can identify with\nprecision the information sought.” Id., at 819.\n   Applying Rohan, the District Court denied a stay after\nconcluding that the claims properly before it were record\nbased or resolvable as a matter of law and thus would not\nbenefit from Gonzales’ input. The court found it unnec-\nessary to determine whether Gonzales was incompetent,\nthough it did find that he possessed “at least a limited\ncapacity for rational communication.” Gonzales v. Schriro,\n617 F. Supp. 2d 849, 863 (Ariz. 2008).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Gonzales thereafter filed an emergency petition for a\nwrit of mandamus in the Ninth Circuit. While Gonzales’\npetition was pending, the Ninth Circuit decided Nash v.\nRyan, 581 F. 3d 1048 (2009), which held that habeas\npetitioners have a right to competence on appeal, even\nthough appeals are entirely record based. Id., at 1050\n(“While an appeal is record-based, that does not mean\nthat a habeas petitioner in a capital case is relegated to\na nonexistent role. Meaningful assistance of appellate\ncounsel may require rational communication between\ncounsel and a habeas petitioner”). Applying Nash and\nRohan, the court granted the writ of mandamus, conclud-\ning that even though Gonzales’ “exhausted claims are\nrecord-based or legal in nature, he is entitled to a stay\npending a competency determination” under 18 U. S. C.\n§3599. In re Gonzales, 623 F. 3d 1242, 1244 (2010).\n  We granted certiorari to determine whether §3599\nprovides a statutory right to competence in federal habeas\nproceedings. 565 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                              B\n  Sean Carter was convicted by an Ohio jury of aggra-\nvated murder, aggravated robbery, and rape, and sen-\ntenced to death for anally raping his adoptive grandmother,\nVeader Prince, and stabbing her to death. After exhaust-\ning his state-court appeals, Carter initiated federal habeas\nproceedings on March 19, 2002, in the Northern District of\nOhio. Carter eventually filed a third amended petition,\nalong with a motion requesting a competency determi-\nnation and a stay of the proceedings. The District Court\ngranted the motion.\n  Following several psychiatric evaluations and a com-\npetency determination, the District Court found Carter\nincompetent to assist counsel. Applying the Ninth Cir-\ncuit’s test in Rohan, it determined that Carter’s assistance\nwas required to develop four of his exhausted claims. As a\n4                 RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nresult, the court dismissed his habeas petition without\nprejudice and prospectively tolled the statute of limita-\ntions. Carter v. Bradshaw, 583 F. Supp. 2d 872, 884\n(2008). The State appealed.\n   The Sixth Circuit acknowledged that “[f]ederal habeas\npetitioners facing the death penalty for state criminal\nconvictions do not enjoy a constitutional right to compe-\ntence.” Carter v. Bradshaw, 644 F. 3d 329, 332 (2011). It\nnevertheless located a statutory right to competence in\n§4241, relying, in part, on this Court’s decision in Rees v.\nPeyton, 384 U. S. 312 (1966) (per curiam) (Rees I ).1 644\nF. 3d, at 332. The Sixth Circuit explained:\n       “By applying section 4241 to habeas actions, Rees\n     addresses the situation where a habeas petitioner\n     awaiting the death penalty may seek to forego any\n     collateral attacks on his conviction or sentence, and\n     defines a statutory right for the petitioner to be com-\n     petent enough to (1) understand the nature and\n     consequences of the proceedings against him, and (2)\n     assist properly in his defense.” Id., at 333.\nThe court concluded that “[a]nytime a capital habeas\npetitioner affirmatively seeks to forego his habeas petition,\nwhether by action or inaction, . . . a district court may\nemploy section 4241.” Id., at 334.\n  The court therefore amended the District Court’s judg-\nment and ordered that Carter’s petition be stayed in-\ndefinitely with respect to any claims that required his\nassistance. Id., at 336–337. Judge Rogers dissented, arguing\nthat there was no constitutional or statutory basis for the\ncourt’s decision. Id., at 337–342.\n  We granted certiorari to determine whether §4241\nprovides a statutory right to competence in federal habeas\n——————\n  1 In Rees, we held indefinitely a petition for certiorari after an in-\n\ncompetent capital inmate sought to withdraw his petition prior to our\nreview. 384 U.

S. ___ (2012).\n                             II\n  Both the Ninth and Sixth Circuits have concluded that\ndeath row inmates pursuing federal habeas are entitled to\na suspension of proceedings when found incompetent. The\nNinth Circuit located this right in §3599, while the Sixth\nCircuit located it in §4241. Neither section provides such\na right.\n                              A\n   Section 3599(a)(2) guarantees federal habeas petitioners\non death row the right to federally funded counsel.2 The\nstatute provides that petitioners who are “financially\nunable to obtain adequate representation . . . shall be\nentitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys.”\nAppointed attorneys are required to have experience in\ndeath penalty litigation, §§3599(b)–(d), and, once appointed,\nare directed to “represent the defendant throughout\nevery subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings,”\n§3599(e). The statute also gives district courts the power\nto authorize funding for “investigative, expert, or other\nservices” as are “reasonably necessary for the representa-\ntion of the defendant.” §3599(f). But §3599 does not direct\ndistrict courts to stay proceedings when habeas petitioners\nare found incompetent.3\n——————\n  2 “In any postconviction proceeding under [28 U. S. C. §2254 or\n\n§2255], seeking to vacate or set aside a death sentence, any defendant\nwho is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation\nor investigative, expert, or other reasonably necessary services shall be\nentitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys and the furnishing\nof such other services in accordance with subsections (b) through (f ).”\n18 U. S. C. §3599(a)(2).\n  3 In fact, §3599(e), which contains the section’s sole reference to “com-\n\npetency,” cuts against the Ninth Circuit’s conclusion. That section\nprovides that appointed attorneys “shall also represent the defendant\nin such competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or other\nclemency as may be available to the defendant.” We doubt that Con-\n6                RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   In addition to lacking any basis in the statutory text,\nthe assertion that the right to counsel implies a right to\ncompetence is difficult to square with our constitutional\nprecedents. The right to counsel is located in the Sixth\nAmendment. (“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused\nshall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel\nfor his defence.”) If the right to counsel carried with it\nan implied right to competence, the right to competence\nat trial would flow from the Sixth Amendment. But “[w]e\nhave repeatedly and consistently recognized that ‘the\ncriminal trial of an incompetent defendant violates due\nprocess,’ ” not the Sixth Amendment. Cooper v. Oklahoma,\n517 U. S. 348, 354 (1996) (quoting Medina v. California,\n505 U. S. 437, 453 (1992); emphasis added); see also Drope\nv. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 172 (1975) (“[T]he failure to\nobserve procedures adequate to protect a defendant’s right\nnot to be tried or convicted while incompetent to stand\ntrial deprives him of his due process right to a fair trial”\n(citing Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 385 (1966))).\n   It stands to reason that the benefits flowing from the\nright to counsel at trial could be affected if an incompe-\ntent defendant is unable to communicate with his attorney.\nFor example, an incompetent defendant would be unable\nto assist counsel in identifying witnesses and deciding on\na trial strategy. For this reason, “[a] defendant may not\nbe put to trial unless he ‘ “has sufficient present ability to\nconsult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of ra-\ntional understanding . . . [and] a rational as well as factual\nunderstanding of the proceedings against him.” ’ ” Cooper,\nsupra, at 354 (quoting Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S.\n402 (1960) (per curiam)). Notwithstanding the connection\nbetween the right to competence at trial and the right to\ncounsel at trial, we have never said that the right to com-\n—————— \n\ngress would have authorized counsel to represent inmates in postcon-\nviction competency proceedings only if the inmates were competent. \n\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

We will not\nassume or infer that Congress intended to depart from our\nprecedents and locate a right to competence in federal\nhabeas proceedings within the right to counsel. “We nor-\nmally assume that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is\naware of relevant judicial precedent.” Merck & Co. v.\nReynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 12).\n   The Ninth Circuit located a statutory right to compe-\ntence in §3599. 623 F. 3d, at 1245 (citing Rohan, 334 F. 3d\n803, and Nash, 581 F. 3d 1048). Because Rohan is the\nNinth Circuit’s controlling precedent, we briefly address\nthat decision.\n   In Rohan, a habeas petitioner asserted a right to com-\npetency based both on the Due Process Clause and on 21\nU. S. C. §848(q)(4)(B) (2000 ed.). After discussing the\nhistory of the common law, which prohibited the indict-\nment, trial and execution of mentally incompetent defend-\nants,4 the Court of Appeals stated that the petitioner’s\ndue process claim raised “substantial” “constitutional ques-\ntions.” Rohan, 334 F. 3d, at 814. This conclusion is puz-\nzling in light of the Ninth Circuit’s acknowledgment that\nthere is “no constitutional right to counsel on habeas,” id.,\nat 810 (citing Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 10 (1989)\n(plurality opinion)), and that “there is no due process right\nto collateral review at all,” 334 F. 3d, at 810 (citing United\n——————\n  4 Blackstone   explained the common-law rule as follows:\n   “[I]f a man in his sound memory commits a capital offence, and before\narraignment for it, he becomes mad, he ought not to be arraigned for it;\nbecause he is not able to plead to it with that advice and caution that\nhe ought. And if, after he has pleaded, the prisoner becomes mad, he\nshall not be tried; for how can he make his defence? If, after he be tried\nand found guilty, he loses his senses before judgment, judgment shall\nnot be pronounced; and if, after judgment, he becomes of nonsane\nmemory, execution shall be stayed: for peradventure, says the human-\nity of the English law, had the prisoner been of sound memory, he might\nhave alleged something in stay of judgment or execution.” 4 W. Black-\nstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 24–25 (1769).\n8                  RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nStates v. MacCollom, 426 U. S. 317, 323 (1976) (plurality\nopinion)). The Ninth Circuit was simply incorrect in\nsuggesting that, in this case, there might be a constitu-\ntional concern—much less a “substantial” one—raised by\nthe petitioner’s due process claim.\n   Invoking the canon of constitutional avoidance, the\nNinth Circuit gave the petitioner the practical benefit of\na due process right to competence in federal habeas pro-\nceedings through its interpretation of §848(q)(4)(B).5 334\nF. 3d, at 814. In analyzing that statute, the Rohan court\nrelied on a Ninth Circuit en banc opinion in Calderon v.\nUnited States Dist. Court for Central Dist. of Cal., 163\nF. 3d 530 (1998) (Kelly V), overruled in unrelated part,\nWoodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202 (2003), which held\nthat a prisoner’s incompetence is grounds for equitably\ntolling the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nof 1996’s (AEDPA) 1-year statute of limitations for filing\nhabeas petitions. The Rohan court purported to be bound\nby the “rationale” of Kelly V—that a prisoner’s incompe-\ntence could “eviscerate the statutory right to counsel,”6\n——————\n    5 As noted supra, at 2, §848(q)(4)(B) has been superseded by 18\nU. S. C. §3599(a)(2).\n  6 It is unclear how Kelly V’s determination that mental incompetence\n\nis grounds for AEDPA equitable tolling could possibly control the\noutcome in Rohan, which had nothing to do with AEDPA’s statute of\nlimitations. The relevant questions for equitable tolling purposes are\nwhether the petitioner has “ ‘been pursuing his rights diligently’ ” and\nwhether “ ‘some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.’ ” Hol-\nland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 16–17) (quoting\nPace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005)). But the propriety of\nequitably tolling AEDPA’s statute of limitations in the case of a men-\ntally incompetent petitioner has nothing to do with the statutory right to\ncounsel. The Ninth Circuit has held that habeas petitioners who do not\nhave a statutory right to counsel (i.e., all habeas petitioners other than\nthose on death row) may still avail themselves of equitable tolling if\nthey are mentally incompetent. See, e.g., Bills v. Clark, 628 F. 3d 1092,\n1097 (2010) (establishing standard for deciding equitable tolling claims\npredicated on mental incompetence); Laws v. Lamarque, 351 F. 3d 919,\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

Given the backward-looking, record-based\nnature of most federal habeas proceedings, counsel can\ngenerally provide effective representation to a habeas\npetitioner regardless of the petitioner’s competence. In-\ndeed, where a claim is “adjudicated on the merits in State\ncourt proceedings,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) (2006 ed.), counsel\nshould, in most circumstances, be able to identify whether\nthe “adjudication . . . resulted in a decision that was con-\ntrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States,” §2254(d)(1), without any evi-\ndence outside the record. See Cullen v. Pinholster, 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (“[R]eview under [28\nU. S. C.] §2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was\nbefore the state court that adjudicated the claim on the\nmerits. . . . This backward-looking language requires an\nexamination of the state-court decision at the time it was\nmade. It follows that the record under review is limited to\nthe record in existence at that same time—i.e., the record\nbefore the state court”). Attorneys are quite capable of\nreviewing the state-court record, identifying legal errors,\nand marshaling relevant arguments, even without their\nclients’ assistance.\n   Rohan also cited Rees I, 384 U. S. 312, in support of its\nconclusion. 334 F. 3d, at 815.

VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndeath row filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nDistrict Court, alleging that the state-court conviction\nviolated his constitutional rights. 384 U. S., at 313. The\nDistrict Court denied his petition, and the Court of Ap-\npeals affirmed. Ibid. Shortly after Rees’ counsel filed a\npetition for certiorari with this Court, Rees directed his\ncounsel to withdraw the petition and to forgo any further\nproceedings. Counsel advised the Court that he could not\naccede to these instructions without a psychiatric evalua-\ntion of Rees, because there was some doubt as to Rees’\nmental competency. Ibid. In response, the Court directed\nthe District Court to determine Rees’ mental competence.\nId., at 313–314. After the District Court conducted a\nhearing and found Rees incompetent, the Court issued a\none-sentence order directing that the petition for certiorari\nbe “held without action.” Rees v. Peyton, 386 U. S. 989\n(1967) (Rees II ).7 When Rees died several decades later,\nthe Court dismissed the petition. Rees v. Superintendent\nof Va. State Penitentiary, 516 U. S. 802 (1995) (Rees III ).\n   The Ninth Circuit concluded that “[t]he record in Rees II\nshows that incompetence is grounds for staying habeas\nproceedings.” Rohan, supra, at 815. This conclusion is\nunwarranted. Rees I concerned whether an incompetent\nhabeas petitioner may withdraw his certiorari petition,\n——————\n  7 This order was issued after the Clerk of the Court spoke with the\n\nattorneys for Virginia and for the petitioner and proposed that the\nCourt hold the petition indefinitely. See Memorandum from John F.\nDavis, Clerk of Court, to The Chief Justice (Mar. 31, 1967); see also\nCrocker, Not To Decide Is To Decide: The U. S. Supreme Court’s Thirty-\nYear Struggle With One Case About Competency To Waive Death\nPenalty Appeals, 49 Wayne L. Rev. 885, 916 (2004). Although Virginia\noriginally opposed the idea of an indefinite stay, see Memorandum for\nRespondent in Rees v. Peyton, O. T. 1966, No. 9, Misc., pp. 2–3 (Mar. 14,\n1967), it eventually accepted the proposal, see Memorandum from John\nF. Davis, supra, at 2 (“In summary, counsel for both parties do not\nreally present any objection to the procedure proposed in the case, but\nneither of them accepts it with enthusiasm”).\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

As\na result, Rees offers no support for federal habeas petition-\ners seeking to stay district court proceedings or for the\nNinth Circuit’s opinions in Rohan, Nash, or this case.8\n   Gonzales barely defends the Ninth Circuit’s interpreta-\ntion of §3599.9 He offers a single, halfhearted argument in\nsupport of the Ninth Circuit’s opinion based on our state-\nment in McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 858 (1994),\nthat “the right to counsel necessarily includes a right for\nthat counsel meaningfully to research and present a de-\nfendant’s habeas claims.” But McFarland was addressing\nwhether a district court could issue a stay of execution\nafter a capital prisoner had filed a request for counsel but\nbefore he had filed his habeas petition. Id., at 854–858.\nWe held that a district court may stay a capital prisoner’s\nexecution once the prisoner has invoked his statutory\nright to counsel. Id., at 859. McFarland has no relevance\n——————\n  8 Moreover, we note that Rees is a pre-AEDPA case. To whatever,\n\nextent Rees can be read to provide guidance in the habeas context, that\nguidance must pass muster under AEDPA.\n  9 See Brief for Respondent in No. 10–930, p. 13 (“The State and the\n\nSolicitor General argue that the federal habeas right-to-counsel provi-\nsion, 18 U. S. C. §3599(a)(2), should not be interpreted to create a ‘right\nto competence’ . . . . However, that is not the question presented in this\ncase. The issue is whether courts have authority to issue a stay, not\nwhether capital habeas petitioners enjoy a freestanding ‘right to com-\npetence,’ or what the contours of such a right may be. The Court need not\nreach that question in order to uphold the discretionary, and tempo-\nrary, stay of proceedings issued in this case”). Notwithstanding Gon-\nzales’ attempt to rewrite the question presented, we granted certiorari \n\non the following question: \n\n“Did the Ninth Circuit err when it held that 18 U. S. C. §3599(a)(2)—\n\nwhich provides that an indigent capital state inmate pursuing federal\nhabeas relief ‘shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more\nattorneys’—impliedly entitles a death row inmate to stay the federal\nhabeas proceedings he initiated if he is not competent to assist counsel?\n12                 RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhere where Gonzales is not seeking a stay of execution,\nbut rather a stay of the District Court’s proceedings.\nMoreover, Gonzales moved for a stay more than six years\nafter initiating his habeas petition. This was certainly\nample time for his attorney to research and present the\nclaims.\n  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that §3599 does not\nprovide federal habeas petitioners with a “statutory right”\nto competence.10\n                             B\n  The Sixth Circuit reached the same conclusion as the\nNinth Circuit but located the statutory right to compe-\ntence during habeas proceedings in 18 U. S. C. §4241.\nRelying largely on Rees I, the Sixth Circuit concluded that\n§4241 provides a statutory right to competence. 644 F. 3d,\nat 333. But as discussed, Part II–A, supra, Rees I did not\nrecognize a statutory right to competence in federal ha-\nbeas proceedings.11 Moreover, §4241 does not even apply to\n\n——————\n   10 Gonzales suggests that 28 U. S. C. §2251 supports the Ninth Cir-\n\ncuit’s decision. But §2251 merely provides district courts with the\nstatutory authority to stay state-court proceedings pending the resolu-\ntion of federal habeas proceedings. Section 2251 says nothing about\nwhether a habeas petitioner is entitled to a stay of the district court’s\nproceedings pending his return to competence.\n   11 The Sixth Circuit made much of the fact that Rees I cited 18\n\nU. S. C. §§4244–4245, the predecessors of §4241. But that citation\nprovides no support for a statutory right to competence. In Rees I,\nas part of our direction to the District Court, we said that it would\n“be appropriate for the District Court to subject Rees to psychiatric and\nother appropriate medical examinations and, so far as necessary, to\ntemporary federal hospitalization for this purpose. Cf. 18 U. S. C.\n§§4244–4245 (1964 ed.).” 384 U. S., at 314. The citation to §§4244–\n4245 did nothing more than point the District Court to those sections of\nthe Criminal Code that set forth the proper procedures for conducting a\ncompetency hearing. There would have been little point in this Court’s\ndirecting the District Court to reinvent the wheel when §4244 already\nprovided a rubric for conducting such a hearing.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch proceedings. Section 4241(a) provides:\n    “At any time after the commencement of a prosecution\n    for an offense and prior to the sentencing of the de-\n    fendant, or at any time after the commencement of\n    probation or supervised release and prior to the com-\n    pletion of the sentence, the defendant or the attorney\n    for the Government may file a motion for a hearing\n    to determine the mental competency of the defendant.\n    The court shall grant the motion, or shall order such a\n    hearing on its own motion, if there is reasonable cause\n    to believe that the defendant may presently be suf-\n    fering from a mental disease or defect rendering him\n    mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable\n    to understand the nature and consequences of the\n    proceedings against him or to assist properly in his\n    defense.”\nBy its own terms, §4241 applies only to trial proceedings\nprior to sentencing and “at any time after the commence-\nment of probation or supervised release.” Federal habeas\nproceedings, however, commence after sentencing, and\nfederal habeas petitioners, by definition, are incarcerated,\nnot on probation.\n   Furthermore, §4241, like the rest of Title 18 generally,\napplies exclusively to federal defendants and probationers\nsubject to prosecution by the United States. Carter is not,\nand does not claim to be, a federal defendant. Rather, he\nis a state prisoner challenging the basis of his conviction in\na federal civil action. See Blair v. Martel, 645 F. 3d 1151,\n1155 (CA9 2011) (“By its own terms, §4241 does not apply\nunless a federal criminal defendant is on trial or is re-\nleased on probation”).\n   Finally, §4241(a) authorizes the district court to grant a\nmotion for a competency determination if there is reason-\nable cause to believe that the defendant’s mental incompe-\ntence renders him “unable to understand the nature and\n14                 RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nconsequences of the proceedings against him or to assist\nproperly in his defense.” (Emphasis added.) See also\n§4241(d).12 A habeas proceeding under §2254, however, is\nnot a “proceedin[g] against” the habeas petitioner; this, on\nthe other hand, is a civil action against the warden of the\nstate prison. And, a federal habeas petitioner does not\nmount a “defense” to the government’s prosecution. Rather,\nthe petitioner collaterally attacks his conviction at an\nearlier state trial. Accordingly, the statutory right to com-\npetence provided in §4241 is simply inapplicable to federal\nhabeas proceedings.\n   We would address Carter’s arguments in defense of the\nSixth Circuit’s decision, but, there are none. Carter’s brief\ninformed us that “[t]his Court need not consider the statu-\ntory argument with which the [petitioner’s] brief begins—\ni.e., that there is no ‘statutory right’ under 18 U. S. C.\n§4241 to be competent in habeas proceedings.” Brief for\nRespondent in No. 11–218, p. 15. Apparently, Carter\nfound the Sixth Circuit’s reasoning indefensible. We\nagree.\n                           III\n  Both Gonzales and Carter argued at length in their\nbriefs and at oral argument that district courts have the\nequitable power to stay proceedings when they determine\nthat habeas petitioners are mentally incompetent.13 Nei-\n——————\n  12 Section 4241(d) provides, in relevant part:\n  “If, after the hearing, the court finds by a preponderance of the\nevidence that the defendant is presently suffering from a mental dis-\nease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that\nhe is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceed-\nings against him or to assist properly in his defense, the court shall\ncommit the defendant to the custody of the Attorney General.” (Empha-\nsis added.)\n  13 This argument is especially curious coming from Gonzales, because\n\nthe District Court denied his request for a stay. For Gonzales to prevail\non his “equitable discretion” theory, Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 10–930,\n                      Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nther petitioner disputes that “[d]istrict courts . . . ordinar-\nily have authority to issue stays, where such a stay would\nbe a proper exercise of discretion.” Rhines v. Weber, 544\nU. S. 269, 276 (2005) (citation omitted); see also Enelow v.\nNew York Life Ins. Co., 293 U. S. 379, 382 (1935) (explain-\ning that a district court may stay a case “pending before it\nby virtue of its inherent power to control the progress of\nthe cause so as to maintain the orderly processes of jus-\ntice”). Similarly, both petitioners agree that “AEDPA does\nnot deprive district courts of [this] authority.” Rhines,\nsupra, at 276. Petitioners and respondents disagree,\nhowever, about the types of situations in which a stay\nwould be appropriate and about the permissible duration\nof a competency-based stay. We do not presume that\ndistrict courts need unsolicited advice from us on how to\nmanage their dockets. Rather, the decision to grant a\nstay, like the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing, is\n“generally left to the sound discretion of district courts.”\nSchriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 473 (2007). For pur-\nposes of resolving these cases, it is unnecessary to deter-\nmine the precise contours of the district court’s discretion\nto issue stays. We address only its outer limits.\n                             A\n  In Gonzales’ case, the District Court correctly found that\nall of Gonzales’ properly exhausted claims were record\nbased or resolvable as a matter of law, irrespective of\nGonzales’ competence.14 617 F. Supp. 2d, at 863; see also\n——————\np. 33, we would have to conclude that the District Court abused its\ndiscretion in denying the stay. But Gonzales has not argued that the\nDistrict Court abused its discretion by denying his stay motion. Gon-\nzales’ arguments, thus, have little to do with the facts of his case.\n   14 Gonzales alleges that the trial judge refused to recuse himself; that\n\nhe was prejudiced by the presence of the victim’s wife in the courtroom\nduring jury selection and following her testimony; that the wife’s in-\ncourt identification was tainted; that there was insufficient evidence to\nsupport two aggravating factors found by the judge; and that Arizona’s\n16                RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nState v. Gonzales, 181 Ariz. 502, 509–515, 892 P. 2d 838,\n845–851 (1995) (adjudicating Gonzales’ claims on the\nmerits). The court therefore denied Gonzales’ motion for a\nstay. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in so\nholding, because a stay is not generally warranted when\na petitioner raises only record-based claims subject to 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d). As previously noted, review of such\nclaims “is limited to the record that was before the state\ncourt that adjudicated the claim on the merits.” Pin-\nholster, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). Accordingly, any\nevidence that a petitioner might have would be inadmis-\nsible. Ibid. (“[T]he record under review is limited to the\nrecord in existence at that same time—i.e., the record\nbefore the state court”). Because federal habeas is “a\n‘guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal\njustice systems,’ not a substitute for ordinary error correc-\ntion through appeal,” the types of errors redressable under\n§2254(d) should be apparent from the record. Harrington\nv. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13) (quot-\ning Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332, n. 5 (1979)\n(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)). Counsel can read\nthe record.\n                             B\n  In Carter’s case, the District Court concluded that four\nof Carter’s claims could potentially benefit from Carter’s\nassistance.15 However, three of these claims were adju-\ndicated on the merits in state postconviction proceedings\nand, thus, were subject to review under §2254(d). See\nState v. Carter, No. 99–T–0133, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS\n5935, *5–*13 (Dec. 15, 2000). Any extrarecord evidence\n——————\nstatutory death penalty scheme unconstitutionally precludes the sen-\ntencer from considering all mitigating evidence.\n  15 Claim one alleges that Carter was incompetent to stand trial and\n\nwas unlawfully removed from the trial proceedings. Claims two, five,\nand six are ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat Carter might have concerning these claims would\ntherefore be inadmissible. Pinholster, supra, at ___.\nConsequently, these claims do not warrant a stay.\n  It is unclear from the record whether Carter exhausted\nthe fourth claim.16 If that claim was exhausted, it too\nwould be record based. But even if Carter could show that\nthe claim was both unexhausted and not procedurally\ndefaulted,17 an indefinite stay would be inappropriate.\n“AEDPA’s acknowledged purpose” is to “ ‘reduc[e] delays\nin the execution of state and federal criminal sentences.’ ”\nSchriro, supra, at 475 (quoting Woodford, 538 U. S., at\n206).    “Staying a federal habeas petition frustrates\nAEDPA’s objective of encouraging finality by allowing a\npetitioner to delay the resolution of the federal proceed-\nings.” Rhines, 544 U. S., at 277. In the context of discuss-\ning stay and abeyance procedures, we observed:\n     “[N]ot all petitioners have an incentive to obtain fed-\n     eral relief as quickly as possible. In particular, capital\n     petitioners might deliberately engage in dilatory tac-\n     tics to prolong their incarceration and avoid execution\n     of the sentence of death. Without time limits [on\n     stays], petitioners could frustrate AEDPA’s goal of fi-\n     nality by dragging out indefinitely their federal ha-\n     beas review.” Id., at 277–278.\n——————\n  16 The fourth claim alleges ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\n\nfor not raising trial counsel’s failure to pursue the competency-at-trial\nissue. It is unclear from the record whether Carter presented this\nclaim to the Ohio Court of Appeals on state postconviction review, and\nthere is no mention of this claim in that court’s opinion. In the District\nCourt, the State argued that certain claims were procedurally de-\nfaulted, see Carter v. Bradshaw, 583 F. Supp. 2d 872, 880 (ND Ohio 2008),\nbut the court deferred ruling on this argument. The State was likely\nreferring to claim four. We, therefore, leave the resolution of this claim\nto the District Court on remand.\n  17 In Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 14,\n\nn. 10), we did “not decide where to draw the line between new claims\nand claims adjudicated on the merits.”\n18                RYAN v. VALENCIA GONZALES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nThe same principle obtains in the context of competency-\nbased stays. At some point, the State must be allowed to\ndefend its judgment of conviction.18\n   If a district court concludes that the petitioner’s claim\ncould substantially benefit from the petitioner’s assis-\ntance, the district court should take into account the like-\nlihood that the petitioner will regain competence in the\nforeseeable future. Where there is no reasonable hope of\ncompetence, a stay is inappropriate and merely frustrates\nthe State’s attempts to defend its presumptively valid\njudgment.\n                             IV\n  The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed. We\nvacate the judgment of the Sixth Circuit and remand the\ncase for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  18 Ouropinion today does not implicate the prohibition against “ ‘car-\nrying out a sentence of death upon a prisoner who is insane.’ ” Panetti\nv.
