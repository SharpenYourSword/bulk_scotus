AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL\n\n                 CENTER ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n No. 11–1231. Argued December 4, 2012—Decided January 22, 2013\nThe reimbursement amount health care providers receive for inpatient\n  services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries is adjusted upward for\n  hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.\n  The adjustment amount is determined in part by the percentage of a\n  hospital’s patients who are eligible for Supplemental Security Income\n  (SSI), called the SSI fraction. Each year, the Centers for Medicare &\n  Medicaid Services (CMS) calculates the SSI fraction for an eligible\n  hospital and submits that number to the hospital’s “fiscal intermedi-\n  ary,” a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) contractor.\n  The intermediary computes the reimbursement amount due and then\n  sends the hospital a Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR). A\n  provider dissatisfied with the determination has a right to appeal to\n  the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB or Board) within\n  180 days of receiving the NPR. 42 U. S. C. §1395oo(a)(3). By regula-\n  tion, the Secretary of HHS authorized the PRRB to extend the 180-\n  day limit, for good cause, up to three years. See 42 CFR 405.1841(b)\n  (2007).\n     The Baystate Medical Center—not a party here—timely appealed\n  its SSI fraction calculation for each year from 1993 through 1996.\n  The PRRB found that errors in CMS’s methodology resulted in a sys-\n  tematic undercalculation of the disproportionate share adjustment\n  and corresponding underpayments to providers. In March 2006, the\n  Board’s Baystate decision was made public. Within 180 days, re-\n  spondent hospitals filed a complaint with the Board, challenging\n  their adjustments for 1987 through 1994. Acknowledging that their\n  challenges were more than a decade out of time, they urged that eq-\n2       SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    uitable tolling of the limitations period was in order due to CMS’s\n    failure to tell them about the computation error. The PRRB held that\n    it lacked jurisdiction, reasoning that it had no equitable powers save\n    those legislation or regulation might confer. On judicial review, the\n    District Court dismissed the hospitals’ claims. The D. C. Circuit re-\n    versed. The presumption that statutory limitations periods are gen-\n    erally subject to equitable tolling, the court concluded, applied to the\n    180-day time limit because nothing in §1395oo(a)(3) indicated that\n    Congress intended to disallow such tolling.\nHeld:\n    1. The 180-day limitation in §1395oo(a)(3) is not “jurisdictional.”\n Pp. 6–9.\n       (a) Unless Congress has “clearly state[d]” that a statutory limita-\n tion is jurisdictional, the restriction should be treated “as nonjuris-\n dictional.” Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 515–516.\n “[C]ontext, including this Court’s interpretations of similar provisions\n in many years past,” is probative of whether Congress intended a\n particular provision to rank as jurisdictional. Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.\n Muchnick, 559 U. S. ___, ___. If §1395oo(a)(3) were jurisdictional, the\n 180-day time limit could not be enlarged by agency or court.\n    Section 1395oo(a)(3) hardly reveals a design to preclude any regu-\n latory extension. The provision instructs that a provider “may obtain\n a hearing” by filing “a request . . . within 180 days after notice of the\n intermediary’s final determination.” It “does not speak in jurisdic-\n tional terms.” Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394.\n This Court has repeatedly held that filing deadlines ordinarily are\n not jurisdictional; indeed, they have been described as “quintessen-\n tial claim-processing rules.” Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. ___,\n ___. Pp. 6–8.\n       (b) Court-appointed amicus urges that §1395oo(a)(3) should be\n classified as a jurisdictional requirement based on its proximity to\n §§1395oo(a)(1) and (a)(2), both jurisdictional requirements, amicus\n asserts. But a requirement that would otherwise be nonjurisdictional\n does not become jurisdictional simply because it is in a section of a\n statute that also contains jurisdictional provisions. Gonzalez v. Tha-\n ler, 565 U. S. ___, ___. Amicus also urges that the Medicare Act’s ex-\n press grant of authority for the Secretary to extend the time for bene-\n ficiary appeals implies the absence of such leeway for §1395oo(a)(3)’s\n provider appeals. In support, amicus relies on the general rule that\n Congress’s use of “certain language in one part of the statute and dif-\n ferent language in another” can indicate that “different meanings\n were intended,” Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9.\n But that interpretive guide, like other canons of construction, is “no\n more than [a] rul[e] of thumb” that can tip the scales when a statute\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

Here, §1395oo(a)’s limitation is most sensibly\ncharacterized as nonjurisdictional. Pp. 8–9.\n   2. The Secretary’s regulation is a permissible interpretation of\n§1395oo(a)(3). Pp. 10–14.\n      (a) Congress vested in the Secretary large rulemaking authority\nto administer Medicare. A court lacks authority to undermine the\nSecretary’s regime unless her regulation is “arbitrary, capricious, or\nmanifestly contrary to the statute.” Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844. Here, the regula-\ntion survives inspection under that deferential standard. The Secre-\ntary brought to bear practical experience in superintending the huge\nprogram generally, and the PRRB in particular, in maintaining a\nthree-year outer limit for intermediary determination challenges. A\ncourt must uphold her judgment as long as it is a permissible con-\nstruction of the statute, even if the court would have interpreted the\nstatute differently absent agency regulation. Pp. 10–11.\n      (b) A presumption of equitable tolling generally applies to suits\nagainst the United States, Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112510\"><a href=\"/scotus/zrQ/irwin-v-department-of-veterans-affairs/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95–96, but application of this presumption is not in or-\nder for §1395oo(a)(3). This Court has never applied Irwin’s presump-\ntion to an agency’s internal appeal deadline. The presumption was\nadopted in part on the premise that “[s]uch a principle is likely to be\na realistic assessment of legislative intent.” Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95.\nThat premise is inapt in the context of providers’ administrative ap-\npeals under the Medicare Act. For nearly 40 years the Secretary has\nprohibited the Board from extending the 180-day deadline, except as\nprovided by regulation. In the six times §1395oo has been amended\nsince 1974, Congress has left untouched the 180-day provision and\nthe Secretary’s rulemaking authority. Furthermore, the statutory\nscheme, which applies to sophisticated institutional providers, is not\ndesigned to be “ ‘unusually protective’ of claimants.” Bowen v. City of\nNew York, 476 U. S. 467, 480. Nor is the scheme one “in which lay-\nmen, unassisted by trained lawyers, initiate the process.” Zipes, 455\nU. S., at 397.\n   The hospitals ultimately argue that the Secretary’s regulations fail\nto adhere to “fundamentals of fair play.” FCC v. Pottsville Broadcast-\ning Co., 309 U. S. 134, 143. They point to 42 CFR §405.1885(b)(3),\nwhich permits reopening of an intermediary’s reimbursement deter-\nmination “at any time” if the determination was procured by fraud or\nfault of the provider. But this Court has explained that giving inter-\nmediaries more time to discover overpayments than providers have to\ndiscover underpayments may be justified by the “administrative real-\nities” of the system: a few dozen fiscal intermediaries are charged\n4       SEBELIUS v.

AU-\n\n    BURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 22, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns the time within which health care\nproviders may file an administrative appeal from the\ninitial determination of the reimbursement due them for\ninpatient services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.\nGovernment contractors, called fiscal intermediaries,\nreceive cost reports annually from care providers and\nnotify them of the reimbursement amount for which they\nqualify. A provider dissatisfied with the fiscal intermedi-\nary’s determination may appeal to an administrative body\nnamed the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB\nor Board). The governing statute, §602(h)(l)(D), 97 Stat.\n165, 42 U. S. C. §1395oo(a)(3), sets a 180-day limit for\nfiling appeals from the fiscal intermediary to the PRRB.\nBy a regulation promulgated in 1974, the Secretary of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) author-\nized the Board to extend the 180-day limitation, for good\ncause, up to three years.1\n——————\n 1 The agency was called the Department of Health, Education, and\n\nWelfare until 1979, but for simplicity’s sake we refer to it as HHS\n2     SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   The providers in this case are hospitals who appealed to\nthe PRRB more than ten years after expiration of the 180-\nday statutory deadline. They assert that the Secretary’s\nfailure to disclose information that made the fiscal inter-\nmediary’s reimbursement calculation incorrect prevented\nthem from earlier appealing to the Board. Three positions\nhave been briefed and argued regarding the time for pro-\nviders’ appeals to the PRRB. First, a Court-appointed\namicus curiae has urged that the 180-day limitation is\n“jurisdictional,” and therefore cannot be enlarged at all by\nagency or court. Second, the Government maintains that\nthe Secretary has the prerogative to set an outer limit of\nthree years for appeals to the Board. And third, the hos-\npitals argue that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies,\nstopping the 180-day clock during the time the Secretary\nconcealed the information that made the fiscal interme-\ndiary’s reimbursement determinations incorrect.\n   We hold that the statutory 180-day limitation is not\n“jurisdictional,” and that the Secretary reasonably con-\nstrued the statute to permit a regulation extending the\ntime for a provider’s appeal to the PRRB to three years.\nWe further hold that the presumption in favor of equitable\ntolling does not apply to administrative appeals of the\nkind here at issue.\n                             I\n  The Medicare program covers certain inpatient services\nthat hospitals provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Provid-\ners are reimbursed at a fixed amount per patient, regard-\nless of the actual operating costs they incur in rendering\nthese services. But the total reimbursement amount is\nadjusted upward for hospitals that serve a disproportion-\nate share of low-income patients. This adjustment is\nmade because hospitals with an unusually high percent-\n——————\nthroughout this opinion.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

See H. R.\nRep. No. 99–241, pt. 1, p. 16 (1985). The amount of the\ndisproportionate share adjustment is determined in part\nby the percentage of the patients served by the hospital\nwho are eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI)\npayments, a percentage commonly called the SSI fraction.\n42 U. S. C. §1395ww(d) (2006 ed. and Supp. V).\n  At the end of each year, providers participating in Medi-\ncare submit cost reports to contractors acting on behalf of\nHHS known as fiscal intermediaries. Also at year end,\nthe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) cal-\nculates the SSI fraction for each eligible hospital and\nsubmits that number to the intermediary for that hospital.\nUsing these numbers to determine the total payment due,\nthe intermediary issues a Notice of Program Reimburse-\nment (NPR) informing the provider how much it will be\npaid for the year.\n  If a provider is dissatisfied with the intermediary’s re-\nimbursement determination, the statute gives it the right\nto file a request for a hearing before the PRRB within\n180 days of receiving the NPR. §1395oo(a)(3) (2006 ed.)\nIn 1974, the Secretary promulgated a regulation, after\nnotice and comment rulemaking, permitting the Board to\nextend the 180-day time limit upon a showing of good\ncause; the regulation further provides that “no such exten-\nsion shall be granted by the Board if such request is filed\nmore than 3 years after the date the notice of the interme-\ndiary’s determination is mailed to the provider.” 39 Fed.\nReg. 34517 (1974) (codified in 42 CFR §405.1841(b)\n(2007)).2\n——————\n  2 In 2008, after this case commenced, the Secretary replaced the 1974\n\nregulation with a new prescription limiting “good cause” to “extraordi-\nnary circumstances beyond [the provider’s] control (such as a natural or\n4     SEBELIUS v.

Eventually, the\nPRRB determined that CMS had omitted several catego-\nries of SSI data from its calculations and was using a\nflawed process to determine the number of low-income\nbeneficiaries treated by hospitals. These errors caused a\nsystematic undercalculation of the disproportionate share\nadjustment, resulting in underpayments to the providers.\nBaystate Medical Center v.

In March 2006, the Board’s decision in\nthe Baystate case was made public. Within 180 days, the\nhospitals in this case filed a complaint with the Board\nseeking to challenge their disproportionate share adjust-\nments for the years 1987 through 1994. The hospitals\nacknowledged that their challenges, unlike Baystate’s\ntimely contest, were more than a decade out of time.

The parties agree that\nthis case is governed by the 1974 regulation, and our opinion today\naddresses only that regulation.\n  3 In §951 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Mod-\n\nernization Act of 2003, 117 Stat. 2427, Congress required the Secretary\nto furnish hospitals with the data necessary to compute their own\ndisproportionate share adjustment.

It relied on the presumption that statutory limita-\ntions periods are generally subject to equitable tolling and\nreasoned that “ ‘the same rebuttable presumption of equi-\ntable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants\nshould also apply to suits against the United States.’ ” Id.,\nat 1148 (quoting Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,\n498 U. S. 89, 95–96 (1990)). The presumption applies\nto the 180-day time limit for provider appeals from re-\nimbursement determinations, the Court of Appeals held,\nfinding nothing in the statutory provision for PRRB re-\nview indicating that Congress intended to disallow equi-\ntable tolling. 642 F. 3d, at 1149–1151.\n   We granted the Secretary’s petition for certiorari, 567\nU. S. ___ (2012), to resolve a conflict among the Courts of\nAppeals over whether the 180-day time limit in 42 U. S. C.\n§1395oo(a)(3) constricts the Board’s jurisdiction. Compare\n642 F. 3d 1145 (case below); Western Medical Enterprises,\nInc. v. Heckler, 783 F. 2d 1376, 1379–1380 (CA9\n1986) (180-day limit is not jurisdictional and the Secretary\nmay extend it for good cause), with Alacare Home Health\nServs., Inc. v.

Beyond the juris-\ndictional inquiry,4 the Secretary asked us to determine\nwhether the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that\nequitable tolling applies to providers’ Medicare reim-\nbursement appeals to the PRRB, notwithstanding the\nSecretary’s regulation barring such appeals after three\nyears.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   Characterizing a rule as jurisdictional renders it unique\nin our adversarial system. Objections to a tribunal’s ju-\nrisdiction can be raised at any time, even by a party that\nonce conceded the tribunal’s subject-matter jurisdiction\nover the controversy. Tardy jurisdictional objections can\ntherefore result in a waste of adjudicatory resources and\ncan disturbingly disarm litigants. See Henderson v.\nShinseki, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5); Arbaugh\nv. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006). With these\nuntoward consequences in mind, “we have tried in recent\ncases to bring some discipline to the use” of the term\n“jurisdiction.” Henderson, 562 U.

Thaler, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6); Hender-\nson, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). This is not to say that\nCongress must incant magic words in order to speak\nclearly. We consider “context, including this Court’s inter-\npretations of similar provisions in many years past,” as\nprobative of whether Congress intended a particular\nprovision to rank as jurisdictional. Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.\nMuchnick, 559 U. S. 154, 168 (2010); see also John R.\nSand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133–\n134 (2008).\n   We reiterate what it would mean were we to type the gov-\nerning statute, 42 U. S. C. §1395oo(a)(3), “jurisdictional.”\nUnder no circumstance could providers engage PRRB re-\nview more than 180 days after notice of the fiscal inter-\nmediary’s final determination. Not only could there be no\nequitable tolling. The Secretary’s regulation providing for\na good-cause extension, see supra, at 3, would fall as well.\n   The language Congress used hardly reveals a design to\npreclude any regulatory extension. Section 1395oo(a)(3)\ninstructs that a provider of services “may obtain a hear-\ning” by the Board regarding its reimbursement amount if\n“such provider files a request for a hearing within 180\ndays after notice of the intermediary’s final determina-\ntion.” This provision “does not speak in jurisdictional\nterms.” Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385,\n394 (1982). Indeed, it is less “jurisdictional” in tone than\nthe provision we held to be nonjurisdictional in Henderson.\nThere, the statute provided that a veteran seeking Veter-\nans Court review of the Department of Veterans Affairs’\ndetermination of disability benefits “shall file a notice of\nappeal . . . within 120 days.” 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n9) (quoting 38 U. S. C. §7266(a) (emphasis added)). Sec-\ntion 1395oo(a)(3), by contrast, contains neither the manda-\ntory word “shall” nor the appellation “notice of appeal,”\n8    SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwords with jurisdictional import in the context of 28\nU. S. C. §2107’s limitations on the time for appeal from a\ndistrict court to a court of appeals. See Bowles v. Russell,\n551 U. S. 205, 214 (2007).\n   Key to our decision, we have repeatedly held that filing\ndeadlines ordinarily are not jurisdictional; indeed, we have\ndescribed them as “quintessential claim-processing rules.”\nHenderson, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6); see also Scar-\nborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 414 (2004) (filing dead-\nline for fee applications under Equal Access to Justice\nAct); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 454 (2004) (filing\ndeadlines for objecting to debtor’s discharge in bank-\nruptcy); Honda v. Clark, 386 U. S. 484, 498 (1967) (filing\ndeadline for claims under the Trading with the Enemy\nAct). This case is scarcely the exceptional one in which a “cen-\ntury’s worth of precedent and practice in American courts”\nrank a time limit as jurisdictional. Bowles, 551 U. S., at\n209, n. 2; cf. Kontrick, 540 U. S., at 454 (a time limitation\nmay be emphatic, yet not jurisdictional).\n                               B\n  Amicus urges that the three requirements in §1395oo(a)\nare specifications that together define the limits of the\nPRRB’s jurisdiction. Subsection (a)(1) specifies the claims\nproviders may bring to the Board, and subsection (a)(2)\nsets forth an amount-in-controversy requirement. These\nare jurisdictional requirements, amicus asserts, so we\nshould read the third specification, subsection (a)(3)’s\n180-day limitation, as also setting a jurisdictional\nrequirement.\n  Last Term, we rejected a similar proximity-based argu-\nment. A requirement we would otherwise classify as\nnonjurisdictional, we held, does not become jurisdictional\nsimply because it is placed in a section of a statute that\nalso contains jurisdictional provisions. Gonzalez, 565\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11); see Weinberger v. Salfi, 422\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 749, 763–764 (1975) (statutory provision at issue\ncontained three requirements for judicial review, only one\nof which was jurisdictional).\n   Amicus also argues that the 180-day time limit for pro-\nvider appeals to the PRRB should be viewed as jurisdic-\ntional because Congress could have expressly made the\nprovision nonjurisdictional, and indeed did so for other\ntime limits in the Medicare Act. Amicus notes particularly\nthat when Medicare beneficiaries request the Secretary\nto reconsider a benefits determination, the statute gives\nthem a time limit of 180 days or “such additional time as\nthe Secretary may allow.” 42 U. S. C. §1395ff(b)(1)(D)(i);\nsee also §1395ff(b)(1)(D)(ii) (permitting Medicare benefi-\nciary to request a hearing by the Secretary within “time\nlimits” the Secretary “shall establish in regulations”). We\nhave recognized, as a general rule, that Congress’s use of\n“certain language in one part of the statute and different\nlanguage in another” can indicate that “different meanings\nwere intended.” Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692,\n711, n. 9 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Ami-\ncus notes this general rule in urging that an express grant\nof authority for the Secretary to extend the time for bene-\nficiary appeals implies the absence of such leeway for\nprovider appeals.\n   But the interpretive guide just identified, like other\ncanons of construction, is “no more than [a] rul[e] of\nthumb” that can tip the scales when a statute could be\nread in multiple ways. Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain,\n503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992). For the reasons earlier stated,\nsee supra, at 6–8, we are persuaded that the time limi-\ntation in §1395oo(a) is most sensibly characterized as a\nnonjurisdictional prescription. The limitation therefore\ndoes not bar the modest extension contained in the Secre-\ntary’s regulation.\n10    SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              III\n  We turn now to the question whether §1395oo(a)(3)’s\n180-day time limit for a provider to appeal to the PRRB is\nsubject to equitable tolling.\n                            A\n  Congress vested in the Secretary large rulemaking\nauthority to administer the Medicare program. The PRRB\nmay adopt rules and procedures only if “not inconsistent”\nwith the Medicare Act or “regulations of the Secretary.”\n42 U. S. C. §1395oo(e). Concerning the 180-day period\nfor an appeal to the Board from an intermediary’s reim-\nbursement determination, the Secretary’s regulation im-\nplementing §1395oo, adopted after notice and comment,\nspeaks in no uncertain terms:\n     “A request for a Board hearing filed after [the 180-day\n     time limit] shall be dismissed by the Board, except\n     that for good cause shown, the time limit may be ex-\n     tended. However, no such extension shall be granted\n     by the Board if such request is filed more than 3 years\n     after the date the notice of the intermediary’s deter-\n     mination is mailed to the provider.” 42 CFR\n     §405.1841(b) (2007).\n  The Secretary allowed only a distinctly limited exten-\nsion of time to appeal to the PRRB, cognizant that “the\nBoard is burdened by an immense caseload,” and that\n“procedural rules requiring timely filings are indispens-\nable devices for keeping the machinery of the reimburse-\nment appeals process running smoothly.” High Country\nHome Health, Inc. v. Thompson, 359 F. 3d 1307, 1310\n(CA10 2004). Imposing equitable tolling to permit appeals\nbarred by the Secretary’s regulation would essentially gut\nthe Secretary’s requirement that an appeal to the Board\n“shall be dismissed” if filed more than 180 days after the\nNPR, unless the provider shows “good cause” and requests\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nan extension no later than three years after the NPR. A\ncourt lacks authority to undermine the regime established\nby the Secretary unless her regulation is “arbitrary, capri-\ncious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.” Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 844 (1984).\n   The Secretary’s regulation, we are satisfied, survives\ninspection under that deferential standard. As HHS has\nexplained, “[i]t is in the interest of providers and the pro-\ngram that, at some point, intermediary determinations\nand the resulting amount of program payment due the\nprovider or the program become no longer open to correc-\ntion.” CMS, Medicare: Provider Reimbursement Manual,\npt. 1, ch. 29, §2930, p. 29–73 (rev. no. 372, 2011); cf. Taylor\nv. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 644 (1992) (“Deadlines\nmay lead to unwelcome results, but they prompt parties\nto act and produce finality.”). The Secretary brought to\nbear practical experience in superintending the huge pro-\ngram generally, and the PRRB in particular, in maintaining\nthree years as the outer limit. A court must uphold the\nSecretary’s judgment as long as it is a permissible con-\nstruction of the statute, even if it differs from how the\ncourt would have interpreted the statute in the absence of\nan agency regulation. National Cable & Telecommunica-\ntions Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 980\n(2005); see also Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843, n. 11.\n                              B\n  Rejecting the Secretary’s position, the Court of Appeals\nrelied principally on this Court’s decision in Irwin, 498\nU. S., at 95–96. Irwin concerned the then 30-day time\nperiod for filing suit against a federal agency under Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–\n16(c) (1988 ed.). We held in Irwin that “the same rebut-\ntable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits\nagainst private defendants should also apply to suits\n12   SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst the United States.” 498 U. S., at 95–96. Irwin\nitself, and equitable-tolling cases we have considered both\npre- and post-Irwin, have generally involved time limits\nfor filing suit in federal court. See, e.g., Holland v. Flor-\nida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010) (one-year limitation for filing\napplication for writ of habeas corpus); Rotella v. Wood, 528\nU. S. 549 (2000) (four-year period for filing civil RICO\nsuit); United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38 (1998) (12-\nyear period to bring suit under Quiet Title Act); Lampf,\nPleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S.\n350 (1991) (one- and three-year periods for commencing\ncivil action under §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934); Honda v. Clark, 386 U. S. 484 (1967) (60-day period\nfor filing suit under Trading with the Enemy Act); Kendall\nv. United States, 107 U. S. 123 (1883) (six-year period for\nfiling suit in Court of Claims). Courts in those cases ren-\ndered in the first instance the decision whether equity\nrequired tolling.\n   This case is of a different order. We have never applied\nthe Irwin presumption to an agency’s internal appeal dead-\nline, here the time a provider has to appeal an inter-\nmediary’s reimbursement determination to the PRRB. Cf.\nUnited States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S. 347, 350 (1997)\n(assuming, arguendo, that Irwin presumption applied to\ntime limit for filing an administrative claim for a tax re-\nfund, but concluding based on statutory text, structure,\nand purpose that there was “good reason to believe that\nCongress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to\napply”).\n   The presumption of equitable tolling was adopted in\npart on the premise that “[s]uch a principle is likely to be\na realistic assessment of legislative intent.” Irwin, 498\nU. S., at 95. But that premise is inapt in the context of\nproviders’ administrative appeals under the Medicare Act.\nThe Act, until 1972, provided no avenue for providers to\nobtain administrative or judicial review. When Congress\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfirst directed the Secretary to establish the PRRB, Con-\ngress simultaneously imposed the 180-day deadline, with\nno statutory exceptions. For nearly 40 years the Secre-\ntary has prohibited the Board from extending that dead-\nline, except as provided by regulation. And until the D. C.\nCircuit’s decision in this case, no court had ever read\nequitable tolling into §1395oo(a)(3) or the Secretary’s\nimplementation of that provision. Congress amended\n§1395oo six times since 1974, each time leaving untouched\nthe 180-day administrative appeal provision and the\nSecretary’s rulemaking authority. At no time did Con-\ngress express disapproval of the three-year outer time\nlimit set by the Secretary for an extension upon a showing\nof good cause. See Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v.\nSchor, 478 U. S. 833, 846 (1986) (“[W]hen Congress revisits\na statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative\ninterpretation without pertinent change, the congressional\nfailure to revise or repeal the agency’s interpretation is\npersuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one in-\ntended by Congress.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   We note, furthermore, that unlike the remedial statutes\nat issue in many of this Court’s equitable-tolling decisions,\nsee Irwin, 498 U. S., at 91; Bowen v. City of New York, 476\nU. S. 467, 480 (1986); Zipes, 455 U. S., at 398, the statu-\ntory scheme before us is not designed to be “ ‘unusually\nprotective’ of claimants.” Bowen, 476 U. S., at 480. Nor is\nit one “in which laymen, unassisted by trained lawyers,\ninitiate the process.” Zipes, 455 U. S., at 397 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Medicare payment system\nin question applies to “sophisticated” institutional pro-\nviders assisted by legal counsel, and “generally capable\nof identifying an underpayment in [their] own NPR\nwithin the 180-day time period specified in 42 U. S. C.\n§1395oo(a)(3).” Your Home Visiting Nurse Services, Inc. v.\nShalala, 525 U. S. 449, 456 (1999). As repeat players who\nelect to participate in the Medicare system, providers can\n14    SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhardly claim lack of notice of the Secretary’s regulations.\n  The hospitals ultimately argue that the Secretary’s\nregulations fail to adhere to the “fundamentals of fair\nplay.” FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S.\n134, 143 (1940). They point, particularly, to 42 CFR\n§405.1885(b)(3) (2012), which permits reopening of an\nintermediary’s reimbursement determination “at any time\nif it is established that such determination . . . was\nprocured by fraud or similar fault of any party to the\ndetermination.”5\n  We considered a similar alleged inequity in Your Home\nand explained that it was justified by the “administrative\nrealities” of the provider reimbursement appeal system.\n525 U. S., at 455. There are only a few dozen fiscal inter-\nmediaries and they are charged with issuing tens of thou-\nsands of NPRs, while each provider can concentrate on\na single NPR, its own. Id., at 456. The Secretary, Your\nHome concluded, could reasonably believe that this asym-\nmetry justifies giving the intermediaries more time to\ndiscover overpayments than the providers have to discover\nunderpayments. Moreover, the fraud exception allowing\nindefinite reopening does apply to an intermediary if it\n“procured” a Board decision by “fraud or similar fault.”\nAlthough an intermediary is not a party to its own deter-\nmination, it does rank as a party in proceedings before the\nBoard. 42 CFR §405.1843(a).6\n\n\n——————\n  5 Because neither the Secretary nor the intermediary counts as a\n\nparty to the intermediary’s determination, 42 CFR §405.1805, providers\nalone are subject to this exception to the time limitation.\n  6 The fraud exception apart, reopening time is limited to three years.\n\n§405.1885(a). Within that time, reopening may be sought by the\nintermediary, the Board, the Secretary, or the provider. Thus an\nintermediary determination or Board decision could not be reopened if,\noutside the three-year window, the Secretary discovered errors in\ncalculating the SSI fraction that resulted in overpayments to providers.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                        *    *     *\n  We hold, in sum, that the 180-day statutory deadline\nfor administrative appeals to the PRRB, contained in 42\nU. S. C. §1395oo(a)(3), is not “jurisdictional.” Therefore\nthe Secretary lawfully exercised her rulemaking authority\nin providing for a three-year “good cause” extension. We\nfurther hold that the equitable tolling presumption our\nIrwin decision approved for suits brought in court does not\nsimilarly apply to administrative appeals of the kind\nhere considered, and that the Secretary’s regulation, 42\nCFR §405.1841(b), is a permissible interpretation of the\nstatute.\n   The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia Circuit is therefore reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

AU-\n\n    BURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                      [January 22, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring.\n   The Court holds that the presumption in favor of equi-\ntable tolling that we adopted in Irwin v. Department of\nVeterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95–96 (1990), does not\napply to 42 U. S. C. §1395oo(a)(3)’s nonjurisdictional 180-\nday deadline for health care providers to file administra-\ntive appeals with the Provider Reimbursement Review\nBoard (PRRB), and that the Secretary’s regulation limit-\ning “good cause” extensions of that deadline to three years\nis a permissible interpretation of the statute. I agree with\nthose holdings and join the Court’s opinion in full. I write\nseparately to note that the Court’s decision in this case\ndoes not establish that equitable tolling principles are\nirrelevant to internal administrative deadlines in all, or\neven most, contexts.\n   The Court is correct that our equitable tolling cases\nhave typically involved deadlines to bring suit in federal\ncourt. Ante, at 12. But we have never suggested that\nthe presumption in favor of equitable tolling is generally\ninapplicable to administrative deadlines. Cf. Henderson v.\nShinseki, 562 U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2011) (slip op., at 12,\nn. 4) (noting that the Government did not dispute whether\nthe statutory filing deadline in the Article I Veterans\nCourt was subject to equitable tolling if the deadline was\n2    SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nnonjurisdictional); United States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S.\n347, 350–353 (1997) (assuming without deciding that the\nIrwin presumption applied to administrative tax refund\nclaims but finding based on statutory text, structure, and\nthe underlying subject matter that tolling was unavail-\nable); see also ante, at 12 (discussing Brockamp). And we\nhave previously applied the Irwin presumption outside the\ncontext of filing deadlines in Article III courts. See Young\nv. United States, 535 U. S. 43, 49–53 (2002) (applying the\npresumption to a limitations period in bankruptcy pro-\nceedings); cf. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S.\n385, 392–398 (1982) (holding that the statutory time limit\nfor filing charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission was “not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit\nin federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of\nlimitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable\ntolling”).\n   In administrative settings other than the one presented\nhere, I believe the “background principle” that limita-\ntions periods “are customarily subject to equitable tolling,”\nYoung, 535 U. S., at 49–50 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), may limit an agency’s discretion to make filing\ndeadlines absolute. The Court quite properly observes\nthat the question whether equitable tolling is available\nturns on congressional intent. See ante, at 13. “[A] realis-\ntic assessment” of that intent, Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95, may\nvary by context.\n   In this case, given the nature of the statutory scheme,\nwhich “applies to ‘sophisticated’ institutional providers”\nwho are “repeat players” in the Medicare system, and the\nstatute’s history, I agree that it would distort congres-\nsional intent to presume that the PRRB’s administrative\ndeadline should be subject to equitable tolling. Ante, at\n12–14 (quoting Your Home Visiting Nurse Services, Inc. v.\nShalala, 525 U. S. 449, 456 (1999)). By contrast, with\nrespect to remedial statutes designed to protect the rights\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nof unsophisticated claimants, see ante, at 13, agencies\n(and reviewing courts) may best honor congressional\nintent by presuming that statutory deadlines for admin-\nistrative appeals are subject to equitable tolling, just as\ncourts presume comparable judicial deadlines under such\nstatutes may be tolled. Because claimants must generally\npursue administrative relief before seeking judicial re-\nview, see Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. 81, 88–91 (2006), a\ncontrary approach could have odd practical consequences\nand would attribute a strange intent to Congress: to pro-\ntect a claimant’s ability to seek judicial review of an agen-\ncy’s decision by making equitable tolling available, while\nleaving to the agency’s discretion whether the same claim-\nant may invoke equitable tolling in order to seek an ad-\nministrative remedy in the first place.\n   Even in cases where the governing statute clearly dele-\ngates to an agency the discretion to adopt rules that limit\nthe scope of equitable exceptions to administrative dead-\nlines, I believe “cases may arise where the equities in\nfavor of tolling the limitations period are ‘so great that\ndeference to the agency’s judgment is inappropriate.’ ”\nBowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S. 467, 480 (1986)\n(quoting Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 330 (1976)).\nIn particular, efforts by an agency to enforce tight filing\ndeadlines in cases where there are credible allegations\nthat filing delay was due to the agency’s own misfea-\nsance may not survive deferential review. While equitable\ntolling extends to circumstances outside both parties’\ncontrol, the related doctrines of equitable estoppel and\nfraudulent concealment may bar a defendant from enforc-\ning a statute of limitation when its own deception pre-\nvented a reasonably diligent plaintiff from bringing a\ntimely claim. See United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38,\n49–50 (1998) (Stevens, J., concurring) (noting that these\ndoctrines are distinct); see generally 2 C. Corman, Limita-\ntion of Actions §§9.1, 9.7 (1991) (describing the doctrines).\n4    SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nIn Bowen, we applied the basic principle underlying these\ndoctrines to an agency’s conduct, as we concluded that a\n60-day deadline to seek judicial review of the administra-\ntive denial of disability benefits should be tolled because\nthe Social Security Administration’s “‘secretive conduct pre-\nvent[ed] plaintiffs from knowing of a violation of rights.’ ”\n476 U. S., at 481 (quoting New York v. Heckler, 742 F. 2d\n729, 738 (CA2 1984)).\n   While the providers in this case allege that the agency’s\nfailure to disclose information about how it calculated the\nSupplemental Security Income fraction prevented them\nfrom bringing timely challenges to reimbursement de-\nterminations, I am satisfied that the Secretary’s 3-year\ngood-cause exception is a reasonable accommodation of the\ncompeting interests in administrative efficiency and fair-\nness. We would face a different case if the Secretary’s\nregulation did not recognize an exception for good cause or\ndefined good cause so narrowly as to exclude cases of\nfraudulent concealment and equitable estoppel. See ante,\nat 3, n. 2 (explaining that the Secretary’s amended regula-\ntion limiting the scope of “ ‘good cause,’ ” 73 Fed.

AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL\n\n                 CENTER ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n No. 11–1231. Argued December 4, 2012—Decided January 22, 2013\nThe reimbursement amount health care providers receive for inpatient\n  services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries is adjusted upward for\n  hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.\n  The adjustment amount is determined in part by the percentage of a\n  hospital’s patients who are eligible for Supplemental Security Income\n  (SSI), called the SSI fraction. Each year, the Centers for Medicare &\n  Medicaid Services (CMS) calculates the SSI fraction for an eligible\n  hospital and submits that number to the hospital’s “fiscal intermedi-\n  ary,” a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) contractor.\n  The intermediary computes the reimbursement amount due and then\n  sends the hospital a Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR). A\n  provider dissatisfied with the determination has a right to appeal to\n  the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB or Board) within\n  180 days of receiving the NPR. 42 U. S. C. §1395oo(a)(3). By regula-\n  tion, the Secretary of HHS authorized the PRRB to extend the 180-\n  day limit, for good cause, up to three years. See 42 CFR 405.1841(b)\n  (2007).\n     The Baystate Medical Center—not a party here—timely appealed\n  its SSI fraction calculation for each year from 1993 through 1996.\n  The PRRB found that errors in CMS’s methodology resulted in a sys-\n  tematic undercalculation of the disproportionate share adjustment\n  and corresponding underpayments to providers. In March 2006, the\n  Board’s Baystate decision was made public. Within 180 days, re-\n  spondent hospitals filed a complaint with the Board, challenging\n  their adjustments for 1987 through 1994. Acknowledging that their\n  challenges were more than a decade out of time, they urged that eq-\n2       SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    uitable tolling of the limitations period was in order due to CMS’s\n    failure to tell them about the computation error. The PRRB held that\n    it lacked jurisdiction, reasoning that it had no equitable powers save\n    those legislation or regulation might confer. On judicial review, the\n    District Court dismissed the hospitals’ claims. The D. C. Circuit re-\n    versed. The presumption that statutory limitations periods are gen-\n    erally subject to equitable tolling, the court concluded, applied to the\n    180-day time limit because nothing in §1395oo(a)(3) indicated that\n    Congress intended to disallow such tolling.\nHeld:\n    1. The 180-day limitation in §1395oo(a)(3) is not “jurisdictional.”\n Pp. 6–9.\n       (a) Unless Congress has “clearly state[d]” that a statutory limita-\n tion is jurisdictional, the restriction should be treated “as nonjuris-\n dictional.” Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 515–516.\n “[C]ontext, including this Court’s interpretations of similar provisions\n in many years past,” is probative of whether Congress intended a\n particular provision to rank as jurisdictional. Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.\n Muchnick, 559 U. S. ___, ___. If §1395oo(a)(3) were jurisdictional, the\n 180-day time limit could not be enlarged by agency or court.\n    Section 1395oo(a)(3) hardly reveals a design to preclude any regu-\n latory extension. The provision instructs that a provider “may obtain\n a hearing” by filing “a request . . . within 180 days after notice of the\n intermediary’s final determination.” It “does not speak in jurisdic-\n tional terms.” Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394.\n This Court has repeatedly held that filing deadlines ordinarily are\n not jurisdictional; indeed, they have been described as “quintessen-\n tial claim-processing rules.” Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. ___,\n ___. Pp. 6–8.\n       (b) Court-appointed amicus urges that §1395oo(a)(3) should be\n classified as a jurisdictional requirement based on its proximity to\n §§1395oo(a)(1) and (a)(2), both jurisdictional requirements, amicus\n asserts. But a requirement that would otherwise be nonjurisdictional\n does not become jurisdictional simply because it is in a section of a\n statute that also contains jurisdictional provisions. Gonzalez v. Tha-\n ler, 565 U. S. ___, ___. Amicus also urges that the Medicare Act’s ex-\n press grant of authority for the Secretary to extend the time for bene-\n ficiary appeals implies the absence of such leeway for §1395oo(a)(3)’s\n provider appeals. In support, amicus relies on the general rule that\n Congress’s use of “certain language in one part of the statute and dif-\n ferent language in another” can indicate that “different meanings\n were intended,” Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9.\n But that interpretive guide, like other canons of construction, is “no\n more than [a] rul[e] of thumb” that can tip the scales when a statute\n                   Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                             Syllabus\n\ncould be read in multiple ways. Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain,\n503 U. S. 249, 253. Here, §1395oo(a)’s limitation is most sensibly\ncharacterized as nonjurisdictional. Pp. 8–9.\n   2. The Secretary’s regulation is a permissible interpretation of\n§1395oo(a)(3). Pp. 10–14.\n      (a) Congress vested in the Secretary large rulemaking authority\nto administer Medicare. A court lacks authority to undermine the\nSecretary’s regime unless her regulation is “arbitrary, capricious, or\nmanifestly contrary to the statute.” Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844. Here, the regula-\ntion survives inspection under that deferential standard. The Secre-\ntary brought to bear practical experience in superintending the huge\nprogram generally, and the PRRB in particular, in maintaining a\nthree-year outer limit for intermediary determination challenges. A\ncourt must uphold her judgment as long as it is a permissible con-\nstruction of the statute, even if the court would have interpreted the\nstatute differently absent agency regulation. Pp. 10–11.\n      (b) A presumption of equitable tolling generally applies to suits\nagainst the United States, Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,\n498 U.S. 89, 95–96, but application of this presumption is not in or-\nder for §1395oo(a)(3). This Court has never applied Irwin’s presump-\ntion to an agency’s internal appeal deadline. The presumption was\nadopted in part on the premise that “[s]uch a principle is likely to be\na realistic assessment of legislative intent.” Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95.\nThat premise is inapt in the context of providers’ administrative ap-\npeals under the Medicare Act. For nearly 40 years the Secretary has\nprohibited the Board from extending the 180-day deadline, except as\nprovided by regulation. In the six times §1395oo has been amended\nsince 1974, Congress has left untouched the 180-day provision and\nthe Secretary’s rulemaking authority. Furthermore, the statutory\nscheme, which applies to sophisticated institutional providers, is not\ndesigned to be “ ‘unusually protective’ of claimants.” Bowen v. City of\nNew York, 476 U. S. 467, 480. Nor is the scheme one “in which lay-\nmen, unassisted by trained lawyers, initiate the process.” Zipes, 455\nU. S., at 397.\n   The hospitals ultimately argue that the Secretary’s regulations fail\nto adhere to “fundamentals of fair play.” FCC v. Pottsville Broadcast-\ning Co., 309 U. S. 134, 143. They point to 42 CFR §405.1885(b)(3),\nwhich permits reopening of an intermediary’s reimbursement deter-\nmination “at any time” if the determination was procured by fraud or\nfault of the provider. But this Court has explained that giving inter-\nmediaries more time to discover overpayments than providers have to\ndiscover underpayments may be justified by the “administrative real-\nities” of the system: a few dozen fiscal intermediaries are charged\n4       SEBELIUS v.

AU-\n\n    BURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 22, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns the time within which health care\nproviders may file an administrative appeal from the\ninitial determination of the reimbursement due them for\ninpatient services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.\nGovernment contractors, called fiscal intermediaries,\nreceive cost reports annually from care providers and\nnotify them of the reimbursement amount for which they\nqualify. A provider dissatisfied with the fiscal intermedi-\nary’s determination may appeal to an administrative body\nnamed the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB\nor Board). The governing statute, §602(h)(l)(D), 97 Stat.\n165, 42 U. S. C. §1395oo(a)(3), sets a 180-day limit for\nfiling appeals from the fiscal intermediary to the PRRB.\nBy a regulation promulgated in 1974, the Secretary of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) author-\nized the Board to extend the 180-day limitation, for good\ncause, up to three years.1\n——————\n 1 The agency was called the Department of Health, Education, and\n\nWelfare until 1979, but for simplicity’s sake we refer to it as HHS\n2     SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   The providers in this case are hospitals who appealed to\nthe PRRB more than ten years after expiration of the 180-\nday statutory deadline. They assert that the Secretary’s\nfailure to disclose information that made the fiscal inter-\nmediary’s reimbursement calculation incorrect prevented\nthem from earlier appealing to the Board. Three positions\nhave been briefed and argued regarding the time for pro-\nviders’ appeals to the PRRB. First, a Court-appointed\namicus curiae has urged that the 180-day limitation is\n“jurisdictional,” and therefore cannot be enlarged at all by\nagency or court. Second, the Government maintains that\nthe Secretary has the prerogative to set an outer limit of\nthree years for appeals to the Board. And third, the hos-\npitals argue that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies,\nstopping the 180-day clock during the time the Secretary\nconcealed the information that made the fiscal interme-\ndiary’s reimbursement determinations incorrect.\n   We hold that the statutory 180-day limitation is not\n“jurisdictional,” and that the Secretary reasonably con-\nstrued the statute to permit a regulation extending the\ntime for a provider’s appeal to the PRRB to three years.\nWe further hold that the presumption in favor of equitable\ntolling does not apply to administrative appeals of the\nkind here at issue.\n                             I\n  The Medicare program covers certain inpatient services\nthat hospitals provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Provid-\ners are reimbursed at a fixed amount per patient, regard-\nless of the actual operating costs they incur in rendering\nthese services. But the total reimbursement amount is\nadjusted upward for hospitals that serve a disproportion-\nate share of low-income patients. This adjustment is\nmade because hospitals with an unusually high percent-\n——————\nthroughout this opinion.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nage of low-income patients generally have higher per-\npatient costs; such hospitals, Congress therefore found,\nshould receive higher reimbursement rates. See H. R.\nRep. No. 99–241, pt. 1, p. 16 (1985). The amount of the\ndisproportionate share adjustment is determined in part\nby the percentage of the patients served by the hospital\nwho are eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI)\npayments, a percentage commonly called the SSI fraction.\n42 U. S. C. §1395ww(d) (2006 ed. and Supp. V).\n  At the end of each year, providers participating in Medi-\ncare submit cost reports to contractors acting on behalf of\nHHS known as fiscal intermediaries. Also at year end,\nthe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) cal-\nculates the SSI fraction for each eligible hospital and\nsubmits that number to the intermediary for that hospital.\nUsing these numbers to determine the total payment due,\nthe intermediary issues a Notice of Program Reimburse-\nment (NPR) informing the provider how much it will be\npaid for the year.\n  If a provider is dissatisfied with the intermediary’s re-\nimbursement determination, the statute gives it the right\nto file a request for a hearing before the PRRB within\n180 days of receiving the NPR. §1395oo(a)(3) (2006 ed.)\nIn 1974, the Secretary promulgated a regulation, after\nnotice and comment rulemaking, permitting the Board to\nextend the 180-day time limit upon a showing of good\ncause; the regulation further provides that “no such exten-\nsion shall be granted by the Board if such request is filed\nmore than 3 years after the date the notice of the interme-\ndiary’s determination is mailed to the provider.” 39 Fed.\nReg. 34517 (1974) (codified in 42 CFR §405.1841(b)\n(2007)).2\n——————\n  2 In 2008, after this case commenced, the Secretary replaced the 1974\n\nregulation with a new prescription limiting “good cause” to “extraordi-\nnary circumstances beyond [the provider’s] control (such as a natural or\n4     SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   For many years, CMS released only the results of its\nSSI fraction calculations and not the underlying data.3\nThe Baystate Medical Center—a hospital not party to this\ncase—timely appealed the calculation of its SSI fraction\nfor each year from 1993 through 1996. Eventually, the\nPRRB determined that CMS had omitted several catego-\nries of SSI data from its calculations and was using a\nflawed process to determine the number of low-income\nbeneficiaries treated by hospitals. These errors caused a\nsystematic undercalculation of the disproportionate share\nadjustment, resulting in underpayments to the providers.\nBaystate Medical Center v. Leavitt, 545 F. Supp. 2d 20,\n26–30 (DC 2008); see id., at 57–58 (concluding that CMS\nfailed to use “the best available data”).\n   The methodological errors revealed by the Board’s Bay-\nstate decision would have yielded similarly reduced pay-\nments to all providers for which CMS had calculated\nan SSI fraction. In March 2006, the Board’s decision in\nthe Baystate case was made public. Within 180 days, the\nhospitals in this case filed a complaint with the Board\nseeking to challenge their disproportionate share adjust-\nments for the years 1987 through 1994. The hospitals\nacknowledged that their challenges, unlike Baystate’s\ntimely contest, were more than a decade out of time. But\nequitable tolling of the limitations period was in order,\nthey urged, due to CMS’s failure to inform the hospitals\n——————\nother catastrophe, fire, or strike).” 73 Fed. Reg. 30250 (2008) (codified\nin 42 CFR §405.1836(b) (2012)). The new regulation retains the strict\nthree-year cutoff for all claims. §405.1836(c)(2). The parties agree that\nthis case is governed by the 1974 regulation, and our opinion today\naddresses only that regulation.\n  3 In §951 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Mod-\n\nernization Act of 2003, 117 Stat. 2427, Congress required the Secretary\nto furnish hospitals with the data necessary to compute their own\ndisproportionate share adjustment. Pursuant to this congressional\nmandate, the Secretary has adopted procedures for turning over the\nSSI data to hospitals upon request. 70 Fed. Reg. 47438 (2005).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat their SSI fractions had been based on faulty data.\n   The PRRB held that it lacked jurisdiction over the\nhospitals’ complaint, reasoning that it had no equitable\npowers save those legislation or regulation might confer,\nand that the Secretary’s regulation permitted it to excuse\nlate appeals only for good cause, with three years as the\nouter limit. On judicial review, the District Court dis-\nmissed the hospitals’ claims for relief, holding that noth-\ning in the statute suggests that “Congress intended to\nauthorize equitable tolling.” 686 F. Supp. 2d 55, 70 (DC\n2010).\n   The Court of Appeals reversed. 642 F. 3d 1145 (CADC\n2011). It relied on the presumption that statutory limita-\ntions periods are generally subject to equitable tolling and\nreasoned that “ ‘the same rebuttable presumption of equi-\ntable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants\nshould also apply to suits against the United States.’ ” Id.,\nat 1148 (quoting Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,\n498 U. S. 89, 95–96 (1990)). The presumption applies\nto the 180-day time limit for provider appeals from re-\nimbursement determinations, the Court of Appeals held,\nfinding nothing in the statutory provision for PRRB re-\nview indicating that Congress intended to disallow equi-\ntable tolling. 642 F. 3d, at 1149–1151.\n   We granted the Secretary’s petition for certiorari, 567\nU. S. ___ (2012), to resolve a conflict among the Courts of\nAppeals over whether the 180-day time limit in 42 U. S. C.\n§1395oo(a)(3) constricts the Board’s jurisdiction. Compare\n642 F. 3d 1145 (case below); Western Medical Enterprises,\nInc. v. Heckler, 783 F. 2d 1376, 1379–1380 (CA9\n1986) (180-day limit is not jurisdictional and the Secretary\nmay extend it for good cause), with Alacare Home Health\nServs., Inc. v. Sullivan, 891 F. 2d 850, 855–856 (CA11\n1990) (statute of limitations is jurisdictional and the Sec-\nretary lacked authority to promulgate good-cause excep-\ntion); St. Joseph’s Hospital of Kansas City v. Heckler, 786\n6     SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nF. 2d 848, 852–853 (CA8 1986) (same). Beyond the juris-\ndictional inquiry,4 the Secretary asked us to determine\nwhether the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that\nequitable tolling applies to providers’ Medicare reim-\nbursement appeals to the PRRB, notwithstanding the\nSecretary’s regulation barring such appeals after three\nyears.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   Characterizing a rule as jurisdictional renders it unique\nin our adversarial system. Objections to a tribunal’s ju-\nrisdiction can be raised at any time, even by a party that\nonce conceded the tribunal’s subject-matter jurisdiction\nover the controversy. Tardy jurisdictional objections can\ntherefore result in a waste of adjudicatory resources and\ncan disturbingly disarm litigants. See Henderson v.\nShinseki, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5); Arbaugh\nv. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006). With these\nuntoward consequences in mind, “we have tried in recent\ncases to bring some discipline to the use” of the term\n“jurisdiction.” Henderson, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5);\nsee also Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523\nU. S. 83, 90 (1998) (jurisdiction has been a “word of many,\ntoo many, meanings” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   To ward off profligate use of the term “jurisdiction,”\nwe have adopted a “readily administrable bright line” for\ndetermining whether to classify a statutory limitation as\njurisdictional.

We inquire\nwhether Congress has “clearly state[d]” that the rule is\njurisdictional; absent such a clear statement, we have\n——————\n  4 Because no party takes the view that the statutory 180-day time\n\nlimit is jurisdictional, we appointed John F.

Thaler, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6); Hender-\nson, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). This is not to say that\nCongress must incant magic words in order to speak\nclearly. We consider “context, including this Court’s inter-\npretations of similar provisions in many years past,” as\nprobative of whether Congress intended a particular\nprovision to rank as jurisdictional. Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.\nMuchnick, 559 U. S. 154, 168 (2010); see also John R.\nSand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133–\n134 (2008).\n   We reiterate what it would mean were we to type the gov-\nerning statute, 42 U. S. C. §1395oo(a)(3), “jurisdictional.”\nUnder no circumstance could providers engage PRRB re-\nview more than 180 days after notice of the fiscal inter-\nmediary’s final determination. Not only could there be no\nequitable tolling. The Secretary’s regulation providing for\na good-cause extension, see supra, at 3, would fall as well.\n   The language Congress used hardly reveals a design to\npreclude any regulatory extension. Section 1395oo(a)(3)\ninstructs that a provider of services “may obtain a hear-\ning” by the Board regarding its reimbursement amount if\n“such provider files a request for a hearing within 180\ndays after notice of the intermediary’s final determina-\ntion.” This provision “does not speak in jurisdictional\nterms.” Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385,\n394 (1982). Indeed, it is less “jurisdictional” in tone than\nthe provision we held to be nonjurisdictional in Henderson.\nThere, the statute provided that a veteran seeking Veter-\nans Court review of the Department of Veterans Affairs’\ndetermination of disability benefits “shall file a notice of\nappeal . . . within 120 days.” 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n9) (quoting 38 U. S. C. §7266(a) (emphasis added)). Sec-\ntion 1395oo(a)(3), by contrast, contains neither the manda-\ntory word “shall” nor the appellation “notice of appeal,”\n8    SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwords with jurisdictional import in the context of 28\nU. S. C. §2107’s limitations on the time for appeal from a\ndistrict court to a court of appeals. See Bowles v. Russell,\n551 U. S. 205, 214 (2007).\n   Key to our decision, we have repeatedly held that filing\ndeadlines ordinarily are not jurisdictional; indeed, we have\ndescribed them as “quintessential claim-processing rules.”\nHenderson, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6); see also Scar-\nborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 414 (2004) (filing dead-\nline for fee applications under Equal Access to Justice\nAct); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 454 (2004) (filing\ndeadlines for objecting to debtor’s discharge in bank-\nruptcy); Honda v. Clark, 386 U. S. 484, 498 (1967) (filing\ndeadline for claims under the Trading with the Enemy\nAct). This case is scarcely the exceptional one in which a “cen-\ntury’s worth of precedent and practice in American courts”\nrank a time limit as jurisdictional. Bowles, 551 U. S., at\n209, n. 2; cf. Kontrick, 540 U. S., at 454 (a time limitation\nmay be emphatic, yet not jurisdictional).\n                               B\n  Amicus urges that the three requirements in §1395oo(a)\nare specifications that together define the limits of the\nPRRB’s jurisdiction. Subsection (a)(1) specifies the claims\nproviders may bring to the Board, and subsection (a)(2)\nsets forth an amount-in-controversy requirement. These\nare jurisdictional requirements, amicus asserts, so we\nshould read the third specification, subsection (a)(3)’s\n180-day limitation, as also setting a jurisdictional\nrequirement.\n  Last Term, we rejected a similar proximity-based argu-\nment. A requirement we would otherwise classify as\nnonjurisdictional, we held, does not become jurisdictional\nsimply because it is placed in a section of a statute that\nalso contains jurisdictional provisions. Gonzalez, 565\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11); see Weinberger v. Salfi, 422\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 749, 763–764 (1975) (statutory provision at issue\ncontained three requirements for judicial review, only one\nof which was jurisdictional).\n   Amicus also argues that the 180-day time limit for pro-\nvider appeals to the PRRB should be viewed as jurisdic-\ntional because Congress could have expressly made the\nprovision nonjurisdictional, and indeed did so for other\ntime limits in the Medicare Act. Amicus notes particularly\nthat when Medicare beneficiaries request the Secretary\nto reconsider a benefits determination, the statute gives\nthem a time limit of 180 days or “such additional time as\nthe Secretary may allow.” 42 U. S. C. §1395ff(b)(1)(D)(i);\nsee also §1395ff(b)(1)(D)(ii) (permitting Medicare benefi-\nciary to request a hearing by the Secretary within “time\nlimits” the Secretary “shall establish in regulations”). We\nhave recognized, as a general rule, that Congress’s use of\n“certain language in one part of the statute and different\nlanguage in another” can indicate that “different meanings\nwere intended.” Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692,\n711, n. 9 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Ami-\ncus notes this general rule in urging that an express grant\nof authority for the Secretary to extend the time for bene-\nficiary appeals implies the absence of such leeway for\nprovider appeals.\n   But the interpretive guide just identified, like other\ncanons of construction, is “no more than [a] rul[e] of\nthumb” that can tip the scales when a statute could be\nread in multiple ways. Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain,\n503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992). For the reasons earlier stated,\nsee supra, at 6–8, we are persuaded that the time limi-\ntation in §1395oo(a) is most sensibly characterized as a\nnonjurisdictional prescription. The limitation therefore\ndoes not bar the modest extension contained in the Secre-\ntary’s regulation.\n10    SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              III\n  We turn now to the question whether §1395oo(a)(3)’s\n180-day time limit for a provider to appeal to the PRRB is\nsubject to equitable tolling.\n                            A\n  Congress vested in the Secretary large rulemaking\nauthority to administer the Medicare program. The PRRB\nmay adopt rules and procedures only if “not inconsistent”\nwith the Medicare Act or “regulations of the Secretary.”\n42 U. S. C. §1395oo(e). Concerning the 180-day period\nfor an appeal to the Board from an intermediary’s reim-\nbursement determination, the Secretary’s regulation im-\nplementing §1395oo, adopted after notice and comment,\nspeaks in no uncertain terms:\n     “A request for a Board hearing filed after [the 180-day\n     time limit] shall be dismissed by the Board, except\n     that for good cause shown, the time limit may be ex-\n     tended. However, no such extension shall be granted\n     by the Board if such request is filed more than 3 years\n     after the date the notice of the intermediary’s deter-\n     mination is mailed to the provider.” 42 CFR\n     §405.1841(b) (2007).\n  The Secretary allowed only a distinctly limited exten-\nsion of time to appeal to the PRRB, cognizant that “the\nBoard is burdened by an immense caseload,” and that\n“procedural rules requiring timely filings are indispens-\nable devices for keeping the machinery of the reimburse-\nment appeals process running smoothly.” High Country\nHome Health, Inc. v. Thompson, 359 F. 3d 1307, 1310\n(CA10 2004). Imposing equitable tolling to permit appeals\nbarred by the Secretary’s regulation would essentially gut\nthe Secretary’s requirement that an appeal to the Board\n“shall be dismissed” if filed more than 180 days after the\nNPR, unless the provider shows “good cause” and requests\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nan extension no later than three years after the NPR. A\ncourt lacks authority to undermine the regime established\nby the Secretary unless her regulation is “arbitrary, capri-\ncious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.” Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 844 (1984).\n   The Secretary’s regulation, we are satisfied, survives\ninspection under that deferential standard. As HHS has\nexplained, “[i]t is in the interest of providers and the pro-\ngram that, at some point, intermediary determinations\nand the resulting amount of program payment due the\nprovider or the program become no longer open to correc-\ntion.” CMS, Medicare: Provider Reimbursement Manual,\npt. 1, ch. 29, §2930, p. 29–73 (rev. no. 372, 2011); cf. Taylor\nv. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 644 (1992) (“Deadlines\nmay lead to unwelcome results, but they prompt parties\nto act and produce finality.”). The Secretary brought to\nbear practical experience in superintending the huge pro-\ngram generally, and the PRRB in particular, in maintaining\nthree years as the outer limit. A court must uphold the\nSecretary’s judgment as long as it is a permissible con-\nstruction of the statute, even if it differs from how the\ncourt would have interpreted the statute in the absence of\nan agency regulation. National Cable & Telecommunica-\ntions Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 980\n(2005); see also Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843, n. 11.\n                              B\n  Rejecting the Secretary’s position, the Court of Appeals\nrelied principally on this Court’s decision in Irwin, 498\nU. S., at 95–96. Irwin concerned the then 30-day time\nperiod for filing suit against a federal agency under Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–\n16(c) (1988 ed.). We held in Irwin that “the same rebut-\ntable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits\nagainst private defendants should also apply to suits\n12   SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst the United States.” 498 U. S., at 95–96. Irwin\nitself, and equitable-tolling cases we have considered both\npre- and post-Irwin, have generally involved time limits\nfor filing suit in federal court. See, e.g., Holland v. Flor-\nida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010) (one-year limitation for filing\napplication for writ of habeas corpus); Rotella v. Wood, 528\nU. S. 549 (2000) (four-year period for filing civil RICO\nsuit); United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38 (1998) (12-\nyear period to bring suit under Quiet Title Act); Lampf,\nPleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S.\n350 (1991) (one- and three-year periods for commencing\ncivil action under §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934); Honda v. Clark, 386 U. S. 484 (1967) (60-day period\nfor filing suit under Trading with the Enemy Act); Kendall\nv. United States, 107 U. S. 123 (1883) (six-year period for\nfiling suit in Court of Claims). Courts in those cases ren-\ndered in the first instance the decision whether equity\nrequired tolling.\n   This case is of a different order. We have never applied\nthe Irwin presumption to an agency’s internal appeal dead-\nline, here the time a provider has to appeal an inter-\nmediary’s reimbursement determination to the PRRB. Cf.\nUnited States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S. 347, 350 (1997)\n(assuming, arguendo, that Irwin presumption applied to\ntime limit for filing an administrative claim for a tax re-\nfund, but concluding based on statutory text, structure,\nand purpose that there was “good reason to believe that\nCongress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to\napply”).\n   The presumption of equitable tolling was adopted in\npart on the premise that “[s]uch a principle is likely to be\na realistic assessment of legislative intent.” Irwin, 498\nU. S., at 95. But that premise is inapt in the context of\nproviders’ administrative appeals under the Medicare Act.\nThe Act, until 1972, provided no avenue for providers to\nobtain administrative or judicial review. When Congress\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfirst directed the Secretary to establish the PRRB, Con-\ngress simultaneously imposed the 180-day deadline, with\nno statutory exceptions. For nearly 40 years the Secre-\ntary has prohibited the Board from extending that dead-\nline, except as provided by regulation. And until the D. C.\nCircuit’s decision in this case, no court had ever read\nequitable tolling into §1395oo(a)(3) or the Secretary’s\nimplementation of that provision. Congress amended\n§1395oo six times since 1974, each time leaving untouched\nthe 180-day administrative appeal provision and the\nSecretary’s rulemaking authority. At no time did Con-\ngress express disapproval of the three-year outer time\nlimit set by the Secretary for an extension upon a showing\nof good cause. See Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v.\nSchor, 478 U. S. 833, 846 (1986) (“[W]hen Congress revisits\na statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative\ninterpretation without pertinent change, the congressional\nfailure to revise or repeal the agency’s interpretation is\npersuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one in-\ntended by Congress.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   We note, furthermore, that unlike the remedial statutes\nat issue in many of this Court’s equitable-tolling decisions,\nsee Irwin, 498 U. S., at 91; Bowen v. City of New York, 476\nU. S. 467, 480 (1986); Zipes, 455 U. S., at 398, the statu-\ntory scheme before us is not designed to be “ ‘unusually\nprotective’ of claimants.” Bowen, 476 U. S., at 480. Nor is\nit one “in which laymen, unassisted by trained lawyers,\ninitiate the process.” Zipes, 455 U. S., at 397 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Medicare payment system\nin question applies to “sophisticated” institutional pro-\nviders assisted by legal counsel, and “generally capable\nof identifying an underpayment in [their] own NPR\nwithin the 180-day time period specified in 42 U. S. C.\n§1395oo(a)(3).” Your Home Visiting Nurse Services, Inc. v.\nShalala, 525 U. S. 449, 456 (1999). As repeat players who\nelect to participate in the Medicare system, providers can\n14    SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhardly claim lack of notice of the Secretary’s regulations.\n  The hospitals ultimately argue that the Secretary’s\nregulations fail to adhere to the “fundamentals of fair\nplay.” FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S.\n134, 143 (1940). They point, particularly, to 42 CFR\n§405.1885(b)(3) (2012), which permits reopening of an\nintermediary’s reimbursement determination “at any time\nif it is established that such determination . . . was\nprocured by fraud or similar fault of any party to the\ndetermination.”5\n  We considered a similar alleged inequity in Your Home\nand explained that it was justified by the “administrative\nrealities” of the provider reimbursement appeal system.\n525 U. S., at 455. There are only a few dozen fiscal inter-\nmediaries and they are charged with issuing tens of thou-\nsands of NPRs, while each provider can concentrate on\na single NPR, its own. Id., at 456. The Secretary, Your\nHome concluded, could reasonably believe that this asym-\nmetry justifies giving the intermediaries more time to\ndiscover overpayments than the providers have to discover\nunderpayments. Moreover, the fraud exception allowing\nindefinite reopening does apply to an intermediary if it\n“procured” a Board decision by “fraud or similar fault.”\nAlthough an intermediary is not a party to its own deter-\nmination, it does rank as a party in proceedings before the\nBoard. 42 CFR §405.1843(a).6\n\n\n——————\n  5 Because neither the Secretary nor the intermediary counts as a\n\nparty to the intermediary’s determination, 42 CFR §405.1805, providers\nalone are subject to this exception to the time limitation.\n  6 The fraud exception apart, reopening time is limited to three years.\n\n§405.1885(a). Within that time, reopening may be sought by the\nintermediary, the Board, the Secretary, or the provider. Thus an\nintermediary determination or Board decision could not be reopened if,\noutside the three-year window, the Secretary discovered errors in\ncalculating the SSI fraction that resulted in overpayments to providers.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                        *    *     *\n  We hold, in sum, that the 180-day statutory deadline\nfor administrative appeals to the PRRB, contained in 42\nU. S. C. §1395oo(a)(3), is not “jurisdictional.” Therefore\nthe Secretary lawfully exercised her rulemaking authority\nin providing for a three-year “good cause” extension. We\nfurther hold that the equitable tolling presumption our\nIrwin decision approved for suits brought in court does not\nsimilarly apply to administrative appeals of the kind\nhere considered, and that the Secretary’s regulation, 42\nCFR §405.1841(b), is a permissible interpretation of the\nstatute.\n   The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia Circuit is therefore reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

AU-\n\n    BURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                      [January 22, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring.\n   The Court holds that the presumption in favor of equi-\ntable tolling that we adopted in Irwin v. Department of\nVeterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95–96 (1990), does not\napply to 42 U. S. C. §1395oo(a)(3)’s nonjurisdictional 180-\nday deadline for health care providers to file administra-\ntive appeals with the Provider Reimbursement Review\nBoard (PRRB), and that the Secretary’s regulation limit-\ning “good cause” extensions of that deadline to three years\nis a permissible interpretation of the statute. I agree with\nthose holdings and join the Court’s opinion in full. I write\nseparately to note that the Court’s decision in this case\ndoes not establish that equitable tolling principles are\nirrelevant to internal administrative deadlines in all, or\neven most, contexts.\n   The Court is correct that our equitable tolling cases\nhave typically involved deadlines to bring suit in federal\ncourt. Ante, at 12. But we have never suggested that\nthe presumption in favor of equitable tolling is generally\ninapplicable to administrative deadlines. Cf. Henderson v.\nShinseki, 562 U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2011) (slip op., at 12,\nn. 4) (noting that the Government did not dispute whether\nthe statutory filing deadline in the Article I Veterans\nCourt was subject to equitable tolling if the deadline was\n2    SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nnonjurisdictional); United States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S.\n347, 350–353 (1997) (assuming without deciding that the\nIrwin presumption applied to administrative tax refund\nclaims but finding based on statutory text, structure, and\nthe underlying subject matter that tolling was unavail-\nable); see also ante, at 12 (discussing Brockamp). And we\nhave previously applied the Irwin presumption outside the\ncontext of filing deadlines in Article III courts. See Young\nv. United States, 535 U. S. 43, 49–53 (2002) (applying the\npresumption to a limitations period in bankruptcy pro-\nceedings); cf. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S.\n385, 392–398 (1982) (holding that the statutory time limit\nfor filing charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission was “not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit\nin federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of\nlimitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable\ntolling”).\n   In administrative settings other than the one presented\nhere, I believe the “background principle” that limita-\ntions periods “are customarily subject to equitable tolling,”\nYoung, 535 U. S., at 49–50 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), may limit an agency’s discretion to make filing\ndeadlines absolute. The Court quite properly observes\nthat the question whether equitable tolling is available\nturns on congressional intent. See ante, at 13. “[A] realis-\ntic assessment” of that intent, Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95, may\nvary by context.\n   In this case, given the nature of the statutory scheme,\nwhich “applies to ‘sophisticated’ institutional providers”\nwho are “repeat players” in the Medicare system, and the\nstatute’s history, I agree that it would distort congres-\nsional intent to presume that the PRRB’s administrative\ndeadline should be subject to equitable tolling. Ante, at\n12–14 (quoting Your Home Visiting Nurse Services, Inc. v.\nShalala, 525 U. S. 449, 456 (1999)). By contrast, with\nrespect to remedial statutes designed to protect the rights\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nof unsophisticated claimants, see ante, at 13, agencies\n(and reviewing courts) may best honor congressional\nintent by presuming that statutory deadlines for admin-\nistrative appeals are subject to equitable tolling, just as\ncourts presume comparable judicial deadlines under such\nstatutes may be tolled. Because claimants must generally\npursue administrative relief before seeking judicial re-\nview, see Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. 81, 88–91 (2006), a\ncontrary approach could have odd practical consequences\nand would attribute a strange intent to Congress: to pro-\ntect a claimant’s ability to seek judicial review of an agen-\ncy’s decision by making equitable tolling available, while\nleaving to the agency’s discretion whether the same claim-\nant may invoke equitable tolling in order to seek an ad-\nministrative remedy in the first place.\n   Even in cases where the governing statute clearly dele-\ngates to an agency the discretion to adopt rules that limit\nthe scope of equitable exceptions to administrative dead-\nlines, I believe “cases may arise where the equities in\nfavor of tolling the limitations period are ‘so great that\ndeference to the agency’s judgment is inappropriate.’ ”\nBowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S. 467, 480 (1986)\n(quoting Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 330 (1976)).\nIn particular, efforts by an agency to enforce tight filing\ndeadlines in cases where there are credible allegations\nthat filing delay was due to the agency’s own misfea-\nsance may not survive deferential review. While equitable\ntolling extends to circumstances outside both parties’\ncontrol, the related doctrines of equitable estoppel and\nfraudulent concealment may bar a defendant from enforc-\ning a statute of limitation when its own deception pre-\nvented a reasonably diligent plaintiff from bringing a\ntimely claim. See United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38,\n49–50 (1998) (Stevens, J., concurring) (noting that these\ndoctrines are distinct); see generally 2 C. Corman, Limita-\ntion of Actions §§9.1, 9.7 (1991) (describing the doctrines).\n4    SEBELIUS v. AUBURN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nIn Bowen, we applied the basic principle underlying these\ndoctrines to an agency’s conduct, as we concluded that a\n60-day deadline to seek judicial review of the administra-\ntive denial of disability benefits should be tolled because\nthe Social Security Administration’s “‘secretive conduct pre-\nvent[ed] plaintiffs from knowing of a violation of rights.’ ”\n476 U. S., at 481 (quoting New York v. Heckler, 742 F. 2d\n729, 738 (CA2 1984)).\n   While the providers in this case allege that the agency’s\nfailure to disclose information about how it calculated the\nSupplemental Security Income fraction prevented them\nfrom bringing timely challenges to reimbursement de-\nterminations, I am satisfied that the Secretary’s 3-year\ngood-cause exception is a reasonable accommodation of the\ncompeting interests in administrative efficiency and fair-\nness. We would face a different case if the Secretary’s\nregulation did not recognize an exception for good cause or\ndefined good cause so narrowly as to exclude cases of\nfraudulent concealment and equitable estoppel. See ante,\nat 3, n. 2 (explaining that the Secretary’s amended regula-\ntion limiting the scope of “ ‘good cause,’ ” 73 Fed. Reg.\n30250 (2008) (codified in 42 CFR §405.1836(b) (2012)), is\nnot before us).\n   With these observations, I join the Court’s opinion in\nfull.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/815689/", "sha1": "8ca360a85c8bdc8032590e106b6da1f7eecc374d", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2013-01-22T07:10:15"}
