Argued November 1, 2012—Decided February 20, 2013\nImmigration officials initiated removal proceedings against petitioner\n  Chaidez in 2009 upon learning that she had pleaded guilty to mail\n  fraud in 2004. To avoid removal, she sought to overturn that convic-\n  tion by filing a petition for a writ of coram nobis, contending that her\n  former attorney’s failure to advise her of the guilty plea’s immigra-\n  tion consequences constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under\n  the Sixth Amendment. While her petition was pending, this Court\n  held in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, that the Sixth Amendment\n  requires defense attorneys to inform non-citizen clients of the depor-\n  tation risks of guilty pleas. The District Court vacated Chaidez’s\n  conviction, determining that Padilla did not announce a “new rule”\n  under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, and thus applied to Chaidez’s\n  case. The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Padilla had de-\n  clared a new rule and should not apply in a challenge to a final con-\n  viction.\nHeld: Padilla does not apply retroactively to cases already final on di-\n rect review. Pp. 3−15.\n    (a) Under Teague, a person whose conviction is already final may\n not benefit from a new rule of criminal procedure on collateral re-\n view. A “case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by\n precedent existing at the time the defendant’s conviction became fi-\n nal.” Teague, 489 U. S., at 301. And a holding is not so dictated un-\n less it would have been “apparent to all reasonable jurists.” Lambrix\n v. Singletary, 520 U. S. 518, 527−528. At the same time, a case does\n not “announce a new rule, [when] it [is] merely an application of the\n principle that governed” a prior decision to a different set of facts.\n Teague, 489 U. S., at 307. Thus, garden-variety applications of the\n test in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, for assessing ineffec-\n2                     CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tive assistance claims do not produce new rules, id., at 687−688.\n       But Padilla did more than just apply Strickland’s general standard\n    to yet another factual situation. Before deciding if failing to inform a\n    client about the risk of deportation “fell below [Strickland’s] objective\n    standard of reasonableness,” 466 U. S., at 688, Padilla first consid-\n    ered the threshold question whether advice about deportation was\n    “categorically removed” from the scope of the Sixth Amendment right\n    to counsel because it involved only a “collateral consequence” of a\n    conviction, rather than a component of a criminal sentence, 559 U. S.,\n    at ___. That is, prior to asking how the Strickland test applied, Pa-\n    dilla asked whether that test applied at all.\n       That preliminary question came to the Court unsettled. Hill v.\n    Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, had explicitly left open whether the Sixth\n    Amendment right extends to collateral consequences. That left the\n    issue to the state and lower federal courts, and they almost unani-\n    mously concluded that the Sixth Amendment does not require attor-\n    neys to inform their clients of a conviction’s collateral consequences,\n    including deportation. Padilla’s contrary ruling thus answered an\n    open question about the Sixth Amendment’s reach, in a way that al-\n    tered the law of most jurisdictions. In so doing, Padilla broke new\n    ground and imposed a new obligation. Pp. 3−11.\n       (b) Chaidez argues that Padilla did no more than apply Strickland\n    to a new set of facts. But she ignores that Padilla had to develop new\n    law to determine that Strickland applied at all. The few lower court\n    decisions she cites held only that a lawyer may not affirmatively mis-\n    represent his expertise or otherwise actively mislead his client as to\n    any important matter. Those rulings do not apply to her case, and\n    they do not show that all reasonable judges thought that lawyers had\n    to advise their clients about deportation risks. Neither does INS v.\n    St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, have any relevance here. In saying that a rea-\n    sonably competent lawyer would tell a non-citizen client about a\n    guilty plea’s deportation consequences, St. Cyr did not determine that\n    the Sixth Amendment requires a lawyer to provide such information.\n    It took Padilla to decide that question.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [February 20, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___ (2010), this Court\nheld that the Sixth Amendment requires an attorney for\na criminal defendant to provide advice about the risk of\ndeportation arising from a guilty plea. We consider here\nwhether that ruling applies retroactively, so that a person\nwhose conviction became final before we decided Padilla\ncan benefit from it. We conclude that, under the prin­\nciples set out in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989),\nPadilla does not have retroactive effect.\n                            I\n  Petitioner Roselva Chaidez hails from Mexico, but be­\ncame a lawful permanent resident of the United States\nin 1977. About 20 years later, she helped to defraud an\nautomobile insurance company out of $26,000. After\nfederal agents uncovered the scheme, Chaidez pleaded\nguilty to two counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18\nU. S. C. §1341. The District Court sentenced her to four\nyears of probation and ordered her to pay restitution.\nChaidez’s conviction became final in 2004.\n  Under federal immigration law, the offenses to which\nChaidez pleaded guilty are “aggravated felonies,” subject­\n2                   CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ning her to mandatory removal from this country. See 8\nU. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(M)(i), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). But accord­\ning to Chaidez, her attorney never advised her of that fact,\nand at the time of her plea she remained ignorant of it.\n   Immigration officials initiated removal proceedings\nagainst Chaidez in 2009, after an application she made for\ncitizenship alerted them to her prior conviction. To avoid\nremoval, Chaidez sought to overturn that conviction by\nfiling a petition for a writ of coram nobis in Federal Dis­\ntrict Court.1 She argued that her former attorney’s failure\nto advise her of the immigration consequences of pleading\nguilty constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under\nthe Sixth Amendment.\n   While Chaidez’s petition was pending, this Court decided\nPadilla. Our ruling vindicated Chaidez’s view of the\nSixth Amendment: We held that criminal defense attor­\nneys must inform non-citizen clients of the risks of depor­\ntation arising from guilty pleas. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9). But the Government argued that Chaidez could\nnot benefit from Padilla because it announced a “new\nrule” and, under Teague, such rules do not apply in collat­\neral challenges to already-final convictions.\n   The District Court determined that Padilla “did not\nannounce a new rule for Teague purposes,” and therefore\nshould apply to Chaidez’s case. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2477642\"><a href=\"/ilnd/dGvY/united-states-v-chaidez/\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 904\n(ND Ill. 2010). It then found that Chaidez’s counsel had\nperformed deficiently under Padilla and that Chaidez\nsuffered prejudice as a result. Accordingly, the court\nvacated Chaidez’s conviction. See No. 03 CR 636–6, 2010\n——————\n  1 A petition for a writ of coram nobis provides a way to collaterally\n\nattack a criminal conviction for a person, like Chaidez, who is no longer\n“in custody” and therefore cannot seek habeas relief under 28 U. S. C.\n§2255 or §2241. See United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502, 507, 510–\n511 (1954). Chaidez and the Government agree that nothing in this\ncase turns on the difference between a coram nobis petition and a\nhabeas petition, and we assume without deciding that they are correct.\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

And state and lower\nfederal courts had uniformly concluded that an attorney\nneed not give “advice concerning [such a] collateral (as\nopposed to direct) consequenc[e] of a guilty plea.” Id., at\n690. According to the Seventh Circuit, Padilla’s holding\nwas new because it ran counter to that widely accepted\n“distinction between direct and collateral consequences.”\n655 F. 3d, at 691. Judge Williams dissented. Agreeing\nwith the Third Circuit’s view, she argued that Padilla\n“broke no new ground” because it merely applied estab­\nlished law about a lawyer’s “duty to consult” with a client.\n655 F. 3d, at 695 (quoting United States v. Orocio, 645\nF. 3d 630, 638–639 (CA3 2011) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   We granted certiorari, 566 U. S. ___ (2012), to resolve a\nsplit among federal and state courts on whether Padilla\napplies retroactively.2 Holding that it does not, we affirm\nthe Seventh Circuit.\n                         II\n  Teague makes the retroactivity of our criminal proce­\n——————\n  2 Compare 655 F. 3d 684 (CA7 2011) (case below) (not retroactive);\n\nUnited States v.

When we\nannounce a “new rule,” a person whose conviction is al­\nready final may not benefit from the decision in a habeas\nor similar proceeding.3 Only when we apply a settled rule\nmay a person avail herself of the decision on collateral\nreview. Here, Chaidez filed her coram nobis petition five\nyears after her guilty plea became final. Her challenge\ntherefore fails if Padilla declared a new rule.\n  “[A] case announces a new rule,” Teague explained,\n“when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation”\non the government. 489 U. S., at 301. “To put it differ­\nently,” we continued, “a case announces a new rule if the\nresult was not dictated by precedent existing at the time\nthe defendant’s conviction became final.” Ibid. And a\nholding is not so dictated, we later stated, unless it would\nhave been “apparent to all reasonable jurists.” Lambrix v.\nSingletary, 520 U. S. 518, 527–528 (1997).\n  But that account has a flipside. Teague also made clear\nthat a case does not “announce a new rule, [when] it ‘[is]\nmerely an application of the principle that governed’ ” a\nprior decision to a different set of facts. 489 U. S., at 307\n(quoting Yates v. Aiken, 484 U. S. 211, 217 (1988)). As\nJUSTICE KENNEDY has explained, “[w]here the beginning\npoint” of our analysis is a rule of “general application, a\nrule designed for the specific purpose of evaluating a\nmyriad of factual contexts, it will be the infrequent case\nthat yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule, one\nnot dictated by precedent.” Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277,\n309 (1992) (concurring in judgment); see also Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 362, 391 (2000). Otherwise said, when\nall we do is apply a general standard to the kind of factual\n——————\n   3 Teague stated two exceptions: “[W]atershed rules of criminal proce­\n\ndure” and rules placing “conduct beyond the power of the [government]\nto proscribe” apply on collateral review, even if novel. 489 U. S., at 311\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Chaidez does not argue that either\nof those exceptions is relevant here.\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncircumstances it was meant to address, we will rarely\nstate a new rule for Teague purposes.\n   Because that is so, garden-variety applications of the\ntest in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), for\nassessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel do\nnot produce new rules. In Strickland, we held that legal\nrepresentation violates the Sixth Amendment if it falls\n“below an objective standard of reasonableness,” as indi­\ncated by “prevailing professional norms,” and the defend­\nant suffers prejudice as a result. Id., at 687–688. That\nstandard, we later concluded, “provides sufficient guidance\nfor resolving virtually all” claims of ineffective assistance,\neven though their particular circumstances will differ.\nWilliams, 529 U. S., at 391. And so we have granted relief\nunder Strickland in diverse contexts without ever suggest­\ning that doing so required a new rule. See, e.g., ibid.;\nRompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith,\n539 U. S. 510 (2003).4 In like manner, Padilla would not\nhave created a new rule had it only applied Strickland’s\ngeneral standard to yet another factual situation—that is,\nhad Padilla merely made clear that a lawyer who neglects\nto inform a client about the risk of deportation is profes­\nsionally incompetent.\n   But Padilla did something more. Before deciding if\nfailing to provide such advice “fell below an objective stan­\ndard of reasonableness,” Padilla considered a threshold\nquestion: Was advice about deportation “categorically\nremoved” from the scope of the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel because it involved only a “collateral consequence”\nof a conviction, rather than a component of the criminal\n\n——————\n  4 We did not consider Teague in Williams, Rompilla, and Wiggins, but\n\nwe granted habeas relief pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) because\nstate courts had unreasonably applied “clearly established” law. And,\nas we have explained, “clearly established” law is not “new” within the\nmeaning of Teague. See Williams, 529 U. S., at 412.\n6                    CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsentence? 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7–9).5 In other\nwords, prior to asking how the Strickland test applied\n(“Did this attorney act unreasonably?”), Padilla asked\nwhether the Strickland test applied (“Should we even\nevaluate if this attorney acted unreasonably?”). And as we\nwill describe, that preliminary question about Strickland’s\nambit came to the Padilla Court unsettled—so that the\nCourt’s answer (“Yes, Strickland governs here”) required a\nnew rule.\n  The relevant background begins with our decision in\nHill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), which explicitly left\nopen whether advice concerning a collateral consequence\nmust satisfy Sixth Amendment requirements. Hill pleaded\nguilty to first-degree murder after his attorney misin­\nformed him about his parole eligibility. In addressing his\nclaim of ineffective assistance, we first held that the\nStrickland standard extends generally to the plea process.\nSee Hill, 474 U. S., at 57. We then determined, however,\nthat Hill had failed to allege prejudice from the lawyer’s\nerror and so could not prevail under that standard. See\nid., at 60. That conclusion allowed us to avoid another,\nmore categorical question: whether advice about parole\n(however inadequate and prejudicial) could possibly vio­\nlate the Sixth Amendment. The Court of Appeals, we\nnoted, had held “that parole eligibility is a collateral ra­\nther than a direct consequence of a guilty plea, of which a\ndefendant need not be informed.” Id., at 55. But our\nruling on prejudice made “it unnecessary to determine\nwhether there may be circumstances under which” ad-\n——————\n   5 We have never attempted to delineate the world of “collateral conse­\n\nquences,” see Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___, n. 8 (slip op., at 7, n. 8), nor do\nwe do so here. But other effects of a conviction commonly viewed as\ncollateral include civil commitment, civil forfeiture, sex offender regis­\ntration, disqualification from public benefits, and disfranchisement.\nSee id., at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2–3)\n(listing other examples).\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nvice about a matter deemed collateral violates the Sixth\nAmendment. Id., at 60.6\n   That non-decision left the state and lower federal courts\nto deal with the issue; and they almost unanimously con­\ncluded that the Sixth Amendment does not require attor­\nneys to inform their clients of a conviction’s collateral\nconsequences, including deportation. All 10 federal appel­\nlate courts to consider the question decided, in the words\nof one, that “counsel’s failure to inform a defendant of the\ncollateral consequences of a guilty plea is never” a viola­\ntion of the Sixth Amendment. Santos-Sanchez v. United\nStates, 548 F. 3d 327, 334 (CA5 2008).7 That constitutional\nguarantee, another typical decision expounded, “assures\nan accused of effective assistance of counsel in ‘criminal\nprosecutions’ ”; accordingly, advice about matters like de-\nportation, which are “not a part of or enmeshed in the\ncriminal proceeding,” does not fall within the Amend­\nment’s scope. United States v. George, 869 F. 2d 333, 337\n(CA7 1989). Appellate courts in almost 30 States agreed.8\n——————\n   6 In saying that much, we declined to rule not only on whether advice\n\nabout a conviction’s collateral consequences falls outside the Sixth\nAmendment’s scope, but also on whether parole eligibility should be\nconsidered such a consequence, as the court of appeals held.\n   7 See Broomes v.

Post, at 10\n(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). We instead point to the presence of lower\ncourt authority—in case after case and jurisdiction after jurisdiction—\nholding that such a failure, because relating to a collateral matter,\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)        9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   So when we decided Padilla, we answered a question\nabout the Sixth Amendment’s reach that we had left open,\nin a way that altered the law of most jurisdictions—and\nour reasoning reflected that we were doing as much. In\nthe normal Strickland case, a court begins by evaluating\nthe reasonableness of an attorney’s conduct in light of\nprofessional norms, and then assesses prejudice. But as\nearlier indicated, see supra, at 5–6, Padilla had a different\nstarting point. Before asking whether the performance\nof Padilla’s attorney was deficient under Strickland, we\nconsidered (in a separately numbered part of the opinion)\nwhether Strickland applied at all. See 559 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 7–9). Many courts, we acknowledged, had\nexcluded advice about collateral matters from the Sixth\nAmendment’s ambit; and deportation, because the conse­\nquence of a distinct civil proceeding, could well be viewed\nas such a matter. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But, we\ncontinued, no decision of our own committed us to “appl[y]\na distinction between direct and collateral consequences to\ndefine the scope” of the right to counsel. Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 8). And however apt that distinction might be in\nother contexts, it should not exempt from Sixth Amend­\nment scrutiny a lawyer’s advice (or non-advice) about\na plea’s deportation risk. Deportation, we stated, is\n“unique.” Ibid. It is a “particularly severe” penalty, and\none “intimately related to the criminal process”; indeed,\nimmigration statutes make it “nearly an automatic result”\nof some convictions. Ibid. We thus resolved the threshold\nquestion before us by breaching the previously chink-free\nwall between direct and collateral consequences: Notwith­\nstanding the then-dominant view, “Strickland applies to\nPadilla’s claim.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n   If that does not count as “break[ing] new ground” or\n“impos[ing] a new obligation,” we are hard pressed to\n\n—————— \n\ncould not do so. \n\n10                  CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nknow what would. Teague, 489 U. S., at 301. Before\nPadilla, we had declined to decide whether the Sixth\nAmendment had any relevance to a lawyer’s advice about\nmatters not part of a criminal proceeding. Perhaps some\nadvice of that kind would have to meet Strickland’s rea­\nsonableness standard—but then again, perhaps not: No\nprecedent of our own “dictated” the answer. Teague, 489\nU. S., at 301. And as the lower courts filled the vacuum,\nthey almost uniformly insisted on what Padilla called the\n“categorica[l] remov[al]” of advice about a conviction’s non­\ncriminal consequences—including deportation—from the\nSixth Amendment’s scope. 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\nIt was Padilla that first rejected that categorical ap­\nproach—and so made the Strickland test operative—when\na criminal lawyer gives (or fails to give) advice about\nimmigration consequences.11 In acknowledging that fact,\nwe do not cast doubt on, or at all denigrate, Padilla.\nCourts often need to, and do, break new ground; it is the\nvery premise of Teague that a decision can be right and\nalso be novel. All we say here is that Padilla’s holding\nthat the failure to advise about a non-criminal conse­\n——————\n   11 The separate opinions in Padilla objected to just this aspect of the\n\nCourt’s ruling. Dissents have been known to exaggerate the novelty\nof majority opinions; and “the mere existence of a dissent,” like the\nexistence of conflicting authority in state or lower federal courts, does\nnot establish that a rule is new. Beard v. Banks, 542 U. S. 406, 416,\nn. 5 (2004); see Williams, 529 U. S., at 410. But the concurring and\ndissenting opinions in Padilla were on to something when they de­\nscribed the line the Court was crossing. “Until today,” JUSTICE ALITO\nwrote, “the longstanding and unanimous position of the federal courts\nwas that reasonable defense counsel generally need only advise a client\nabout the direct consequences of a criminal conviction.” See 559 U. S.,\nat ___ (concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2). Or again, this time from\nJUSTICE SCALIA: “[U]ntil today,” the Sixth Amendment guaranteed only\n“legal advice directly related to defense against prosecution” of a\ncriminal charge. Id., at ___ (dissenting) (slip op., at 2). One need not\nagree with any of the separate opinions’ criticisms of Padilla to concur\nwith their view that it modified governing law.\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                 11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nquence could violate the Sixth Amendment would not have\nbeen—in fact, was not—“apparent to all reasonable ju­\nrists” prior to our decision. Lambrix, 520 U. S., at 527–\n528. Padilla thus announced a “new rule.”\n                             III\n   Chaidez offers, and the dissent largely adopts, a differ­\nent account of Padilla, in which we did no more than\napply Strickland to a new set of facts. On Chaidez’s view,\nStrickland insisted “[f]rom its inception” that all aspects of\na criminal lawyer’s performance pass a test of “ ‘reasona­\nbleness under prevailing professional norms’ ”: The deci­\nsion thus foreclosed any “categorical distinction between\ndirect and collateral consequences.” Brief for Petitioner\n21–22 (emphasis deleted) (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S.,\nat 688). Indeed, Chaidez contends, courts prior to Padilla\nrecognized Strickland’s all-encompassing scope and so\napplied its reasonableness standard to advice concerning\ndeportation. See Brief for Petitioner 25–26; Reply Brief\n10–12. She here points to caselaw in three federal appeals\ncourts allowing ineffective assistance claims when attor­\nneys affirmatively misled their clients about the deporta­\ntion consequences of guilty pleas.12 The only question left\nfor Padilla to resolve, Chaidez claims, was whether pro­\nfessional norms also require criminal lawyers to volunteer\nadvice about the risk of deportation. In addressing that\nissue, she continues, Padilla did a run-of-the-mill Strick-\nland analysis. And more: It did an especially easy Strick-\nland analysis. We had earlier noted in INS v. St. Cyr, 533\nU. S. 289 (2001)—a case raising an issue of immigration\nlaw unrelated to the Sixth Amendment—that a “compe­\ntent defense counsel” would inform his client about a\nguilty plea’s deportation consequences. Id., at 323, n. 50.\n——————\n   12 See United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d 1005, 1015–1017 (CA9 2005);\n\nUnited States v. Couto, 311 F. 3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); Downs-Morgan\nv. United States, 765 F. 2d 1534, 1540–1541 (CA11 1985).\n12                  CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAll Padilla had to do, Chaidez concludes, was recite that\nprior finding.\n   But Chaidez’s (and the dissent’s) story line is wrong, for\nreasons we have mostly already noted: Padilla had to\ndevelop new law, establishing that the Sixth Amendment\napplied at all, before it could assess the performance of\nPadilla’s lawyer under Strickland. See supra, at 5–6, 9.\nOur first order of business was thus to consider whether\nthe widely accepted distinction between direct and collat­\neral consequences categorically foreclosed Padilla’s claim,\nwhatever the level of his attorney’s performance. We did\nnot think, as Chaidez argues, that Strickland barred\nresort to that distinction. Far from it: Even in Padilla we\ndid not eschew the direct-collateral divide across the\nboard. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (“Whether that\ndistinction is [generally] appropriate is a question we need\nnot consider in this case”). Rather, we relied on the spe­\ncial “nature of deportation”—the severity of the penalty\nand the “automatic” way it follows from conviction—to\nshow that “[t]he collateral versus direct distinction [was]\nill-suited” to dispose of Padilla’s claim. Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 8–9). All that reasoning came before we conducted a\nStrickland analysis (by examining professional norms and\nso forth), and none of it followed ineluctably from prior\nlaw.13\n——————\n   13 The dissent’s entire analysis founders on this most basic point. In\n\nits lengthy description of Padilla, the dissent picks up in the middle—\nafter the Court concluded that the direct-collateral distinction did not\npreclude finding that Padilla’s lawyer provided ineffective assistance\nunder the Sixth Amendment. See post, at 3–5. The dissent justifies\nignoring that threshold conclusion on the ground that “Padilla declined\nto embrace the . . . distinction between collateral and direct conse­\nquences” and “stated very clearly that it found the distinction irrele­\nvant” to the case. Post, at 6. But it is exactly in refusing to apply the\ndirect-collateral distinction that the Padilla Court did something novel.\nBefore then, as the Court forthrightly acknowledged, that distinction\nwould have doomed Padilla’s claim in well-nigh every court in the\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Predictably, then, the caselaw Chaidez and the dissent\ncite fails to support their claim that lower courts “accepted\nthat Strickland applied to deportation advice.” Brief for\nPetitioner 25; see post, at 8–11. True enough, three fed-\neral circuits (and a handful of state courts) held before Pa-\ndilla that misstatements about deportation could support\nan ineffective assistance claim. But those decisions rea­\nsoned only that a lawyer may not affirmatively misrepre­\nsent his expertise or otherwise actively mislead his client\non any important matter, however related to a criminal\nprosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d\n1005, 1015–1017 (CA9 2005). They co-existed happily\nwith precedent, from the same jurisdictions (and almost\nall others), holding that deportation is not “so unique as to\nwarrant an exception to the general rule that a defendant\nneed not be advised of the [collateral] consequences of a\nguilty plea.” United States v. Campbell, 778 F. 2d 764,\n769 (CA11 1985).14 So at most, Chaidez has shown that a\nminority of courts recognized a separate rule for material\nmisrepresentations, regardless whether they concerned\ndeportation or another collateral matter. That limited\nrule does not apply to Chaidez’s case. And because it lived\nin harmony with the exclusion of claims like hers from the\nSixth Amendment, it does not establish what she needs\nto—that all reasonable judges, prior to Padilla, thought\nthey were living in a Padilla-like world.\n   Nor, finally, does St. Cyr have any relevance here. That\n\n——————\nUnited States. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7); supra, at 9.\n   14 See also Resendiz v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision stated what is common sense (and what we again\nrecognized in Padilla): A reasonably competent lawyer will\ntell a non-citizen client about a guilty plea’s deportation\nconsequences because “ ‘[p]reserving the client’s right to\nremain in the United States may be more important to the\nclient than any potential jail sentence.’ ” Padilla, 559\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at\n322). But in saying that much, St. Cyr did not determine\nthat the Sixth Amendment requires a lawyer to provide\nsuch information. Courts had held to the contrary not\nbecause advice about deportation was insignificant to a\nclient—really, who could think that, whether before or\nafter St. Cyr?—but because it concerned a matter collat­\neral to the criminal prosecution.15 On those courts’ view,\nthe Sixth Amendment no more demanded competent\nadvice about a plea’s deportation consequences than it\ndemanded competent representation in the deportation\nprocess itself. Padilla decided that view was wrong. But\nto repeat: It was Padilla that did so. In the years follow­\ning St. Cyr, not a single state or lower federal court con­\nsidering a lawyer’s failure to provide deportation advice\n——————\n   15 The dissent claims the opposite, averring that lower court “deci­\n\nsions show nothing more than that the underlying professional norms\nhad not yet evolved to require attorneys to provide advice about depor­\ntation consequences.” Post, at 8. But the dissent cannot point to a\nsingle decision stating that a lawyer’s failure to offer advice about\ndeportation met professional norms; all the decisions instead held that\na lawyer’s breach of those norms was constitutionally irrelevant be­\ncause deportation was a collateral consequence. See supra, at 7. Had\ncourts in fact considered professional standards in the slew of cases\nbefore Padilla that presented Padilla-like claims, they would have\ndiscovered as early as 1968 that the American Bar Association in­\nstructed criminal lawyers to advise their non-citizen clients about the\nrisks of deportation. See 3 ABA Project on Standards for Criminal\nJustice, Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty §3.2(b), Commentary,\np. 71 (App. Draft 1968). The difficulty in upholding such claims prior to\nPadilla had nothing to do with courts’ view of professional norms and\neverything to do with their use of the direct-collateral divide.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nabandoned the distinction between direct and collateral\nconsequences, and several courts reaffirmed that divide.\nSee, e.g., Santos-Sanchez, 548 F. 3d, at 335–336; Broomes\nv. Ashcroft, 358 F. 3d 1251, 1256–1257 (CA10 2004);\nUnited States v. Fry, 322 F. 3d 1198, 1200–1201 (CA9 2003).\nIt took Padilla to decide that in assessing such a lawyer’s\nperformance, the Sixth Amendment sets the standard.16\n                           IV\n  This Court announced a new rule in Padilla. Under\nTeague, defendants whose convictions became final prior\nto Padilla therefore cannot benefit from its holding. We\naccordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Seventh Circuit.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   16 Chaidez makes two back-up arguments in her merits briefs—that\n\nTeague’s bar on retroactivity does not apply when a petitioner chal­\nlenges a federal conviction, or at least does not do so when she makes a\nclaim of ineffective assistance. Brief for Petitioner 27–39. But Chaidez\ndid not include those issues in her petition for certiorari. Nor, still\nmore critically, did she adequately raise them in the lower courts. Only\nher petition for rehearing en banc in the Seventh Circuit at all ques­\ntioned Teague’s applicability, and her argument there—that a “Teague­\nlight” standard should apply to challenges to federal convictions—\ndiffers from the ones she has made in this Court. See Petition for\nRehearing and for Rehearing En Banc in No. 10–3623 (CA7), p. 13.\nMoreover, we cannot find any case in which a federal court has consid­\nered Chaidez’s contention that Teague should not apply to ineffective\nassistance claims. “[M]indful that we are a court of review, not of first\nview,” we decline to rule on Chaidez’s new arguments.

Kentucky, 559 U. S. 356 (2010), this Court\nheld that the Sixth Amendment requires an attorney for\na criminal defendant to apprise his client of the risk of\ndeportation created by a guilty plea. I dissented. The\nSixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal prosecu-\ntions,” an accused enjoys the right “to have the Assistance\nof Counsel for his defence.” By its terms, this right ex-\ntends “to legal advice directly related to defense against\nprosecution of the charged offense,” and “[t]here is no\nbasis in text or in principle” to expand the reach of this\nguarantee to guidance concerning the collateral conse-\nquences of a guilty plea.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [February 20, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG\njoins, dissenting.\n   The Court holds today that Padilla v. Kentucky, 559\nU. S. ___ (2010), announced a “new” rule within the mean­\ning of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 301 (1989), and so\ndoes not apply to convictions that became final before its\nannouncement. That is wrong, because Padilla did noth­\ning more than apply the existing rule of Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), in a new setting, the\nsame way the Court has done repeatedly in the past: by\nsurveying the relevant professional norms and conclud-\ning that they unequivocally required attorneys to provide\nadvice about the immigration consequences of a guilty\nplea. Because Padilla fell squarely within the metes and\nbounds established by Strickland, I respectfully dissent.\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n  The majority correctly sets forth the governing legal\nprinciples under Teague and Strickland. Ante, at 4–5.\nThe Teague inquiry turns centrally on the “nature of the\nrule” in question, and for that reason, “[w]here the begin­\nning point is a rule of . . . general application, . . . it will be\nthe infrequent case that yields a result so novel that it\nforges a new rule.” Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 308–309\n(1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment); see ante, at\n2                   CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n4–5. The majority makes the important observation that\n“when all we do is apply a general standard to the kind\nof factual circumstances it was meant to address, we will\nrarely state a new rule.” Ibid. It makes sense, then, that\n“garden-variety applications of . . . Strickland . . . do not\nproduce new rules.” Ante, at 5.\n   In Strickland, we did not provide a comprehensive def-\ninition of deficient performance, and instead held that\n“[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains\nsimply reasonableness under prevailing professional\nnorms.” 466 U. S., at 688. Strickland’s reasonableness\nprong therefore takes its content from the standards by\nwhich lawyers judge their professional obligations, ibid.,\nand those standards are subject to change. That is why,\ndespite the many different settings in which it has been\napplied, we have never found that an application of Strick-\nland resulted in a new rule.1\n   Significantly, we have previously found that applica­\ntions of Strickland to new factual scenarios are not barred\nunder 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) of the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). Section 2254(d)(1)\nprecludes habeas relief unless a state court decision vio­\nlates “clearly established Federal law,” which, as relevant\nhere, largely overlaps with the inquiry under Teague of\nwhether a decision was “dictated by precedent.” 489 U. S.,\n\n——————\n    1 See,\n         e.g., Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (incorrect\nadvice leading to a plea offer’s rejection); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.

S.\n510, 522 (2003), for example, we found that Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000), “made no new law” when it\nheld that Strickland extended to an attorney’s responsibil­\nity to conduct a background investigation in a capital case.\nRather, we explained that “in referring to the ABA Stand­\nards for Criminal Justice as guides, [Williams] applied\nthe same ‘clearly established’ precedent of Strickland we\napply today.” 539 U. S., at 522. Similarly, in Lafler v.\nCooper, 566 U. S. ___, ___, ___–___ (2012) (slip op., at 6,\n14–16), we rejected the argument advanced by the Solici­\ntor General that the Sixth Amendment did not extend to\nadvice about a plea offer because it did not impact the\nfairness of the trial. Instead, we simply held that Strick-\nland applied to this form of attorney misconduct.\n   In short, where we merely apply Strickland in a way\nthat corresponds to an evolution in professional norms, we\nmake no new law.\n                             B\n  Contrary to the majority’s reconstruction, Padilla is\nbuilt squarely on the foundation laid out by Strickland.\nPadilla relied upon controlling precedent. It began by\nreciting the basic rule that “[u]nder Strickland, we first\ndetermine whether counsel’s representation ‘fell below an\nobjective standard of reasonableness.’ ” Padilla, 559 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n688). We recognized that “[t]he first prong—constitutional\ndeficiency—is necessarily linked to the practice and expec­\ntations of the legal community: ‘[t]he proper measure of\n——————\n  2 AEDPA of course differs from the Teague rule in other important\n\nrespects. See, e.g., Greene v. Fisher, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 5). But these differences aside, the fact that we have repeatedly\nfound AEDPA cases involving Strickland to be controlled by established\nprecedent underscores that the application of Strickland in a new\ncontext should almost never result in a new rule.\n4                CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nattorney performance remains reasonableness under pre-\nvailing professional norms.’ ” Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9) (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688).\n   We therefore examined the substantial changes in fed-\neral immigration law that provided the backdrop to the\nrelevant professional standards. Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 2–6). Pursuant to the Immigration Act of\n1917, 39 Stat. 889–890, a judge could recommend that a\ndefendant who had committed a deportable offense not\nbe removed from the country. Congress entirely eliminated\nthis procedure in 1990. 104 Stat. 5050. Then the Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009–596, abolished the Attor-\nney General’s authority to grant discretionary relief from\nremoval for all but a small number of offenses. Padilla,\n559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). These changes in immi­\ngration law meant that for a noncitizen who committed\na removable offense, “removal [had become] practically\ninevitable.” Ibid.\n   In parallel with these developments, the standards of\nprofessional responsibility relating to immigration had\nbecome more demanding. “For at least the past 15 years,”\nwe observed in Padilla, “professional norms have gener-\nally imposed an obligation on counsel to provide advice on\nthe deportation consequences of a client’s plea.” Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 15). Citing an array of practice guides and\nprofessional responsibility manuals, we noted that “[t]he\nweight of prevailing professional norms supports the view\nthat counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of\ndeportation.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). Indeed, “authori­\nties of every stripe—including the American Bar Associa­\ntion, criminal defense and public defender organizations,\nauthoritative treatises, and state and city bar publica­\ntions—universally require defense attorneys to advise as\nto the risk of deportation consequences for non-citizen\nclients.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    5\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nmarks omitted).\n   We drew further support for our conclusion that profes­\nsional standards required advice about deportation conse­\nquences from our decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289\n(2001). See Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(citing St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 323). In St. Cyr, we had\nexplained that the availability of discretionary relief from\nremoval was critical to a noncitizen’s decision to accept a\nplea offer, and expected counsel to follow the instructions\nof “numerous practice guides,” such as the ABA’s Stand­\nards for Criminal Justice, to inform themselves of the\npossible immigration consequences of a plea. Padilla, 559\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (citing St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at\n323, n. 50); see id., at 322, n. 48. And we there found that\nmany States already required that a trial judge advise\ndefendants of the same. Ibid. St. Cyr thus “recognized\nthat ‘preserving the client’s right to remain in the United\nStates may be more important to the client than any\npotential jail sentence.’ ” Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10) (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 322).\n   Our application of Strickland in Padilla followed natu­\nrally from these earlier observations about changes in\nimmigration law and the accompanying evolution of pro­\nfessional norms. When we decided St. Cyr and Padilla,\nnothing about Strickland’s substance or applicability had\nchanged. The only difference from prior law was that\nthe underlying professional norms had changed such that\ncounsel’s failure to give this advice now amounted to\nconstitutionally deficient performance.3 Both before Pa-\n——————\n   3 Even before IIRIRA and St. Cyr, lawyers of course understood that\n\nit was good practice to inform clients of the deportation consequences of\na plea. See ante, at 14, n. 15 (citing 3 ABA Project on Standards for\nCriminal Justice, Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty §3.2(b), Com­\nmentary, p. 71 (App. Draft 1968)). Following the sea change in immi­\ngration law, however, the professional norms had become so established\nand universally recognized that the measure of constitutionally ade­\n6                  CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ndilla and after, counsel was obligated to follow the rele­\nvant professional norms. It was only because those norms\nreflected changes in immigration law that Padilla reached\nthe result it did, not because the Sixth Amendment right\nhad changed at all.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   Accepting that routine applications of Strickland do not\nresult in new rules, the majority nevertheless holds that\nPadilla went a step further. In its view, Padilla “ ‘br[oke]\nnew ground’ ” by addressing the threshold question of\nwhether advice about deportation is a collateral conse­\nquence of a criminal conviction that falls within the scope\nof the Sixth Amendment. Ante, at 9–10. But that is\nwrong, because Padilla declined to embrace the very\ndistinction between collateral and direct consequences of a\ncriminal conviction that the majority says it did. In fact,\nthe Court stated very clearly that it found the distinction\nirrelevant for the purposes of determining a defense law­\nyer’s obligation to provide advice about the immigration\nconsequences of a plea. 559 U. S., at ___, n. 8 (slip op.,\nat 7, n. 8). We asserted that we had “never applied a dis­\ntinction between direct and collateral consequences to\ndefine the scope of constitutionally ‘reasonable professional\nassistance’ required under Strickland,” and concluded that\n“[w]hether that distinction is appropriate is a question we\nneed not consider in this case.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8)\n(emphasis added). The distinction was “ill suited” to the\ntask at hand, we explained, because deportation has a\n“close connection to the criminal process,” and is “uniquely\ndifficult to classify as either a direct or a collateral conse­\nquence.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8–9). Indeed, “[o]ur law\n\n—————— \n\nquate performance now included giving such advice in the form Padilla\n\nrecognized. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

With­\nout this revision to our recent decisional history, the ma­\njority’s analysis unravels.\n                              B\n  The majority finds that the “legal landscape,” Graham v.\nCollins, 506 U. S. 461, 468 (1993), before Padilla was\nnearly uniform in its rejection of Strickland’s application\nto the deportation consequences of a plea. Ante, at 7–10.\nIt concludes that the lower courts were generally in\nagreement that the Sixth Amendment did not require\nattorneys to inform clients of the collateral consequences\nof a plea, and that this weighs heavily in favor of finding\nthat Padilla announced a new rule. Ante, at 7–8, nn. 7, 8.\nBut the majority’s discussion of these precedents operates\nat too high a level of generality and fails to account for the\n——————\n   4 See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.

St. Cyr\nnoted the importance of advising clients about immigra­\ntion consequences was of recent vintage, indeed more re-\ncent than some of the cases the majority cites. See 533\nU. S., at 322–323. The Court relies upon decisions issued\nover a period that spans more than 30 years. See ante, at\n7–8, nn. 7, 8. Nearly half of them (17) were decided before\nthe enactment of IIRIRA. See ibid. And all but two of\nthe Federal Court of Appeals cases were decided before St.\nCyr. See ante, at 7–8, nn. 7, 8. These earlier decisions\nshow nothing more than that the underlying professional\nnorms had not yet evolved to require attorneys to provide\nadvice about deportation consequences.\n   Cases from the period following IIRIRA and St. Cyr\nundermine the majority’s generalizations about the state\nof the law before Padilla. Deportation had long been un-\nderstood by lower courts to present “the most difficult”\npenalty to classify as either a collateral or direct conse­\nquence. United States v. Russell, 686 F. 2d 35, 38 (CADC\n1982); cf. Janvier v. United States, 793 F. 2d 449, 455\n(CA2 1986) (holding that Strickland applied to advice\nabout a judicial recommendation against deportation).\nEventually, and in parallel with changes in federal immi­\ngration law and the corresponding professional norms, the\nlower courts had acknowledged an important qualification\nto the collateral consequences rule. After the passage of\nIIRIRA and this Court’s decision in St. Cyr, many courts\nconcluded that a lawyer’s affirmative misstatements about\nthe immigration consequences of a guilty plea can consti­\ntute deficient performance under Strickland. Indeed, each\nFederal Court of Appeals to address the question after St.\nCyr so held. See United States v. Couto, 311 F. 3d 179,\n188 (CA2 2002); United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d 1005,\n1015 (CA9 2005); cf. Downs-Morgan v. United States, 765\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

They also fore­\nshadowed the Court’s reasoning in Padilla by basing their\nanalysis of the relevant professional norms on the special\nnature of deportation, the ABA standards governing im­\nmigration practice, and the Court’s assessment of those\nstandards in St Cyr. See Kwan, 407 F. 3d, at 1016 (“That\ncounsel may have misled [the defendant] out of ignorance\nis no excuse. It is a basic rule of professional conduct that\na lawyer must . . .

Ante, at 12–13. But, as explained, the reasoning of\nthese cases renders that characterization at best incom­\nplete. See, e.g., Kwan, 407 F. 3d, at 1016. While these\nlower court precedents are consistent with the general\nprinciple that attorneys should not mislead clients by\nproviding incorrect advice, they did not rest primarily on\nthat rule. Rather, they recognized the significant changes\nin professional norms that predated Padilla and that we\nhad noted in St. Cyr. As a consequence, the “wall between\ndirect and collateral consequences” that the lower courts\nhad erected, ante, at 9, had already been dealt a serious\nblow by the time the Court decided Padilla.\n   As the majority points out, these misrepresentation\ncases stopped short of imposing an affirmative obligation\non lawyers to consult with clients about the consequences\nof deportation. Ante, at 12–13. But the majority places\ntoo much emphasis on the absence of lower court authority\nfinding that an attorney’s omissions with respect to depor­\ntation resulted in ineffective assistance. The distinction\nbetween omissions and affirmative misrepresentations on\nwhich these lower court cases depended cannot be recon­\nciled with Strickland. In Padilla itself, we rejected the\nSolicitor General’s suggestion that Strickland should\napply to advice about the immigration consequences of a\nplea only in cases where defense counsel makes an affirm­\native misstatement. Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n12). We did so because we found that Strickland was\nincompatible with the distinction between an obligation to\ngive advice and a prohibition on affirmative misstate­\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Strickland made clear that its\nstandard of attorney performance applied to both “acts”\nand “omissions,” and that a rule limiting the performance\ninquiry to one or the other was too narrow. 466 U. S.,\nat 690. Thus, the distinction between misrepresentations\nand omissions, on which the majority relies in classifying\nlower court precedent, implies a categorical rule that is\ninconsistent with Strickland’s requirement of a case-by­\ncase assessment of an attorney’s performance.7 Id., at\n688–689; see, e.g., Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470, 479\n(2000). In short, that some courts have differentiated\nbetween misleading by silence and affirmative misrep-\nresentation hardly establishes the rationality of the dis­\ntinction. Notably, the Court offers no reasoned basis for\nbelieving that such a distinction can be extracted from\nStrickland.\n   To be sure, lower courts did continue to apply the dis­\ntinction between collateral and direct consequences after\nSt. Cyr. See ante, at 13–14; see, e.g., Broomes v. Ashcroft,\n358 F. 3d 1251, 1256–1257 (CA10 2004). Even so, and\neven assuming the misrepresentation cases did not call\nthe distinction into question, the existence of these lower\ncourt decisions is not dispositive. “[T]he standard for\ndetermining when a case establishes a new rule is ‘objec­\ntive,’ and the mere existence of conflicting authority does\n——————\n  7 The majority cites a law review article for the proposition that the\ncategorical consequences rule is “one of ‘the most widely recognized\nrules of American law.’ ” Ante, at 8 (quoting Chin & Holmes, Effective\nAssistance of Counsel and the Consequences of Guilty Pleas, 87 Cornell\nL. Rev. 697, 706 (2002)). But the article was, in fact, quite critical of\nthe rule. The authors explained that “[t]he real work of the conviction\nis performed by the collateral consequences,” and that the direct/\ncollateral distinction in the context of ineffective-assistance claims\nwas “surprising because it seems inconsistent with the framework that\nthe Supreme Court . . . laid out” in Strickland. Chin & Holmes, at\n700–701.\n12               CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nnot necessarily mean a rule is new.” Wright, 505 U.

S. 461, 506 (1993) (Souter, J., dissenting).\n   Where the application of Strickland was straightfor­\nward, rooted in 15 years of professional standards and the\nCourt’s prior St. Cyr decision, there is no reason to put\nthese lower court cases, many from more than a decade\nearlier, ahead of this Court’s simple and clear reasoning in\nPadilla. Nevertheless, the majority reaches the paradoxi­\ncal conclusion that by declining to apply a collateral­\nconsequence doctrine the Court had never adopted, Pa-\ndilla announced a new rule.\n                              III\n   What truly appears to drive the majority’s analysis is its\nsense that Padilla occasioned a serious disruption in lower\ncourt decisional reasoning. See, e.g., ante, at 9–10 (“If that\ndoes not count as ‘break[ing] new ground’ . . . we are hard\npressed to know what would” (quoting Teague, 489 U. S.,\nat 301)). The concurring and dissenting opinions in Pa-\ndilla similarly reflected the impression that it was a sig­\nnificant and destabilizing decision. See 559 U. S., at ___\n(ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3); id., at\n___ (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5) (describing the\nmajority opinion as a “sledge hammer”); ante, at 8–9, n.\n10. But the fact that a decision was perceived as momen­\ntous or consequential, particularly by those who disagreed\nwith it, does not control in the Teague analysis. Faithfully\napplying the Teague rule depends instead on an examina­\ntion of this Court’s reasoning and an objective assessment\nof the precedent at issue. Stringer, 503 U. S., at 237. In\nPadilla, we did nothing more than apply Strickland.

Argued November 1, 2012—Decided February 20, 2013\nImmigration officials initiated removal proceedings against petitioner\n  Chaidez in 2009 upon learning that she had pleaded guilty to mail\n  fraud in 2004. To avoid removal, she sought to overturn that convic-\n  tion by filing a petition for a writ of coram nobis, contending that her\n  former attorney’s failure to advise her of the guilty plea’s immigra-\n  tion consequences constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under\n  the Sixth Amendment. While her petition was pending, this Court\n  held in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, that the Sixth Amendment\n  requires defense attorneys to inform non-citizen clients of the depor-\n  tation risks of guilty pleas. The District Court vacated Chaidez’s\n  conviction, determining that Padilla did not announce a “new rule”\n  under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, and thus applied to Chaidez’s\n  case. The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Padilla had de-\n  clared a new rule and should not apply in a challenge to a final con-\n  viction.\nHeld: Padilla does not apply retroactively to cases already final on di-\n rect review. Pp. 3−15.\n    (a) Under Teague, a person whose conviction is already final may\n not benefit from a new rule of criminal procedure on collateral re-\n view. A “case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by\n precedent existing at the time the defendant’s conviction became fi-\n nal.” Teague, 489 U. S., at 301. And a holding is not so dictated un-\n less it would have been “apparent to all reasonable jurists.” Lambrix\n v. Singletary, 520 U. S. 518, 527−528. At the same time, a case does\n not “announce a new rule, [when] it [is] merely an application of the\n principle that governed” a prior decision to a different set of facts.\n Teague, 489 U. S., at 307. Thus, garden-variety applications of the\n test in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, for assessing ineffec-\n2                     CHAIDEZ v.

Before deciding if failing to inform a\n    client about the risk of deportation “fell below [Strickland’s] objective\n    standard of reasonableness,” 466 U. S., at 688, Padilla first consid-\n    ered the threshold question whether advice about deportation was\n    “categorically removed” from the scope of the Sixth Amendment right\n    to counsel because it involved only a “collateral consequence” of a\n    conviction, rather than a component of a criminal sentence, 559 U. S.,\n    at ___. That is, prior to asking how the Strickland test applied, Pa-\n    dilla asked whether that test applied at all.\n       That preliminary question came to the Court unsettled. Hill v.\n    Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, had explicitly left open whether the Sixth\n    Amendment right extends to collateral consequences. That left the\n    issue to the state and lower federal courts, and they almost unani-\n    mously concluded that the Sixth Amendment does not require attor-\n    neys to inform their clients of a conviction’s collateral consequences,\n    including deportation. Padilla’s contrary ruling thus answered an\n    open question about the Sixth Amendment’s reach, in a way that al-\n    tered the law of most jurisdictions. In so doing, Padilla broke new\n    ground and imposed a new obligation. Pp. 3−11.\n       (b) Chaidez argues that Padilla did no more than apply Strickland\n    to a new set of facts. But she ignores that Padilla had to develop new\n    law to determine that Strickland applied at all. The few lower court\n    decisions she cites held only that a lawyer may not affirmatively mis-\n    represent his expertise or otherwise actively mislead his client as to\n    any important matter. Those rulings do not apply to her case, and\n    they do not show that all reasonable judges thought that lawyers had\n    to advise their clients about deportation risks. Neither does INS v.\n    St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, have any relevance here. In saying that a rea-\n    sonably competent lawyer would tell a non-citizen client about a\n    guilty plea’s deportation consequences, St. Cyr did not determine that\n    the Sixth Amendment requires a lawyer to provide such information.\n    It took Padilla to decide that question.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [February 20, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___ (2010), this Court\nheld that the Sixth Amendment requires an attorney for\na criminal defendant to provide advice about the risk of\ndeportation arising from a guilty plea. We consider here\nwhether that ruling applies retroactively, so that a person\nwhose conviction became final before we decided Padilla\ncan benefit from it. We conclude that, under the prin­\nciples set out in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989),\nPadilla does not have retroactive effect.\n                            I\n  Petitioner Roselva Chaidez hails from Mexico, but be­\ncame a lawful permanent resident of the United States\nin 1977. About 20 years later, she helped to defraud an\nautomobile insurance company out of $26,000. After\nfederal agents uncovered the scheme, Chaidez pleaded\nguilty to two counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18\nU. S. C. §1341. The District Court sentenced her to four\nyears of probation and ordered her to pay restitution.\nChaidez’s conviction became final in 2004.\n  Under federal immigration law, the offenses to which\nChaidez pleaded guilty are “aggravated felonies,” subject­\n2                   CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ning her to mandatory removal from this country. See 8\nU. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(M)(i), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). But accord­\ning to Chaidez, her attorney never advised her of that fact,\nand at the time of her plea she remained ignorant of it.\n   Immigration officials initiated removal proceedings\nagainst Chaidez in 2009, after an application she made for\ncitizenship alerted them to her prior conviction. To avoid\nremoval, Chaidez sought to overturn that conviction by\nfiling a petition for a writ of coram nobis in Federal Dis­\ntrict Court.1 She argued that her former attorney’s failure\nto advise her of the immigration consequences of pleading\nguilty constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under\nthe Sixth Amendment.\n   While Chaidez’s petition was pending, this Court decided\nPadilla. Our ruling vindicated Chaidez’s view of the\nSixth Amendment: We held that criminal defense attor­\nneys must inform non-citizen clients of the risks of depor­\ntation arising from guilty pleas. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9). But the Government argued that Chaidez could\nnot benefit from Padilla because it announced a “new\nrule” and, under Teague, such rules do not apply in collat­\neral challenges to already-final convictions.\n   The District Court determined that Padilla “did not\nannounce a new rule for Teague purposes,” and therefore\nshould apply to Chaidez’s case. 730 F. Supp. 2d 896, 904\n(ND Ill. 2010). It then found that Chaidez’s counsel had\nperformed deficiently under Padilla and that Chaidez\nsuffered prejudice as a result. Accordingly, the court\nvacated Chaidez’s conviction. See No. 03 CR 636–6, 2010\n——————\n  1 A petition for a writ of coram nobis provides a way to collaterally\n\nattack a criminal conviction for a person, like Chaidez, who is no longer\n“in custody” and therefore cannot seek habeas relief under 28 U. S. C.\n§2255 or §2241. See United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502, 507, 510–\n511 (1954). Chaidez and the Government agree that nothing in this\ncase turns on the difference between a coram nobis petition and a\nhabeas petition, and we assume without deciding that they are correct.\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

And state and lower\nfederal courts had uniformly concluded that an attorney\nneed not give “advice concerning [such a] collateral (as\nopposed to direct) consequenc[e] of a guilty plea.” Id., at\n690. According to the Seventh Circuit, Padilla’s holding\nwas new because it ran counter to that widely accepted\n“distinction between direct and collateral consequences.”\n655 F. 3d, at 691. Judge Williams dissented. Agreeing\nwith the Third Circuit’s view, she argued that Padilla\n“broke no new ground” because it merely applied estab­\nlished law about a lawyer’s “duty to consult” with a client.\n655 F. 3d, at 695 (quoting United States v. Orocio, 645\nF. 3d 630, 638–639 (CA3 2011) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   We granted certiorari, 566 U. S. ___ (2012), to resolve a\nsplit among federal and state courts on whether Padilla\napplies retroactively.2 Holding that it does not, we affirm\nthe Seventh Circuit.\n                         II\n  Teague makes the retroactivity of our criminal proce­\n——————\n  2 Compare 655 F. 3d 684 (CA7 2011) (case below) (not retroactive);\n\nUnited States v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndure decisions turn on whether they are novel. When we\nannounce a “new rule,” a person whose conviction is al­\nready final may not benefit from the decision in a habeas\nor similar proceeding.3 Only when we apply a settled rule\nmay a person avail herself of the decision on collateral\nreview. Here, Chaidez filed her coram nobis petition five\nyears after her guilty plea became final. Her challenge\ntherefore fails if Padilla declared a new rule.\n  “[A] case announces a new rule,” Teague explained,\n“when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation”\non the government. 489 U. S., at 301. “To put it differ­\nently,” we continued, “a case announces a new rule if the\nresult was not dictated by precedent existing at the time\nthe defendant’s conviction became final.” Ibid. And a\nholding is not so dictated, we later stated, unless it would\nhave been “apparent to all reasonable jurists.” Lambrix v.\nSingletary, 520 U. S. 518, 527–528 (1997).\n  But that account has a flipside. Teague also made clear\nthat a case does not “announce a new rule, [when] it ‘[is]\nmerely an application of the principle that governed’ ” a\nprior decision to a different set of facts. 489 U. S., at 307\n(quoting Yates v. Aiken, 484 U. S. 211, 217 (1988)). As\nJUSTICE KENNEDY has explained, “[w]here the beginning\npoint” of our analysis is a rule of “general application, a\nrule designed for the specific purpose of evaluating a\nmyriad of factual contexts, it will be the infrequent case\nthat yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule, one\nnot dictated by precedent.” Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277,\n309 (1992) (concurring in judgment); see also Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 362, 391 (2000). Otherwise said, when\nall we do is apply a general standard to the kind of factual\n——————\n   3 Teague stated two exceptions: “[W]atershed rules of criminal proce­\n\ndure” and rules placing “conduct beyond the power of the [government]\nto proscribe” apply on collateral review, even if novel. 489 U. S., at 311\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Chaidez does not argue that either\nof those exceptions is relevant here.\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncircumstances it was meant to address, we will rarely\nstate a new rule for Teague purposes.\n   Because that is so, garden-variety applications of the\ntest in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), for\nassessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel do\nnot produce new rules. In Strickland, we held that legal\nrepresentation violates the Sixth Amendment if it falls\n“below an objective standard of reasonableness,” as indi­\ncated by “prevailing professional norms,” and the defend­\nant suffers prejudice as a result. Id., at 687–688. That\nstandard, we later concluded, “provides sufficient guidance\nfor resolving virtually all” claims of ineffective assistance,\neven though their particular circumstances will differ.\nWilliams, 529 U. S., at 391. And so we have granted relief\nunder Strickland in diverse contexts without ever suggest­\ning that doing so required a new rule. See, e.g., ibid.;\nRompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith,\n539 U. S. 510 (2003).4 In like manner, Padilla would not\nhave created a new rule had it only applied Strickland’s\ngeneral standard to yet another factual situation—that is,\nhad Padilla merely made clear that a lawyer who neglects\nto inform a client about the risk of deportation is profes­\nsionally incompetent.\n   But Padilla did something more. Before deciding if\nfailing to provide such advice “fell below an objective stan­\ndard of reasonableness,” Padilla considered a threshold\nquestion: Was advice about deportation “categorically\nremoved” from the scope of the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel because it involved only a “collateral consequence”\nof a conviction, rather than a component of the criminal\n\n——————\n  4 We did not consider Teague in Williams, Rompilla, and Wiggins, but\n\nwe granted habeas relief pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) because\nstate courts had unreasonably applied “clearly established” law. And,\nas we have explained, “clearly established” law is not “new” within the\nmeaning of Teague. See Williams, 529 U. S., at 412.\n6                    CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsentence? 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7–9).5 In other\nwords, prior to asking how the Strickland test applied\n(“Did this attorney act unreasonably?”), Padilla asked\nwhether the Strickland test applied (“Should we even\nevaluate if this attorney acted unreasonably?”). And as we\nwill describe, that preliminary question about Strickland’s\nambit came to the Padilla Court unsettled—so that the\nCourt’s answer (“Yes, Strickland governs here”) required a\nnew rule.\n  The relevant background begins with our decision in\nHill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), which explicitly left\nopen whether advice concerning a collateral consequence\nmust satisfy Sixth Amendment requirements. Hill pleaded\nguilty to first-degree murder after his attorney misin­\nformed him about his parole eligibility. In addressing his\nclaim of ineffective assistance, we first held that the\nStrickland standard extends generally to the plea process.\nSee Hill, 474 U. S., at 57. We then determined, however,\nthat Hill had failed to allege prejudice from the lawyer’s\nerror and so could not prevail under that standard. See\nid., at 60. That conclusion allowed us to avoid another,\nmore categorical question: whether advice about parole\n(however inadequate and prejudicial) could possibly vio­\nlate the Sixth Amendment. The Court of Appeals, we\nnoted, had held “that parole eligibility is a collateral ra­\nther than a direct consequence of a guilty plea, of which a\ndefendant need not be informed.” Id., at 55. But our\nruling on prejudice made “it unnecessary to determine\nwhether there may be circumstances under which” ad-\n——————\n   5 We have never attempted to delineate the world of “collateral conse­\n\nquences,” see Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___, n. 8 (slip op., at 7, n. 8), nor do\nwe do so here. But other effects of a conviction commonly viewed as\ncollateral include civil commitment, civil forfeiture, sex offender regis­\ntration, disqualification from public benefits, and disfranchisement.\nSee id., at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2–3)\n(listing other examples).\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Id., at 60.6\n   That non-decision left the state and lower federal courts\nto deal with the issue; and they almost unanimously con­\ncluded that the Sixth Amendment does not require attor­\nneys to inform their clients of a conviction’s collateral\nconsequences, including deportation. All 10 federal appel­\nlate courts to consider the question decided, in the words\nof one, that “counsel’s failure to inform a defendant of the\ncollateral consequences of a guilty plea is never” a viola­\ntion of the Sixth Amendment. Santos-Sanchez v. United\nStates, 548 F. 3d 327, 334 (CA5 2008).7 That constitutional\nguarantee, another typical decision expounded, “assures\nan accused of effective assistance of counsel in ‘criminal\nprosecutions’ ”; accordingly, advice about matters like de-\nportation, which are “not a part of or enmeshed in the\ncriminal proceeding,” does not fall within the Amend­\nment’s scope. United States v. George, 869 F. 2d 333, 337\n(CA7 1989). Appellate courts in almost 30 States agreed.8\n——————\n   6 In saying that much, we declined to rule not only on whether advice\n\nabout a conviction’s collateral consequences falls outside the Sixth\nAmendment’s scope, but also on whether parole eligibility should be\nconsidered such a consequence, as the court of appeals held.\n   7 See Broomes v.

Post, at 10\n(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). We instead point to the presence of lower\ncourt authority—in case after case and jurisdiction after jurisdiction—\nholding that such a failure, because relating to a collateral matter,\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)        9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   So when we decided Padilla, we answered a question\nabout the Sixth Amendment’s reach that we had left open,\nin a way that altered the law of most jurisdictions—and\nour reasoning reflected that we were doing as much. In\nthe normal Strickland case, a court begins by evaluating\nthe reasonableness of an attorney’s conduct in light of\nprofessional norms, and then assesses prejudice. But as\nearlier indicated, see supra, at 5–6, Padilla had a different\nstarting point. Before asking whether the performance\nof Padilla’s attorney was deficient under Strickland, we\nconsidered (in a separately numbered part of the opinion)\nwhether Strickland applied at all. See 559 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 7–9). Many courts, we acknowledged, had\nexcluded advice about collateral matters from the Sixth\nAmendment’s ambit; and deportation, because the conse­\nquence of a distinct civil proceeding, could well be viewed\nas such a matter. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But, we\ncontinued, no decision of our own committed us to “appl[y]\na distinction between direct and collateral consequences to\ndefine the scope” of the right to counsel. Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 8). And however apt that distinction might be in\nother contexts, it should not exempt from Sixth Amend­\nment scrutiny a lawyer’s advice (or non-advice) about\na plea’s deportation risk. Deportation, we stated, is\n“unique.” Ibid. It is a “particularly severe” penalty, and\none “intimately related to the criminal process”; indeed,\nimmigration statutes make it “nearly an automatic result”\nof some convictions. Ibid. We thus resolved the threshold\nquestion before us by breaching the previously chink-free\nwall between direct and collateral consequences: Notwith­\nstanding the then-dominant view, “Strickland applies to\nPadilla’s claim.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n   If that does not count as “break[ing] new ground” or\n“impos[ing] a new obligation,” we are hard pressed to\n\n—————— \n\ncould not do so. \n\n10                  CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nknow what would. Teague, 489 U. S., at 301. Before\nPadilla, we had declined to decide whether the Sixth\nAmendment had any relevance to a lawyer’s advice about\nmatters not part of a criminal proceeding. Perhaps some\nadvice of that kind would have to meet Strickland’s rea­\nsonableness standard—but then again, perhaps not: No\nprecedent of our own “dictated” the answer. Teague, 489\nU. S., at 301. And as the lower courts filled the vacuum,\nthey almost uniformly insisted on what Padilla called the\n“categorica[l] remov[al]” of advice about a conviction’s non­\ncriminal consequences—including deportation—from the\nSixth Amendment’s scope. 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\nIt was Padilla that first rejected that categorical ap­\nproach—and so made the Strickland test operative—when\na criminal lawyer gives (or fails to give) advice about\nimmigration consequences.11 In acknowledging that fact,\nwe do not cast doubt on, or at all denigrate, Padilla.\nCourts often need to, and do, break new ground; it is the\nvery premise of Teague that a decision can be right and\nalso be novel. All we say here is that Padilla’s holding\nthat the failure to advise about a non-criminal conse­\n——————\n   11 The separate opinions in Padilla objected to just this aspect of the\n\nCourt’s ruling. Dissents have been known to exaggerate the novelty\nof majority opinions; and “the mere existence of a dissent,” like the\nexistence of conflicting authority in state or lower federal courts, does\nnot establish that a rule is new. Beard v. Banks, 542 U. S. 406, 416,\nn. 5 (2004); see Williams, 529 U. S., at 410. But the concurring and\ndissenting opinions in Padilla were on to something when they de­\nscribed the line the Court was crossing. “Until today,” JUSTICE ALITO\nwrote, “the longstanding and unanimous position of the federal courts\nwas that reasonable defense counsel generally need only advise a client\nabout the direct consequences of a criminal conviction.” See 559 U. S.,\nat ___ (concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2). Or again, this time from\nJUSTICE SCALIA: “[U]ntil today,” the Sixth Amendment guaranteed only\n“legal advice directly related to defense against prosecution” of a\ncriminal charge. Id., at ___ (dissenting) (slip op., at 2). One need not\nagree with any of the separate opinions’ criticisms of Padilla to concur\nwith their view that it modified governing law.\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                 11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nquence could violate the Sixth Amendment would not have\nbeen—in fact, was not—“apparent to all reasonable ju­\nrists” prior to our decision. Lambrix, 520 U. S., at 527–\n528. Padilla thus announced a “new rule.”\n                             III\n   Chaidez offers, and the dissent largely adopts, a differ­\nent account of Padilla, in which we did no more than\napply Strickland to a new set of facts. On Chaidez’s view,\nStrickland insisted “[f]rom its inception” that all aspects of\na criminal lawyer’s performance pass a test of “ ‘reasona­\nbleness under prevailing professional norms’ ”: The deci­\nsion thus foreclosed any “categorical distinction between\ndirect and collateral consequences.” Brief for Petitioner\n21–22 (emphasis deleted) (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S.,\nat 688). Indeed, Chaidez contends, courts prior to Padilla\nrecognized Strickland’s all-encompassing scope and so\napplied its reasonableness standard to advice concerning\ndeportation. See Brief for Petitioner 25–26; Reply Brief\n10–12. She here points to caselaw in three federal appeals\ncourts allowing ineffective assistance claims when attor­\nneys affirmatively misled their clients about the deporta­\ntion consequences of guilty pleas.12 The only question left\nfor Padilla to resolve, Chaidez claims, was whether pro­\nfessional norms also require criminal lawyers to volunteer\nadvice about the risk of deportation. In addressing that\nissue, she continues, Padilla did a run-of-the-mill Strick-\nland analysis. And more: It did an especially easy Strick-\nland analysis. We had earlier noted in INS v. St. Cyr, 533\nU. S. 289 (2001)—a case raising an issue of immigration\nlaw unrelated to the Sixth Amendment—that a “compe­\ntent defense counsel” would inform his client about a\nguilty plea’s deportation consequences. Id., at 323, n. 50.\n——————\n   12 See United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d 1005, 1015–1017 (CA9 2005);\n\nUnited States v. Couto, 311 F. 3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); Downs-Morgan\nv. United States, 765 F. 2d 1534, 1540–1541 (CA11 1985).\n12                  CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAll Padilla had to do, Chaidez concludes, was recite that\nprior finding.\n   But Chaidez’s (and the dissent’s) story line is wrong, for\nreasons we have mostly already noted: Padilla had to\ndevelop new law, establishing that the Sixth Amendment\napplied at all, before it could assess the performance of\nPadilla’s lawyer under Strickland. See supra, at 5–6, 9.\nOur first order of business was thus to consider whether\nthe widely accepted distinction between direct and collat­\neral consequences categorically foreclosed Padilla’s claim,\nwhatever the level of his attorney’s performance. We did\nnot think, as Chaidez argues, that Strickland barred\nresort to that distinction. Far from it: Even in Padilla we\ndid not eschew the direct-collateral divide across the\nboard. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (“Whether that\ndistinction is [generally] appropriate is a question we need\nnot consider in this case”). Rather, we relied on the spe­\ncial “nature of deportation”—the severity of the penalty\nand the “automatic” way it follows from conviction—to\nshow that “[t]he collateral versus direct distinction [was]\nill-suited” to dispose of Padilla’s claim. Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 8–9). All that reasoning came before we conducted a\nStrickland analysis (by examining professional norms and\nso forth), and none of it followed ineluctably from prior\nlaw.13\n——————\n   13 The dissent’s entire analysis founders on this most basic point. In\n\nits lengthy description of Padilla, the dissent picks up in the middle—\nafter the Court concluded that the direct-collateral distinction did not\npreclude finding that Padilla’s lawyer provided ineffective assistance\nunder the Sixth Amendment. See post, at 3–5. The dissent justifies\nignoring that threshold conclusion on the ground that “Padilla declined\nto embrace the . . . distinction between collateral and direct conse­\nquences” and “stated very clearly that it found the distinction irrele­\nvant” to the case. Post, at 6. But it is exactly in refusing to apply the\ndirect-collateral distinction that the Padilla Court did something novel.\nBefore then, as the Court forthrightly acknowledged, that distinction\nwould have doomed Padilla’s claim in well-nigh every court in the\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Predictably, then, the caselaw Chaidez and the dissent\ncite fails to support their claim that lower courts “accepted\nthat Strickland applied to deportation advice.” Brief for\nPetitioner 25; see post, at 8–11. True enough, three fed-\neral circuits (and a handful of state courts) held before Pa-\ndilla that misstatements about deportation could support\nan ineffective assistance claim. But those decisions rea­\nsoned only that a lawyer may not affirmatively misrepre­\nsent his expertise or otherwise actively mislead his client\non any important matter, however related to a criminal\nprosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d\n1005, 1015–1017 (CA9 2005). They co-existed happily\nwith precedent, from the same jurisdictions (and almost\nall others), holding that deportation is not “so unique as to\nwarrant an exception to the general rule that a defendant\nneed not be advised of the [collateral] consequences of a\nguilty plea.” United States v. Campbell, 778 F. 2d 764,\n769 (CA11 1985).14 So at most, Chaidez has shown that a\nminority of courts recognized a separate rule for material\nmisrepresentations, regardless whether they concerned\ndeportation or another collateral matter. That limited\nrule does not apply to Chaidez’s case. And because it lived\nin harmony with the exclusion of claims like hers from the\nSixth Amendment, it does not establish what she needs\nto—that all reasonable judges, prior to Padilla, thought\nthey were living in a Padilla-like world.\n   Nor, finally, does St. Cyr have any relevance here. That\n\n——————\nUnited States. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7); supra, at 9.\n   14 See also Resendiz v. Kovensky, 416 F. 3d 952, 957 (CA9 2005)\n\n(“[B]ecause immigration consequences remain collateral, the failure of\ncounsel to advise his client of the potential immigration consequences\nof a conviction does not violate the Sixth Amendment”); Russo v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision stated what is common sense (and what we again\nrecognized in Padilla): A reasonably competent lawyer will\ntell a non-citizen client about a guilty plea’s deportation\nconsequences because “ ‘[p]reserving the client’s right to\nremain in the United States may be more important to the\nclient than any potential jail sentence.’ ” Padilla, 559\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at\n322). But in saying that much, St. Cyr did not determine\nthat the Sixth Amendment requires a lawyer to provide\nsuch information. Courts had held to the contrary not\nbecause advice about deportation was insignificant to a\nclient—really, who could think that, whether before or\nafter St. Cyr?—but because it concerned a matter collat­\neral to the criminal prosecution.15 On those courts’ view,\nthe Sixth Amendment no more demanded competent\nadvice about a plea’s deportation consequences than it\ndemanded competent representation in the deportation\nprocess itself. Padilla decided that view was wrong. But\nto repeat: It was Padilla that did so. In the years follow­\ning St. Cyr, not a single state or lower federal court con­\nsidering a lawyer’s failure to provide deportation advice\n——————\n   15 The dissent claims the opposite, averring that lower court “deci­\n\nsions show nothing more than that the underlying professional norms\nhad not yet evolved to require attorneys to provide advice about depor­\ntation consequences.” Post, at 8. But the dissent cannot point to a\nsingle decision stating that a lawyer’s failure to offer advice about\ndeportation met professional norms; all the decisions instead held that\na lawyer’s breach of those norms was constitutionally irrelevant be­\ncause deportation was a collateral consequence. See supra, at 7. Had\ncourts in fact considered professional standards in the slew of cases\nbefore Padilla that presented Padilla-like claims, they would have\ndiscovered as early as 1968 that the American Bar Association in­\nstructed criminal lawyers to advise their non-citizen clients about the\nrisks of deportation. See 3 ABA Project on Standards for Criminal\nJustice, Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty §3.2(b), Commentary,\np. 71 (App. Draft 1968). The difficulty in upholding such claims prior to\nPadilla had nothing to do with courts’ view of professional norms and\neverything to do with their use of the direct-collateral divide.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nabandoned the distinction between direct and collateral\nconsequences, and several courts reaffirmed that divide.\nSee, e.g., Santos-Sanchez, 548 F. 3d, at 335–336; Broomes\nv. Ashcroft, 358 F. 3d 1251, 1256–1257 (CA10 2004);\nUnited States v. Fry, 322 F. 3d 1198, 1200–1201 (CA9 2003).\nIt took Padilla to decide that in assessing such a lawyer’s\nperformance, the Sixth Amendment sets the standard.16\n                           IV\n  This Court announced a new rule in Padilla. Under\nTeague, defendants whose convictions became final prior\nto Padilla therefore cannot benefit from its holding. We\naccordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Seventh Circuit.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   16 Chaidez makes two back-up arguments in her merits briefs—that\n\nTeague’s bar on retroactivity does not apply when a petitioner chal­\nlenges a federal conviction, or at least does not do so when she makes a\nclaim of ineffective assistance. Brief for Petitioner 27–39. But Chaidez\ndid not include those issues in her petition for certiorari. Nor, still\nmore critically, did she adequately raise them in the lower courts. Only\nher petition for rehearing en banc in the Seventh Circuit at all ques­\ntioned Teague’s applicability, and her argument there—that a “Teague­\nlight” standard should apply to challenges to federal convictions—\ndiffers from the ones she has made in this Court. See Petition for\nRehearing and for Rehearing En Banc in No. 10–3623 (CA7), p. 13.\nMoreover, we cannot find any case in which a federal court has consid­\nered Chaidez’s contention that Teague should not apply to ineffective\nassistance claims. “[M]indful that we are a court of review, not of first\nview,” we decline to rule on Chaidez’s new arguments.

The\nSixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal prosecu-\ntions,” an accused enjoys the right “to have the Assistance\nof Counsel for his defence.” By its terms, this right ex-\ntends “to legal advice directly related to defense against\nprosecution of the charged offense,” and “[t]here is no\nbasis in text or in principle” to expand the reach of this\nguarantee to guidance concerning the collateral conse-\nquences of a guilty plea.

S. 668 (1984), in a new setting, the\nsame way the Court has done repeatedly in the past: by\nsurveying the relevant professional norms and conclud-\ning that they unequivocally required attorneys to provide\nadvice about the immigration consequences of a guilty\nplea. Because Padilla fell squarely within the metes and\nbounds established by Strickland, I respectfully dissent.\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n  The majority correctly sets forth the governing legal\nprinciples under Teague and Strickland. Ante, at 4–5.\nThe Teague inquiry turns centrally on the “nature of the\nrule” in question, and for that reason, “[w]here the begin­\nning point is a rule of . . . general application, . . . it will be\nthe infrequent case that yields a result so novel that it\nforges a new rule.” Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 308–309\n(1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment); see ante, at\n2                   CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n4–5. The majority makes the important observation that\n“when all we do is apply a general standard to the kind\nof factual circumstances it was meant to address, we will\nrarely state a new rule.” Ibid. It makes sense, then, that\n“garden-variety applications of . . . Strickland . . . do not\nproduce new rules.” Ante, at 5.\n   In Strickland, we did not provide a comprehensive def-\ninition of deficient performance, and instead held that\n“[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains\nsimply reasonableness under prevailing professional\nnorms.” 466 U. S., at 688. Strickland’s reasonableness\nprong therefore takes its content from the standards by\nwhich lawyers judge their professional obligations, ibid.,\nand those standards are subject to change. That is why,\ndespite the many different settings in which it has been\napplied, we have never found that an application of Strick-\nland resulted in a new rule.1\n   Significantly, we have previously found that applica­\ntions of Strickland to new factual scenarios are not barred\nunder 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) of the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). Section 2254(d)(1)\nprecludes habeas relief unless a state court decision vio­\nlates “clearly established Federal law,” which, as relevant\nhere, largely overlaps with the inquiry under Teague of\nwhether a decision was “dictated by precedent.” 489 U. S.,\n\n——————\n    1 See,\n         e.g., Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (incorrect\nadvice leading to a plea offer’s rejection); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.

S.\n510, 522 (2003), for example, we found that Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000), “made no new law” when it\nheld that Strickland extended to an attorney’s responsibil­\nity to conduct a background investigation in a capital case.\nRather, we explained that “in referring to the ABA Stand­\nards for Criminal Justice as guides, [Williams] applied\nthe same ‘clearly established’ precedent of Strickland we\napply today.” 539 U. S., at 522. Similarly, in Lafler v.\nCooper, 566 U. S. ___, ___, ___–___ (2012) (slip op., at 6,\n14–16), we rejected the argument advanced by the Solici­\ntor General that the Sixth Amendment did not extend to\nadvice about a plea offer because it did not impact the\nfairness of the trial. Instead, we simply held that Strick-\nland applied to this form of attorney misconduct.\n   In short, where we merely apply Strickland in a way\nthat corresponds to an evolution in professional norms, we\nmake no new law.\n                             B\n  Contrary to the majority’s reconstruction, Padilla is\nbuilt squarely on the foundation laid out by Strickland.\nPadilla relied upon controlling precedent. It began by\nreciting the basic rule that “[u]nder Strickland, we first\ndetermine whether counsel’s representation ‘fell below an\nobjective standard of reasonableness.’ ” Padilla, 559 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n688). We recognized that “[t]he first prong—constitutional\ndeficiency—is necessarily linked to the practice and expec­\ntations of the legal community: ‘[t]he proper measure of\n——————\n  2 AEDPA of course differs from the Teague rule in other important\n\nrespects. See, e.g., Greene v. Fisher, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 5). But these differences aside, the fact that we have repeatedly\nfound AEDPA cases involving Strickland to be controlled by established\nprecedent underscores that the application of Strickland in a new\ncontext should almost never result in a new rule.\n4                CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nattorney performance remains reasonableness under pre-\nvailing professional norms.’ ” Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9) (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688).\n   We therefore examined the substantial changes in fed-\neral immigration law that provided the backdrop to the\nrelevant professional standards. Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 2–6). Pursuant to the Immigration Act of\n1917, 39 Stat. 889–890, a judge could recommend that a\ndefendant who had committed a deportable offense not\nbe removed from the country. Congress entirely eliminated\nthis procedure in 1990. 104 Stat. 5050. Then the Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009–596, abolished the Attor-\nney General’s authority to grant discretionary relief from\nremoval for all but a small number of offenses. Padilla,\n559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). These changes in immi­\ngration law meant that for a noncitizen who committed\na removable offense, “removal [had become] practically\ninevitable.” Ibid.\n   In parallel with these developments, the standards of\nprofessional responsibility relating to immigration had\nbecome more demanding. “For at least the past 15 years,”\nwe observed in Padilla, “professional norms have gener-\nally imposed an obligation on counsel to provide advice on\nthe deportation consequences of a client’s plea.” Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 15). Citing an array of practice guides and\nprofessional responsibility manuals, we noted that “[t]he\nweight of prevailing professional norms supports the view\nthat counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of\ndeportation.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). Indeed, “authori­\nties of every stripe—including the American Bar Associa­\ntion, criminal defense and public defender organizations,\nauthoritative treatises, and state and city bar publica­\ntions—universally require defense attorneys to advise as\nto the risk of deportation consequences for non-citizen\nclients.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    5\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nmarks omitted).\n   We drew further support for our conclusion that profes­\nsional standards required advice about deportation conse­\nquences from our decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289\n(2001). See Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(citing St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 323). In St. Cyr, we had\nexplained that the availability of discretionary relief from\nremoval was critical to a noncitizen’s decision to accept a\nplea offer, and expected counsel to follow the instructions\nof “numerous practice guides,” such as the ABA’s Stand­\nards for Criminal Justice, to inform themselves of the\npossible immigration consequences of a plea. Padilla, 559\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (citing St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at\n323, n. 50); see id., at 322, n. 48. And we there found that\nmany States already required that a trial judge advise\ndefendants of the same. Ibid. St. Cyr thus “recognized\nthat ‘preserving the client’s right to remain in the United\nStates may be more important to the client than any\npotential jail sentence.’ ” Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10) (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 322).\n   Our application of Strickland in Padilla followed natu­\nrally from these earlier observations about changes in\nimmigration law and the accompanying evolution of pro­\nfessional norms. When we decided St. Cyr and Padilla,\nnothing about Strickland’s substance or applicability had\nchanged. The only difference from prior law was that\nthe underlying professional norms had changed such that\ncounsel’s failure to give this advice now amounted to\nconstitutionally deficient performance.3 Both before Pa-\n——————\n   3 Even before IIRIRA and St. Cyr, lawyers of course understood that\n\nit was good practice to inform clients of the deportation consequences of\na plea. See ante, at 14, n. 15 (citing 3 ABA Project on Standards for\nCriminal Justice, Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty §3.2(b), Com­\nmentary, p. 71 (App. Draft 1968)). Following the sea change in immi­\ngration law, however, the professional norms had become so established\nand universally recognized that the measure of constitutionally ade­\n6                  CHAIDEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ndilla and after, counsel was obligated to follow the rele­\nvant professional norms. It was only because those norms\nreflected changes in immigration law that Padilla reached\nthe result it did, not because the Sixth Amendment right\nhad changed at all.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   Accepting that routine applications of Strickland do not\nresult in new rules, the majority nevertheless holds that\nPadilla went a step further. In its view, Padilla “ ‘br[oke]\nnew ground’ ” by addressing the threshold question of\nwhether advice about deportation is a collateral conse­\nquence of a criminal conviction that falls within the scope\nof the Sixth Amendment. Ante, at 9–10. But that is\nwrong, because Padilla declined to embrace the very\ndistinction between collateral and direct consequences of a\ncriminal conviction that the majority says it did. In fact,\nthe Court stated very clearly that it found the distinction\nirrelevant for the purposes of determining a defense law­\nyer’s obligation to provide advice about the immigration\nconsequences of a plea. 559 U. S., at ___, n. 8 (slip op.,\nat 7, n. 8). We asserted that we had “never applied a dis­\ntinction between direct and collateral consequences to\ndefine the scope of constitutionally ‘reasonable professional\nassistance’ required under Strickland,” and concluded that\n“[w]hether that distinction is appropriate is a question we\nneed not consider in this case.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8)\n(emphasis added). The distinction was “ill suited” to the\ntask at hand, we explained, because deportation has a\n“close connection to the criminal process,” and is “uniquely\ndifficult to classify as either a direct or a collateral conse­\nquence.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8–9). Indeed, “[o]ur law\n\n—————— \n\nquate performance now included giving such advice in the form Padilla\n\nrecognized. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

With­\nout this revision to our recent decisional history, the ma­\njority’s analysis unravels.\n                              B\n  The majority finds that the “legal landscape,” Graham v.\nCollins, 506 U. S. 461, 468 (1993), before Padilla was\nnearly uniform in its rejection of Strickland’s application\nto the deportation consequences of a plea. Ante, at 7–10.\nIt concludes that the lower courts were generally in\nagreement that the Sixth Amendment did not require\nattorneys to inform clients of the collateral consequences\nof a plea, and that this weighs heavily in favor of finding\nthat Padilla announced a new rule. Ante, at 7–8, nn. 7, 8.\nBut the majority’s discussion of these precedents operates\nat too high a level of generality and fails to account for the\n——————\n   4 See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.

St. Cyr\nnoted the importance of advising clients about immigra­\ntion consequences was of recent vintage, indeed more re-\ncent than some of the cases the majority cites. See 533\nU. S., at 322–323. The Court relies upon decisions issued\nover a period that spans more than 30 years. See ante, at\n7–8, nn. 7, 8. Nearly half of them (17) were decided before\nthe enactment of IIRIRA. See ibid. And all but two of\nthe Federal Court of Appeals cases were decided before St.\nCyr. See ante, at 7–8, nn. 7, 8. These earlier decisions\nshow nothing more than that the underlying professional\nnorms had not yet evolved to require attorneys to provide\nadvice about deportation consequences.\n   Cases from the period following IIRIRA and St. Cyr\nundermine the majority’s generalizations about the state\nof the law before Padilla. Deportation had long been un-\nderstood by lower courts to present “the most difficult”\npenalty to classify as either a collateral or direct conse­\nquence. United States v. Russell, 686 F. 2d 35, 38 (CADC\n1982); cf. Janvier v. United States, 793 F. 2d 449, 455\n(CA2 1986) (holding that Strickland applied to advice\nabout a judicial recommendation against deportation).\nEventually, and in parallel with changes in federal immi­\ngration law and the corresponding professional norms, the\nlower courts had acknowledged an important qualification\nto the collateral consequences rule. After the passage of\nIIRIRA and this Court’s decision in St. Cyr, many courts\nconcluded that a lawyer’s affirmative misstatements about\nthe immigration consequences of a guilty plea can consti­\ntute deficient performance under Strickland. Indeed, each\nFederal Court of Appeals to address the question after St.\nCyr so held. See United States v. Couto, 311 F. 3d 179,\n188 (CA2 2002); United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d 1005,\n1015 (CA9 2005); cf. Downs-Morgan v. United States, 765\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

They also fore­\nshadowed the Court’s reasoning in Padilla by basing their\nanalysis of the relevant professional norms on the special\nnature of deportation, the ABA standards governing im­\nmigration practice, and the Court’s assessment of those\nstandards in St Cyr. See Kwan, 407 F. 3d, at 1016 (“That\ncounsel may have misled [the defendant] out of ignorance\nis no excuse. It is a basic rule of professional conduct that\na lawyer must . . .

Ante, at 12–13. But, as explained, the reasoning of\nthese cases renders that characterization at best incom­\nplete. See, e.g., Kwan, 407 F. 3d, at 1016. While these\nlower court precedents are consistent with the general\nprinciple that attorneys should not mislead clients by\nproviding incorrect advice, they did not rest primarily on\nthat rule. Rather, they recognized the significant changes\nin professional norms that predated Padilla and that we\nhad noted in St. Cyr. As a consequence, the “wall between\ndirect and collateral consequences” that the lower courts\nhad erected, ante, at 9, had already been dealt a serious\nblow by the time the Court decided Padilla.\n   As the majority points out, these misrepresentation\ncases stopped short of imposing an affirmative obligation\non lawyers to consult with clients about the consequences\nof deportation. Ante, at 12–13. But the majority places\ntoo much emphasis on the absence of lower court authority\nfinding that an attorney’s omissions with respect to depor­\ntation resulted in ineffective assistance. The distinction\nbetween omissions and affirmative misrepresentations on\nwhich these lower court cases depended cannot be recon­\nciled with Strickland. In Padilla itself, we rejected the\nSolicitor General’s suggestion that Strickland should\napply to advice about the immigration consequences of a\nplea only in cases where defense counsel makes an affirm­\native misstatement. Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n12). We did so because we found that Strickland was\nincompatible with the distinction between an obligation to\ngive advice and a prohibition on affirmative misstate­\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Strickland made clear that its\nstandard of attorney performance applied to both “acts”\nand “omissions,” and that a rule limiting the performance\ninquiry to one or the other was too narrow. 466 U. S.,\nat 690. Thus, the distinction between misrepresentations\nand omissions, on which the majority relies in classifying\nlower court precedent, implies a categorical rule that is\ninconsistent with Strickland’s requirement of a case-by­\ncase assessment of an attorney’s performance.7 Id., at\n688–689; see, e.g., Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470, 479\n(2000). In short, that some courts have differentiated\nbetween misleading by silence and affirmative misrep-\nresentation hardly establishes the rationality of the dis­\ntinction. Notably, the Court offers no reasoned basis for\nbelieving that such a distinction can be extracted from\nStrickland.\n   To be sure, lower courts did continue to apply the dis­\ntinction between collateral and direct consequences after\nSt. Cyr. See ante, at 13–14; see, e.g., Broomes v. Ashcroft,\n358 F. 3d 1251, 1256–1257 (CA10 2004). Even so, and\neven assuming the misrepresentation cases did not call\nthe distinction into question, the existence of these lower\ncourt decisions is not dispositive. “[T]he standard for\ndetermining when a case establishes a new rule is ‘objec­\ntive,’ and the mere existence of conflicting authority does\n——————\n  7 The majority cites a law review article for the proposition that the\ncategorical consequences rule is “one of ‘the most widely recognized\nrules of American law.’ ” Ante, at 8 (quoting Chin & Holmes, Effective\nAssistance of Counsel and the Consequences of Guilty Pleas, 87 Cornell\nL. Rev. 697, 706 (2002)). But the article was, in fact, quite critical of\nthe rule. The authors explained that “[t]he real work of the conviction\nis performed by the collateral consequences,” and that the direct/\ncollateral distinction in the context of ineffective-assistance claims\nwas “surprising because it seems inconsistent with the framework that\nthe Supreme Court . . . laid out” in Strickland.

S. 461, 506 (1993) (Souter, J., dissenting).\n   Where the application of Strickland was straightfor­\nward, rooted in 15 years of professional standards and the\nCourt’s prior St. Cyr decision, there is no reason to put\nthese lower court cases, many from more than a decade\nearlier, ahead of this Court’s simple and clear reasoning in\nPadilla. Nevertheless, the majority reaches the paradoxi­\ncal conclusion that by declining to apply a collateral­\nconsequence doctrine the Court had never adopted, Pa-\ndilla announced a new rule.\n                              III\n   What truly appears to drive the majority’s analysis is its\nsense that Padilla occasioned a serious disruption in lower\ncourt decisional reasoning. See, e.g., ante, at 9–10 (“If that\ndoes not count as ‘break[ing] new ground’ . . . we are hard\npressed to know what would” (quoting Teague, 489 U. S.,\nat 301)). The concurring and dissenting opinions in Pa-\ndilla similarly reflected the impression that it was a sig­\nnificant and destabilizing decision. See 559 U. S., at ___\n(ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3); id., at\n___ (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5) (describing the\nmajority opinion as a “sledge hammer”); ante, at 8–9, n.\n10. But the fact that a decision was perceived as momen­\ntous or consequential, particularly by those who disagreed\nwith it, does not control in the Teague analysis. Faithfully\napplying the Teague rule depends instead on an examina­\ntion of this Court’s reasoning and an objective assessment\nof the precedent at issue. Stringer, 503 U. S., at 237. In\nPadilla, we did nothing more than apply Strickland.
