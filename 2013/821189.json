UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                No. 12–6142.

It should\nnot.\n   Petitioner Bongani Charles Calhoun stood trial in a\nfederal court in Texas for participating in a drug conspir-\nacy. The primary issue was whether Calhoun knew that\nthe friend he had accompanied on a road trip, along with\nthe friend’s associates, were about to engage in a drug\ntransaction, or whether instead Calhoun was merely\npresent during the group’s drive home, when the others\nattempted to purchase cocaine from undercover Drug\nEnforcement Agency (DEA) agents. Two alleged co-\nconspirators who had pleaded guilty testified to Calhoun’s\nknowledge. Law enforcement officers also testified that\nthey discussed the drugs with Calhoun immediately before\nthey broke cover to arrest the group, and that Calhoun\nhad a gun when he was arrested. In his defense, Calhoun\ntestified that he was not part of and had no knowledge of\nhis friend’s plan to purchase drugs, that he did not under-\nstand the DEA agents when they spoke to him in Spanish\nonly, and that he always carried a concealed firearm, as he\n2                CALHOUN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nwas licensed to do. It was up to the jurors to decide whom\nthey believed.\n   The issue of Calhoun’s intent came to a head when the pros-\necutor cross-examined him. Calhoun related that the\nnight before the arrest, he had detached himself from the\ngroup when his friend arrived at their hotel room with a\nbag of money. He stated that he “didn’t know” what was\nhappening, and that it “made me think . . . [t]hat I didn’t\nwant to be there.” Tr. 125–126 (Mar. 8, 2011). (Calhoun\nhad previously testified that he rejoined the group the\nnext morning because he thought they were finally return-\ning home. Id., at 109.) The prosecutor pressed Calhoun\nrepeatedly to explain why he did not want to be in the\nhotel room. Eventually, the District Judge told the prose-\ncutor to move on. That is when the prosecutor asked,\n“You’ve got African-Americans, you’ve got Hispanics,\nyou’ve got a bag full of money. Does that tell you—a light bulb\ndoesn’t go off in your head and say, This is a drug deal?”\nId., at 127.\n   Calhoun, who is African-American, claims that the\nprosecutor’s racially charged question violated his consti-\ntutional rights. Inexplicably, however, Calhoun’s counsel\ndid not object to the question at trial. So Calhoun’s chal-\nlenge comes to us on plain-error review, under which he\nwould ordinarily have to “demonstrate that [the error]\n‘affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.’ ”\nPuckett v. United States, 556 U. S. 129, 135 (2009) (quot-\ning United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 734 (1993)). Yet\nin his petition for writ of certiorari, Calhoun does not\nattempt to make that showing. Instead, Calhoun contends\nthat the comment should lead to automatic reversal be-\ncause it constitutes either structural error or plain error\nregardless of whether it prejudiced the outcome. Those\narguments, however, were forfeited when Calhoun failed\nto press them on appeal to the Fifth Circuit.

Kemp, 481 U. S. 279, 309, n. 30 (1987). Such argu-\nmentation is an affront to the Constitution’s guarantee\nof equal protection of the laws. And by threatening to\ncultivate bias in the jury, it equally offends the de-\nfendant’s right to an impartial jury. Judge Frank put the\npoint well: “If government counsel in a criminal suit is\nallowed to inflame the jurors by irrelevantly arousing\ntheir deepest prejudices, the jury may become in his hands\na lethal weapon directed against defendants who may be\ninnocent. He should not be permitted to summon that\nthirteenth juror, prejudice.” United States v. Antonelli\nFireworks Co., 155 F. 2d 631, 659 (CA2 1946) (dissenting\nopinion) (footnote omitted).

But there’s one element that’s\nmissing. The money. So what are they doing in this room with a bag\nfull of money? What does your common sense tell you that these people\nare doing in a hotel room with a bag full of money, cash? None of these\npeople are Bill Gates or computer [magnates]?
