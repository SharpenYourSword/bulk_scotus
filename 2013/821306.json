AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n No. 11–1025. Argued October 29, 2012—Decided February 26, 2013\nSection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA),\n  50 U. S. C. §1881a, added by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008,\n  permits the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelli-\n  gence to acquire foreign intelligence information by jointly authoriz-\n  ing the surveillance of individuals who are not “United States per-\n  sons” and are reasonably believed to be located outside the United\n  States. Before doing so, the Attorney General and the Director of Na-\n  tional Intelligence normally must obtain the Foreign Intelligence\n  Surveillance Court’s (FISC) approval. Surveillance under §1881a is\n  subject to statutory conditions, judicial authorization, congressional\n  supervision, and compliance with the Fourth Amendment. Respond-\n  ents—attorneys and human rights, labor, legal, and media organiza-\n  tions—are United States persons who claim that they engage in sen-\n  sitive international communications with individuals who they\n  believe are likely targets of §1881a surveillance. On the day that the\n  FISA Amendments Act was enacted, they filed suit, seeking a decla-\n  ration that §1881a is facially unconstitutional and a permanent in-\n  junction against §1881a-authorized surveillance. The District Court\n  found that respondents lacked standing, but the Second Circuit re-\n  versed, holding that respondents showed (1) an “objectively reasona-\n  ble likelihood” that their communications will be intercepted at some\n  time in the future, and (2) that they are suffering present injuries re-\n  sulting from costly and burdensome measures they take to protect\n  the confidentiality of their international communications from possi-\n  ble §1881a surveillance.\nHeld: Respondents do not have Article III standing. Pp. 8–24.\n    (a) To establish Article III standing, an injury must be “concrete,\n2            CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the chal-\n    lenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.” Monsanto Co.\n    v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U. S. ___, ___. “[T]hreatened injury\n    must be ‘ “certainly impending” ’ to constitute injury in fact,” and\n    “[a]llegations of possible future injury” are not sufficient. Whitmore\n    v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 158. Pp. 8–10.\n       (b) Respondents assert that they have suffered injury in fact that is\n    fairly traceable to §1881a because there is an objectively reasonable\n    likelihood that their communications with their foreign contacts will\n    be intercepted under §1881a at some point. This argument fails. Ini-\n    tially, the Second Circuit’s “objectively reasonable likelihood” stand-\n    ard is inconsistent with this Court’s “threatened injury” requirement.\n    Respondents’ standing theory also rests on a speculative chain of pos-\n    sibilities that does not establish that their potential injury is certain-\n    ly impending or is fairly traceable to §1881a. First, it is highly specu-\n    lative whether the Government will imminently target\n    communications to which respondents are parties. Since respond-\n    ents, as U. S. persons, cannot be targeted under §1881a, their theory\n    necessarily rests on their assertion that their foreign contacts will be\n    targeted. Yet they have no actual knowledge of the Government’s\n    §1881a targeting practices. Second, even if respondents could\n    demonstrate that the targeting of their foreign contacts is imminent,\n    they can only speculate as to whether the Government will seek to\n    use §1881a-authorized surveillance instead of one of the Govern-\n    ment’s numerous other surveillance methods, which are not chal-\n    lenged here. Third, even if respondents could show that the Govern-\n    ment will seek FISC authorization to target respondents’ foreign\n    contacts under §1881a, they can only speculate as to whether the\n    FISC will authorize the surveillance. This Court is reluctant to en-\n    dorse standing theories that require guesswork as to how independ-\n    ent decisionmakers will exercise their judgment. See, e.g., Whitmore,\n    supra, at 159–160. Fourth, even if the Government were to obtain\n    the FISC’s approval to target respondents’ foreign contacts under\n    §1881a, it is unclear whether the Government would succeed in ac-\n    quiring those contacts’ communications. And fifth, even if the Gov-\n    ernment were to target respondents’ foreign contacts, respondents\n    can only speculate as to whether their own communications with\n    those contacts would be incidentally acquired. Pp. 10–15.\n       (c) Respondents’ alternative argument is also unpersuasive. They\n    claim that they suffer ongoing injuries that are fairly traceable to\n    §1881a because the risk of §1881a surveillance requires them to take\n    costly and burdensome measures to protect the confidentiality of\n    their communications. But respondents cannot manufacture stand-\n    ing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  harm that is not certainly impending. Because they do not face a\n  threat of certainly impending interception under §1881a, their costs\n  are simply the product of their fear of surveillance, which is insuffi-\n  cient to create standing. See Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 10–15. Ac-\n  cordingly, any ongoing injuries that respondents are suffering are not\n  fairly traceable to §1881a. Pp. 16–20.\n    (d) Respondents’ remaining arguments are likewise unavailing.\n  Contrary to their claim, their alleged injuries are not the same kinds\n  of injuries that supported standing in cases such as Friends of the\n  Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S.\n  167, Meese v. Keene, 481 U. S. 465, and Monsanto, supra. And their\n  suggestion that they should be held to have standing because other-\n  wise the constitutionality of §1881a will never be adjudicated is both\n  legally and factually incorrect. First, “ ‘[t]he assumption that if re-\n  spondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is\n  not a reason to find standing.’ ” Valley Forge Christian College v.\n  Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S.\n  464, 489. Second, the holding in this case by no means insulates\n  §1881a from judicial review.

S. C. §1881a (2006 ed., Supp. V), allows the\nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence\nto acquire foreign intelligence information by jointly au-\nthorizing the surveillance of individuals who are not\n“United States persons”1 and are reasonably believed to be\nlocated outside the United States. Before doing so, the\nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence\nnormally must obtain the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-\nlance Court’s approval. Respondents are United States\npersons whose work, they allege, requires them to engage\nin sensitive international communications with individ-\nuals who they believe are likely targets of surveillance\nunder §1881a.      Respondents seek a declaration that\n§1881a is unconstitutional, as well as an injunction\nagainst §1881a-authorized surveillance. The question\n——————\n   1 The term “United States person” includes citizens of the United\n\nStates, aliens admitted for permanent residence, and certain associa-\ntions and corporations. 50 U. S. C. §1801(i); see §1881(a).\n2        CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore us is whether respondents have Article III standing\nto seek this prospective relief.\n  Respondents assert that they can establish injury in fact\nbecause there is an objectively reasonable likelihood that\ntheir communications will be acquired under §1881a at\nsome point in the future. But respondents’ theory of fu-\nture injury is too speculative to satisfy the well-established\nrequirement that threatened injury must be “certainly\nimpending.” E.g., Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149,\n158 (1990). And even if respondents could demonstrate\nthat the threatened injury is certainly impending, they\nstill would not be able to establish that this injury is fairly\ntraceable to §1881a. As an alternative argument, re-\nspondents contend that they are suffering present injury\nbecause the risk of §1881a-authorized surveillance al-\nready has forced them to take costly and burdensome meas-\nures to protect the confidentiality of their international\ncommunications. But respondents cannot manufacture stand-\ning by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothet-\nical future harm that is not certainly impending. We\ntherefore hold that respondents lack Article III standing.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  In 1978, after years of debate, Congress enacted the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to authorize\nand regulate certain governmental electronic surveillance\nof communications for foreign intelligence purposes. See\n92 Stat. 1783, 50 U. S. C. §1801 et seq.; 1 D. Kris & J.\nWilson, National Security Investigations & Prosecutions\n§§3.1, 3.7 (2d ed. 2012) (hereinafter Kris & Wilson). In\nenacting FISA, Congress legislated against the backdrop\nof our decision in United States v. United States Dist.\nCourt for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407 U. S. 297 (1972)\n(Keith), in which we explained that the standards and\nprocedures that law enforcement officials must follow\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen conducting “surveillance of ‘ordinary crime’ ” might\nnot be required in the context of surveillance conducted\nfor domestic national-security purposes. Id., at 322–323.\nAlthough the Keith opinion expressly disclaimed any\nruling “on the scope of the President’s surveillance power\nwith respect to the activities of foreign powers,” id., at 308,\nit implicitly suggested that a special framework for foreign\nintelligence surveillance might be constitutionally permis-\nsible, see id., at 322–323.\n   In constructing such a framework for foreign intel-\nligence surveillance, Congress created two specialized\ncourts. In FISA, Congress authorized judges of the For-\neign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to approve\nelectronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes if\nthere is probable cause to believe that “the target of the\nelectronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a\nforeign power,” and that each of the specific “facilities or\nplaces at which the electronic surveillance is directed is\nbeing used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an\nagent of a foreign power.” §105(a)(3), 92 Stat. 1790; see\n§§105(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), ibid.; 1 Kris & Wilson §7:2, at\n194–195; id., §16:2, at 528–529. Additionally, Congress\nvested the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of\nReview with jurisdiction to review any denials by the\nFISC of applications for electronic surveillance. §103(b),\n92 Stat. 1788; 1 Kris & Wilson §5:7, at 151–153.\n   In the wake of the September 11th attacks, President\nGeorge W. Bush authorized the National Security Agency\n(NSA) to conduct warrantless wiretapping of telephone\nand e-mail communications where one party to the com-\nmunication was located outside the United States and a\nparticipant in “the call was reasonably believed to be a\nmember or agent of al Qaeda or an affiliated terrorist\norganization,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 403a. See id., at\n263a–265a, 268a, 273a–279a, 292a–293a; American Civil\nLiberties Union v. NSA, 493 F. 3d 644, 648 (CA6 2007)\n4        CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(ACLU) (opinion of Batchelder, J.). In January 2007, the\nFISC issued orders authorizing the Government to target\ninternational communications into or out of the United\nStates where there was probable cause to believe that one\nparticipant to the communication was a member or agent\nof al Qaeda or an associated terrorist organization. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 312a, 398a, 405a. These FISC orders sub-\njected any electronic surveillance that was then occur-\nring under the NSA’s program to the approval of the FISC.\nId., at 405a; see id., at 312a, 404a. After a FISC Judge\nsubsequently narrowed the FISC’s authorization of such\nsurveillance, however, the Executive asked Congress to\namend FISA so that it would provide the intelligence\ncommunity with additional authority to meet the chal-\nlenges of modern technology and international terrorism.\nId., at 315a–318a, 331a–333a, 398a; see id., at 262a,\n277a–279a, 287a.\n  When Congress enacted the FISA Amendments Act of\n2008 (FISA Amendments Act), 122 Stat. 2436, it left much\nof FISA intact, but it “established a new and independent\nsource of intelligence collection authority, beyond that\ngranted in traditional FISA.” 1 Kris & Wilson §9:11, at\n349–350. As relevant here, §702 of FISA, 50 U. S. C.\n§1881a (2006 ed., Supp. V), which was enacted as part\nof the FISA Amendments Act, supplements pre-existing\nFISA authority by creating a new framework under which\nthe Government may seek the FISC’s authorization of\ncertain foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the\ncommunications of non-U. S. persons located abroad.\nUnlike traditional FISA surveillance, §1881a does not\nrequire the Government to demonstrate probable cause\nthat the target of the electronic surveillance is a for-\neign power or agent of a foreign power.              Compare\n§§1805(a)(2)(A), (a)(2)(B), with §§1881a(d)(1), (i)(3)(A); 638\nF. 3d 118, 126 (CA2 2011); 1 Kris & Wilson §16:16, at 584.\nAnd, unlike traditional FISA, §1881a does not require the\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

Compare §§1805(a)(2)(B), (c)(1)\n(2006 ed. and Supp. V), with §§1881a(d)(1), (g)(4), (i)(3)(A);\n638 F. 3d, at 125–126; 1 Kris & Wilson §16:16, at 585.2\n   The present case involves a constitutional challenge to\n§1881a. Surveillance under §1881a is subject to statutory\nconditions, judicial authorization, congressional supervi-\nsion, and compliance with the Fourth Amendment. Sec-\ntion 1881a provides that, upon the issuance of an order\nfrom the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, “the\nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence\nmay authorize jointly, for a period of up to 1 year . . . , the\ntargeting of persons reasonably believed to be located\noutside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence\ninformation.” §1881a(a). Surveillance under §1881a may\nnot be intentionally targeted at any person known to be in\nthe United States or any U. S. person reasonably believed\nto be located abroad. §§1881a(b)(1)–(3); see also §1801(i).\nAdditionally, acquisitions under §1881a must comport\nwith the Fourth Amendment. §1881a(b)(5). Moreover,\nsurveillance under §1881a is subject to congressional\noversight and several types of Executive Branch review.\nSee §§1881a(f)(2), (l); Amnesty Int’l USA v.

Among other things,\nthe Government’s certification must attest that (1) pro-\ncedures are in place “that have been approved, have\nbeen submitted for approval, or will be submitted with the\n——————\n  2 Congress recently reauthorized the FISA Amendments Act for an-\n\nother five years.

Additionally, the\nCourt assesses whether the targeting procedures are\n“reasonably designed” (1) to “ensure that an acquisition\n. . . is limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to\nbe located outside the United States” and (2) to “prevent\nthe intentional acquisition of any communication as to\nwhich the sender and all intended recipients are known\n. . . to be located in the United States.” §1881a(i)(2)(B).\nThe Court analyzes whether the minimization procedures\n“meet the definition of minimization procedures under\nsection 1801(h) . . . , as appropriate.” §1881a(i)(2)(C). The\nCourt also assesses whether the targeting and minimiza-\ntion procedures are consistent with the statute and the\nFourth Amendment. See §1881a(i)(3)(A).3\n\n\n\n——————\n  3 The dissent attempts to downplay the safeguards established by\n\n§1881a. See post, at 4 (opinion of BREYER, J.). Notably, the dissent\ndoes not directly acknowledge that §1881a surveillance must comport\nwith the Fourth Amendment, see §1881a(b)(5), and that the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court must assess whether targeting and\nminimization procedures are consistent with the Fourth Amendment,\nsee §1881a(i)(3)(A).\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Respondents believe that some of the people with\nwhom they exchange foreign intelligence information are\nlikely targets of surveillance under §1881a. Specifically,\nrespondents claim that they communicate by telephone\nand e-mail with people the Government “believes or be-\nlieved to be associated with terrorist organizations,” “peo-\nple located in geographic areas that are a special focus” of\nthe Government’s counterterrorism or diplomatic efforts,\nand activists who oppose governments that are supported\nby the United States Government. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n399a.\n   Respondents claim that §1881a compromises their\nability to locate witnesses, cultivate sources, obtain infor-\nmation, and communicate confidential information to their\nclients. Respondents also assert that they “have ceased\nengaging” in certain telephone and e-mail conversations.\nId., at 400a. According to respondents, the threat of sur-\nveillance will compel them to travel abroad in order to\nhave in-person conversations. In addition, respondents\ndeclare that they have undertaken “costly and burden-\nsome measures” to protect the confidentiality of sensitive\ncommunications. Ibid.\n                              C\n  On the day when the FISA Amendments Act was en-\nacted, respondents filed this action seeking (1) a declaration\nthat §1881a, on its face, violates the Fourth Amendment,\nthe First Amendment, Article III, and separation-of-\npowers principles and (2) a permanent injunction against\nthe use of §1881a. Respondents assert what they charac-\n8        CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nterize as two separate theories of Article III standing.\nFirst, they claim that there is an objectively reasonable\nlikelihood that their communications will be acquired\nunder §1881a at some point in the future, thus causing\nthem injury. Second, respondents maintain that the risk\nof surveillance under §1881a is so substantial that they\nhave been forced to take costly and burdensome measures\nto protect the confidentiality of their international com-\nmunications; in their view, the costs they have incurred\nconstitute present injury that is fairly traceable to §1881a.\n   After both parties moved for summary judgment, the\nDistrict Court held that respondents do not have standing.\nMcConnell, 646 F. Supp. 2d, at 635. On appeal, however,\na panel of the Second Circuit reversed. The panel agreed\nwith respondents’ argument that they have standing due\nto the objectively reasonable likelihood that their commu-\nnications will be intercepted at some time in the future.\n638 F. 3d, at 133, 134, 139. In addition, the panel held\nthat respondents have established that they are suffering\n“present injuries in fact—economic and professional\nharms—stemming from a reasonable fear of future harm-\nful government conduct.” Id., at 138.

Furthermore, respondents’ argument rests on their\nhighly speculative fear that: (1) the Government will\ndecide to target the communications of non-U. S. persons\nwith whom they communicate; (2) in doing so, the Gov-\nernment will choose to invoke its authority under §1881a\nrather than utilizing another method of surveillance;\n(3) the Article III judges who serve on the Foreign Intelli-\ngence Surveillance Court will conclude that the Govern-\nment’s proposed surveillance procedures satisfy §1881a’s\nmany safeguards and are consistent with the Fourth\nAmendment; (4) the Government will succeed in inter-\ncepting the communications of respondents’ contacts; and\n(5) respondents will be parties to the particular communi-\ncations that the Government intercepts. As discussed\nbelow, respondents’ theory of standing, which relies on a\nhighly attenuated chain of possibilities, does not satisfy\nthe requirement that threatened injury must be certainly\nimpending. See Summers, supra, at 496 (rejecting a\nstanding theory premised on a speculative chain of possi-\nbilities); Whitmore, supra, at 157–160 (same). Moreover,\neven if respondents could demonstrate injury in fact, the\nsecond link in the above-described chain of contingen-\ncies—which amounts to mere speculation about whether\nsurveillance would be under §1881a or some other author-\nity—shows that respondents cannot satisfy the require-\nment that any injury in fact must be fairly traceable to\n§1881a.\n   First, it is speculative whether the Government will\nimminently target communications to which respondents\nare parties. Section 1881a expressly provides that re-\nspondents, who are U. S. persons, cannot be targeted for\n12       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsurveillance under §1881a. See §§1881a(b)(1)–(3); 667\nF. 3d, at 173 (Raggi, J., dissenting from denial of rehear-\ning en banc). Accordingly, it is no surprise that respond-\nents fail to offer any evidence that their communications\nhave been monitored under §1881a, a failure that sub-\nstantially undermines their standing theory. See ACLU,\n493 F. 3d, at 655–656, 673–674 (opinion of Batchelder, J.)\n(concluding that plaintiffs who lacked evidence that their\ncommunications had been intercepted did not have stand-\ning to challenge alleged NSA surveillance). Indeed, re-\nspondents do not even allege that the Government has\nsought the FISC’s approval for surveillance of their com-\nmunications. Accordingly, respondents’ theory necessarily\nrests on their assertion that the Government will target\nother individuals—namely, their foreign contacts.\n   Yet respondents have no actual knowledge of the\nGovernment’s §1881a targeting practices. Instead, re-\nspondents merely speculate and make assumptions about\nwhether their communications with their foreign contacts\nwill be acquired under §1881a. See 667 F. 3d, at 185–187\n(opinion of Raggi, J.). For example, journalist Christopher\nHedges states: “I have no choice but to assume that any of\nmy international communications may be subject to gov-\nernment surveillance, and I have to make decisions . . . in\nlight of that assumption.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 366a\n(emphasis added and deleted). Similarly, attorney Scott\nMcKay asserts that, “[b]ecause of the [FISA Amendments\nAct], we now have to assume that every one of our interna-\ntional communications may be monitored by the govern-\nment.” Id., at 375a (emphasis added); see also id., at 337a,\n343a–344a, 350a, 356a. “The party invoking federal juris-\ndiction bears the burden of establishing” standing—and,\nat the summary judgment stage, such a party “can no\nlonger rest on . . . ‘mere allegations,’ but must ‘set forth’ by\naffidavit or other evidence ‘specific facts.’ ” Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U. S., at 561. Respondents, however, have\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nset forth no specific facts demonstrating that the commu-\nnications of their foreign contacts will be targeted. More-\nover, because §1881a at most authorizes—but does not\nmandate or direct—the surveillance that respondents fear,\nrespondents’ allegations are necessarily conjectural. See\nUnited Presbyterian Church in U. S. A. v. Reagan, 738\nF. 2d 1375, 1380 (CADC 1984) (Scalia, J.); 667 F. 3d, at\n187 (opinion of Raggi, J.). Simply put, respondents can\nonly speculate as to how the Attorney General and the\nDirector of National Intelligence will exercise their discre-\ntion in determining which communications to target.4\n   Second, even if respondents could demonstrate that the\ntargeting of their foreign contacts is imminent, respond-\nents can only speculate as to whether the Government will\nseek to use §1881a-authorized surveillance (rather than\nother methods) to do so. The Government has numerous\nother methods of conducting surveillance, none of which is\nchallenged here. Even after the enactment of the FISA\nAmendments Act, for example, the Government may still\nconduct electronic surveillance of persons abroad under\nthe older provisions of FISA so long as it satisfies the\n——————\n   4 It was suggested at oral argument that the Government could help\n\nresolve the standing inquiry by disclosing to a court, perhaps through\nan in camera proceeding, (1) whether it is intercepting respondents’\ncommunications and (2) what targeting or minimization procedures it\nis using. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13–14, 44, 56. This suggestion is puz-\nzling. As an initial matter, it is respondents’ burden to prove their\nstanding by pointing to specific facts, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U. S. 555, 561 (1992), not the Government’s burden to disprove\nstanding by revealing details of its surveillance priorities. Moreover,\nthis type of hypothetical disclosure proceeding would allow a terrorist\n(or his attorney) to determine whether he is currently under U. S.\nsurveillance simply by filing a lawsuit challenging the Government’s\nsurveillance program. Even if the terrorist’s attorney were to comply\nwith a protective order prohibiting him from sharing the Government’s\ndisclosures with his client, the court’s postdisclosure decision about\nwhether to dismiss the suit for lack of standing would surely signal to\nthe terrorist whether his name was on the list of surveillance targets.\n14       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\napplicable requirements, including a demonstration of\nprobable cause to believe that the person is a foreign\npower or agent of a foreign power. See §1805. The Gov-\nernment may also obtain information from the intelligence\nservices of foreign nations. Brief for Petitioners 33. And,\nalthough we do not reach the question, the Government\ncontends that it can conduct FISA-exempt human and\ntechnical surveillance programs that are governed by\nExecutive Order 12333. See Exec. Order No. 12333, §§1.4,\n2.1–2.5, 3 CFR 202, 210–212 (1981), reprinted as amended,\nnote following 50 U. S. C. §401, pp. 543, 547–548. Even\nif respondents could demonstrate that their foreign\ncontacts will imminently be targeted—indeed, even if they\ncould show that interception of their own communications\nwill imminently occur—they would still need to show\nthat their injury is fairly traceable to §1881a. But, be-\ncause respondents can only speculate as to whether any\n(asserted) interception would be under §1881a or some\nother authority, they cannot satisfy the “fairly traceable”\nrequirement.\n  Third, even if respondents could show that the Govern-\nment will seek the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nCourt’s authorization to acquire the communications of\nrespondents’ foreign contacts under §1881a, respondents\ncan only speculate as to whether that court will authorize\nsuch surveillance. In the past, we have been reluctant to\nendorse standing theories that require guesswork as to\nhow independent decisionmakers will exercise their judg-\nment. In Whitmore, for example, the plaintiff ’s theory of\nstanding hinged largely on the probability that he would\nobtain federal habeas relief and be convicted upon retrial.\nIn holding that the plaintiff lacked standing, we explained\nthat “[i]t is just not possible for a litigant to prove in ad-\nvance that the judicial system will lead to any particular\nresult in his case.” 495 U. S., at 159–160; see Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U. S., at 562.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   We decline to abandon our usual reluctance to endorse\nstanding theories that rest on speculation about the deci-\nsions of independent actors. Section 1881a mandates that\nthe Government must obtain the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Court’s approval of targeting procedures,\nminimization procedures, and a governmental certification\nregarding proposed surveillance. §§1881a(a), (c)(1), (i)(2),\n(i)(3). The Court must, for example, determine whether\nthe Government’s procedures are “reasonably designed . . .\nto minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the\ndissemination, of nonpublicly available information con-\ncerning unconsenting United States persons.” §1801(h);\nsee §§1881a(i)(2), (i)(3)(A). And, critically, the Court must\nalso assess whether the Government’s targeting and\nminimization procedures comport with the Fourth Amend-\nment. §1881a(i)(3)(A).\n   Fourth, even if the Government were to obtain the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s approval to tar-\nget respondents’ foreign contacts under §1881a, it is\nunclear whether the Government would succeed in acquir-\ning the communications of respondents’ foreign contacts.\nAnd fifth, even if the Government were to conduct surveil-\nlance of respondents’ foreign contacts, respondents can\nonly speculate as to whether their own communications\nwith their foreign contacts would be incidentally acquired.\n   In sum, respondents’ speculative chain of possibilities\ndoes not establish that injury based on potential future\nsurveillance is certainly impending or is fairly traceable to\n§1881a.5\n——————\n  5 Our cases do not uniformly require plaintiffs to demonstrate that it\n\nis literally certain that the harms they identify will come about. In\nsome instances, we have found standing based on a “substantial risk”\nthat the harm will occur, which may prompt plaintiffs to reasonably\nincur costs to mitigate or avoid that harm. Monsanto Co. v. Geertson\nSeed Farms, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 11–12). See also\nPennell v. City of San Jose, 485 U. S. 1, 8 (1988); Blum v. Yaretsky, 457\n16         CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n  Respondents’ alternative argument—namely, that they\ncan establish standing based on the measures that they\nhave undertaken to avoid §1881a-authorized surveil-\nlance—fares no better. Respondents assert that they are\nsuffering ongoing injuries that are fairly traceable to\n§1881a because the risk of surveillance under §1881a\nrequires them to take costly and burdensome measures to\nprotect the confidentiality of their communications. Re-\nspondents claim, for instance, that the threat of surveil-\nlance sometimes compels them to avoid certain e-mail and\nphone conversations, to “tal[k] in generalities rather than\nspecifics,” or to travel so that they can have in-person\nconversations. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38; App. to Pet. for Cert.\n338a, 345a, 367a, 400a.6 The Second Circuit panel con-\ncluded that, because respondents are already suffering\nsuch ongoing injuries, the likelihood of interception under\n§1881a is relevant only to the question whether respond-\nents’ ongoing injuries are “fairly traceable” to §1881a. See\n——————\nU. S. 991, 1000–1001 (1982); Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289,\n298 (1979). But to the extent that the “substantial risk” standard is\nrelevant and is distinct from the “clearly impending” requirement,\nrespondents fall short of even that standard, in light of the attenuated\nchain of inferences necessary to find harm here. See supra, at 11–15.\nIn addition, plaintiffs bear the burden of pleading and proving concrete\nfacts showing that the defendant’s actual action has caused the sub-\nstantial risk of harm. Plaintiffs cannot rely on speculation about “ ‘the\nunfettered choices made by independent actors not before the court.’ ”\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 562.\n   6 For all the focus on respondents’ supposed need to travel abroad in\n\nlight of potential §1881a surveillance, respondents cite only one specific\ninstance of travel: an attorney’s trip to New York City to meet with\nother lawyers. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 352a. This domestic travel\nhad but a tenuous connection to §1881a, because §1881a-authorized\nacquisitions “may not intentionally target any person known at the\ntime of acquisition to be located in the United States.” §1881a(b)(1); see\nalso 667 F. 3d 163, 202 (CA2 2011) (Jacobs, C. J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc); id., at 185 (opinion of Raggi, J. (same)).\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n638 F. 3d, at 133–134; 667 F. 3d, at 180 (opinion of Raggi,\nJ.). Analyzing the “fairly traceable” element of standing\nunder a relaxed reasonableness standard, see 638 F. 3d, at\n133–134, the Second Circuit then held that “plaintiffs\nhave established that they suffered present injuries in\nfact—economic and professional harms—stemming from a\nreasonable fear of future harmful government conduct,”\nid., at 138.\n   The Second Circuit’s analysis improperly allowed re-\nspondents to establish standing by asserting that they\nsuffer present costs and burdens that are based on a fear\nof surveillance, so long as that fear is not “fanciful, para-\nnoid, or otherwise unreasonable.” See id., at 134. This\nimproperly waters down the fundamental requirements of\nArticle III. Respondents’ contention that they have stand-\ning because they incurred certain costs as a reasonable\nreaction to a risk of harm is unavailing—because the harm\nrespondents seek to avoid is not certainly impending. In\nother words, respondents cannot manufacture standing\nmerely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their\nfears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly\nimpending. See Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U. S.\n660, 664 (1976) (per curiam); National Family Planning &\nReproductive Health Assn., Inc., 468 F. 3d 826, 831 (CADC\n2006). Any ongoing injuries that respondents are suffer-\ning are not fairly traceable to §1881a.\n   If the law were otherwise, an enterprising plaintiff\nwould be able to secure a lower standard for Article III\nstanding simply by making an expenditure based on a\nnonparanoid fear. As Judge Raggi accurately noted, under\nthe Second Circuit panel’s reasoning, respondents could,\n“for the price of a plane ticket, . . . transform their stand-\ning burden from one requiring a showing of actual or\nimminent . . . interception to one requiring a showing that\ntheir subjective fear of such interception is not fanciful,\nirrational, or clearly unreasonable.” 667 F. 3d, at 180\n18         CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, allowing re-\nspondents to bring this action based on costs they incurred\nin response to a speculative threat would be tantamount\nto accepting a repackaged version of respondents’ first\nfailed theory of standing. See ACLU, 493 F. 3d, at 656–\n657 (opinion of Batchelder, J.).\n   Another reason that respondents’ present injuries are\nnot fairly traceable to §1881a is that even before §1881a\nwas enacted, they had a similar incentive to engage in\nmany of the countermeasures that they are now taking.\nSee id., at 668–670. For instance, respondent Scott\nMcKay’s declaration describes—and the dissent heavily\nrelies on—Mr. McKay’s “knowledge” that thousands of\ncommunications involving one of his clients were moni-\ntored in the past. App. to Pet. for Cert. 370a; post, at 4,\n7–8. But this surveillance was conducted pursuant to FISA\nauthority that predated §1881a. See Brief for Petitioners\n32, n. 11; Al-Kidd v. Gonzales, No. 05–cv–93, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">5123009</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D Idaho, Dec. 4, 2008). Thus, because the Gov-\nernment was allegedly conducting surveillance of Mr.\nMcKay’s client before Congress enacted §1881a, it is diffi-\ncult to see how the safeguards that Mr. McKay now claims\nto have implemented can be traced to §1881a.\n   Because respondents do not face a threat of certainly\nimpending interception under §1881a, the costs that they\nhave incurred to avoid surveillance are simply the product\nof their fear of surveillance,7 and our decision in Laird\n\n——————\n  7 Although respondents’ alternative theory of standing rests primarily\n\non choices that they have made based on their subjective fear of surveil-\nlance, respondents also assert that third parties might be disinclined to\nspeak with them due to a fear of surveillance. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n372a–373a, 352a–353a. To the extent that such assertions are based on\nanything other than conjecture, see Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at\n560, they do not establish injury that is fairly traceable to §1881a,\nbecause they are based on third parties’ subjective fear of surveillance,\nsee Laird, 408 U. S., at 10–14.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmakes it clear that such a fear is insufficient to create\nstanding. See 408 U. S., at 10–15. The plaintiffs in Laird\nargued that their exercise of First Amendment rights was\nbeing “chilled by the mere existence, without more, of [the\nArmy’s] investigative and data-gathering activity.” Id., at\n10. While acknowledging that prior cases had held that\nconstitutional violations may arise from the chilling\neffect of “regulations that fall short of a direct prohibi-\ntion against the exercise of First Amendment rights,” the\nCourt declared that none of those cases involved a\n“chilling effect aris[ing] merely from the individual’s\nknowledge that a governmental agency was engaged in\ncertain activities or from the individual’s concomitant fear\nthat, armed with the fruits of those activities, the agency\nmight in the future take some other and additional action\ndetrimental to that individual.” Id., at 11. Because\n“[a]llegations of a subjective ‘chill’ are not an adequate\nsubstitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or\na threat of specific future harm,” id., at 13–14, the plain-\ntiffs in Laird—and respondents here—lack standing. See\nibid.; ACLU, supra, at 661–662 (opinion of Batchelder, J.)\n(holding that plaintiffs lacked standing because they\n“allege[d] only a subjective apprehension” of alleged NSA\nsurveillance and “a personal (self-imposed) unwillingness\nto communicate”); United Presbyterian Church, 738 F. 2d,\nat 1378 (holding that plaintiffs lacked standing to chal-\nlenge the legality of an Executive Order relating to sur-\nveillance because “the ‘chilling effect’ which is produced by\ntheir fear of being subjected to illegal surveillance and\nwhich deters them from conducting constitutionally pro-\ntected activities, is foreclosed as a basis for standing” by\nLaird).\n   For the reasons discussed above, respondents’ self-\ninflicted injuries are not fairly traceable to the Govern-\nment’s purported activities under §1881a, and their\nsubjective fear of surveillance does not give rise to standing.\n20       CLAPPER v.

Keene, 481 U. S. 465 (1987), and Monsanto. Brief for\nRespondents 24. As an initial matter, none of these cases\nholds or even suggests that plaintiffs can establish stand-\ning simply by claiming that they experienced a “chilling\neffect” that resulted from a governmental policy that does\nnot regulate, constrain, or compel any action on their part.\nMoreover, each of these cases was very different from the\npresent case.\n  In Laidlaw, plaintiffs’ standing was based on “the prop-\nosition that a company’s continuous and pervasive illegal\ndischarges of pollutants into a river would cause nearby\nresidents to curtail their recreational use of that waterway\nand would subject them to other economic and aesthetic\nharms.” 528 U. S., at 184. Because the unlawful dis-\ncharges of pollutants were “concededly ongoing,” the only\nissue was whether “nearby residents”—who were mem-\nbers of the organizational plaintiffs—acted reasonably in\nrefraining from using the polluted area. Id., at 183–184.\nLaidlaw is therefore quite unlike the present case, in\nwhich it is not “concede[d]” that respondents would be\nsubject to unlawful surveillance but for their decision to\ntake preventive measures.

(same).\nLaidlaw would resemble this case only if (1) it were\nundisputed that the Government was using §1881a-\nauthorized surveillance to acquire respondents’ communi-\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncations and (2) the sole dispute concerned the reasonable-\nness of respondents’ preventive measures.\n    In Keene, the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of\nthe Government’s decision to label three films as “political\npropaganda.” 481 U. S., at 467. The Court held that the\nplaintiff, who was an attorney and a state legislator, had\nstanding because he demonstrated, through “detailed\naffidavits,” that he “could not exhibit the films without\nincurring a risk of injury to his reputation and of an im-\npairment of his political career.” Id., at 467, 473–475.\nUnlike the present case, Keene involved “more than a\n‘subjective chill’ ” based on speculation about potential\ngovernmental action; the plaintiff in that case was un-\nquestionably regulated by the relevant statute, and the\nfilms that he wished to exhibit had already been labeled\nas “political propaganda.” See ibid.; ACLU, 493 F. 3d, at\n663–664 (opinion of Batchelder, J.); id., at 691 (Gibbons,\nJ., concurring).\n    Monsanto, on which respondents also rely, is likewise\ninapposite. In Monsanto, conventional alfalfa farmers had\nstanding to seek injunctive relief because the agency’s\ndecision to deregulate a variety of genetically engineered\nalfalfa gave rise to a “significant risk of gene flow to\nnon-genetically-engineered varieties of alfalfa.” 561 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 13). The standing analysis in that case\nhinged on evidence that genetically engineered alfalfa\n“ ‘seed fields [we]re currently being planted in all the\nmajor alfalfa seed production areas’ ”; the bees that polli-\nnate alfalfa “ ‘have a range of at least two to ten miles’ ”;\nand the alfalfa seed farms were concentrated in an area\nwell within the bees’ pollination range. Id., at ___–___,\nand n. 3 (slip op., at 11–12, and n. 3). Unlike the conven-\ntional alfalfa farmers in Monsanto, however, respondents\nin the present case present no concrete evidence to sub-\nstantiate their fears, but instead rest on mere conjecture\nabout possible governmental actions.\n22         CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n  Respondents also suggest that they should be held to\nhave standing because otherwise the constitutionality\nof §1881a could not be challenged. It would be wrong,\nthey maintain, to “insulate the government’s surveillance\nactivities from meaningful judicial review.” Brief for\nRespondents 60. Respondents’ suggestion is both legally\nand factually incorrect. First, “ ‘[t]he assumption that if\nrespondents have no standing to sue, no one would have\nstanding, is not a reason to find standing.’ ” Valley Forge\nChristian College, 454 U. S., at 489; Schlesinger, 418 U. S.,\nat 227; see also Richardson, 418 U. S., at 179; Raines, 521\nU. S., at 835 (Souter, J., joined by GINSBURG, J., concur-\nring in judgment).\n  Second, our holding today by no means insulates §1881a\nfrom judicial review.      As described above, Congress\ncreated a comprehensive scheme in which the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court evaluates the Government’s\ncertifications, targeting procedures, and minimization\nprocedures—including assessing whether the targeting\nand minimization procedures comport with the Fourth\nAmendment. §§1881a(a), (c)(1), (i)(2), (i)(3). Any dissatis-\nfaction that respondents may have about the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court’s rulings—or the congres-\nsional delineation of that court’s role—is irrelevant to our\nstanding analysis.\n  Additionally, if the Government intends to use or dis-\nclose information obtained or derived from a §1881a ac-\nquisition in judicial or administrative proceedings, it\nmust provide advance notice of its intent, and the affected\nperson may challenge the lawfulness of the acquisition.\n§§1806(c), 1806(e), 1881e(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. V).8\n——————\n 8 The possibility of judicial review in this context is not farfetched. In\n\nUnited States v. Damrah, 412 F. 3d 618 (CA6 2005), for example, the\nGovernment made a pretrial disclosure that it intended to use FISA\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                23\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nThus, if the Government were to prosecute one of\nrespondent-attorney’s foreign clients using §1881a-authorized\nsurveillance, the Government would be required to make a\ndisclosure. Although the foreign client might not have a\nviable Fourth Amendment claim, see, e.g., United States v.\nVerdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 261 (1990), it is possible\nthat the monitoring of the target’s conversations with his\nor her attorney would provide grounds for a claim of\nstanding on the part of the attorney. Such an attorney\nwould certainly have a stronger evidentiary basis for\nestablishing standing than do respondents in the present\ncase. In such a situation, unlike in the present case,\nit would at least be clear that the Government had ac-\nquired the foreign client’s communications using §1881a-\nauthorized surveillance.\n   Finally, any electronic communications service provider\nthat the Government directs to assist in §1881a surveil-\nlance may challenge the lawfulness of that directive before\nthe FISC. §§1881a(h)(4), (6). Indeed, at the behest of a\nservice provider, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nCourt of Review previously analyzed the constitutionality\nof electronic surveillance directives issued pursuant to a\nnow-expired set of FISA amendments. See In re Directives\nPursuant to Section 105B of Foreign Intelligence Surveil-\nlance Act, 551 F. 3d 1004, 1006–1016 (2008) (holding that\nthe provider had standing and that the directives were\nconstitutional).\n                     *   *     *\n  We hold that respondents lack Article III standing\nbecause they cannot demonstrate that the future injury\n——————\nevidence in a prosecution; the defendant (unsuccessfully) moved to\nsuppress the FISA evidence, even though he had not been the target of\nthe surveillance; and the Sixth Circuit ultimately held that FISA’s\nprocedures are consistent with the Fourth Amendment. See id., at 622,\n623, 625.\n24      CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nthey purportedly fear is certainly impending and because\nthey cannot manufacture standing by incurring costs in\nanticipation of non-imminent harm. We therefore reverse\nthe judgment of the Second Circuit and remand the case\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

S. C. §1881a (2006 ed., Supp. V), will harm them by\nintercepting at least some of their private, foreign, tele­\nphone, or e-mail conversations. In my view, this harm is\nnot “speculative.” Indeed it is as likely to take place as are\nmost future events that commonsense inference and ordi­\nnary knowledge of human nature tell us will happen. This\nCourt has often found the occurrence of similar future\nevents sufficiently certain to support standing. I dissent\nfrom the Court’s contrary conclusion.\n                              I\n  Article III specifies that the “judicial Power” of the\nUnited States extends only to actual “Cases” and “Contro­\nversies.” §2. It thereby helps to ensure that the legal\nquestions presented to the federal courts will not take the\nform of abstract intellectual problems resolved in the\n“rarified atmosphere of a debating society” but instead\nthose questions will be presented “in a concrete factual\ncontext conducive to a realistic appreciation of the conse­\nquences of judicial action.” Valley Forge Christian College\n2        CLAPPER v.

S. 289, 297\n(1979) (similar).\n   The Court has recognized that the precise boundaries of\nthe “case or controversy” requirement are matters of “de­\ngree . . . not discernible by any precise test.” Ibid. At the\nsame time, the Court has developed a subsidiary set of\nlegal rules that help to determine when the Constitution’s\nrequirement is met. See Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560–561; id.,\nat 583 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Thus, a\nplaintiff must have “standing” to bring a legal claim. And\na plaintiff has that standing, the Court has said, only if\nthe action or omission that the plaintiff challenges has\ncaused, or will cause, the plaintiff to suffer an injury that\nis “concrete and particularized,” “actual or imminent,” and\n“redress[able] by a favorable decision.” Id., at 560–561\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   No one here denies that the Government’s interception\nof a private telephone or e-mail conversation amounts to\nan injury that is “concrete and particularized.” Moreover,\nthe plaintiffs, respondents here, seek as relief a judgment\ndeclaring unconstitutional (and enjoining enforcement of)\na statutory provision authorizing those interceptions; and,\nsuch a judgment would redress the injury by preventing it.\nThus, the basic question is whether the injury, i.e., the\ninterception, is “actual or imminent.”\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n  Since the plaintiffs fear interceptions of a kind author­\nized by §1881a, it is important to understand just what\nkind of surveillance that section authorizes. Congress\nenacted §1881a in 2008, as an amendment to the pre­\nexisting Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, 50\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. C. §1801 et seq. Before the amendment, the Act\nauthorized the Government (acting within the United\nStates) to monitor private electronic communications\nbetween the United States and a foreign country if (1) the\nGovernment’s purpose was, in significant part, to obtain\nforeign intelligence information (which includes infor­\nmation concerning a “foreign power” or “territory” related\nto our “national defense” or “security” or the “conduct of\n. . . foreign affairs”), (2) the Government’s surveillance\ntarget was “a foreign power or an agent of a foreign\npower,” and (3) the Government used surveillance proce­\ndures designed to “minimize the acquisition and retention, and\nprohibit the dissemination, of ” any private information\nacquired about Americans. §§1801(e), (h), 1804(a).\n    In addition the Government had to obtain the approval\nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. To do so, it\nhad to submit an application describing (1) each “specific\ntarget,” (2) the “nature of the information sought,” and (3)\nthe “type of communications or activities to be subjected\nto the surveillance.” §1804(a). It had to certify that, in\nsignificant part, it sought to obtain foreign intelligence\ninformation. Ibid. It had to demonstrate probable cause\nto believe that each specific target was “a foreign power or\nan agent of a foreign power.” §§1804(a), 1805(a). It also\nhad to describe instance-specific procedures to be used\nto minimize intrusions upon Americans’ privacy (compli­\nance with which the court subsequently could assess).\n§§1804(a), 1805(d)(3).\n    The addition of §1881a in 2008 changed this prior law in\nthree important ways. First, it eliminated the require­\nment that the Government describe to the court each\nspecific target and identify each facility at which its sur­\nveillance would be directed, thus permitting surveillance\non a programmatic, not necessarily individualized, basis.\n§1881a(g). Second, it eliminated the requirement that a\ntarget be a “foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.”\n4        CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nIbid.    Third, it diminished the court’s authority to\ninsist upon, and eliminated its authority to supervise,\ninstance-specific privacy-intrusion minimization procedures\n(though the Government still must use court-approved\ngeneral minimization procedures). §1881a(e). Thus, using\nthe authority of §1881a, the Government can obtain court\napproval for its surveillance of electronic communications\nbetween places within the United States and targets in\nforeign territories by showing the court (1) that “a sig­\nnificant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign\nintelligence information,” and (2) that it will use general\ntargeting and privacy-intrusion minimization procedures of\na kind that the court had previously approved. §1881a(g).\n                              B\n   It is similarly important to understand the kinds of\ncommunications in which the plaintiffs say they engage\nand which they believe the Government will intercept.\nPlaintiff Scott McKay, for example, says in an affidavit (1)\nthat he is a lawyer; (2) that he represented “Mr. Sami\nOmar Al-Hussayen, who was acquitted in June 2004 on\nterrorism charges”; (3) that he continues to represent “Mr.\nAl-Hussayen, who, in addition to facing criminal charges\nafter September 11, was named as a defendant in several\ncivil cases”; (4) that he represents Khalid Sheik Moham­\nmed, a detainee, “before the Military Commissions at\nGuantánamo Bay, Cuba”; (5) that in representing these\nclients he “communicate[s] by telephone and email with\npeople outside the United States, including Mr. Al-\nHussayen himself,” “experts, investigators, attorneys,\nfamily members . . . and others who are located abroad”;\nand (6) that prior to 2008 “the U. S. government had\nintercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and 20,000 email\ncommunications involving [his client] Al-Hussayen.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 369a–371a.\n   Another plaintiff, Sylvia Royce, says in her affidavit (1)\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat she is an attorney; (2) that she “represent[s] Mo­\nhammedou Ould Salahi, a prisoner who has been held at\nGuantánamo Bay as an enemy combatant”; (3) that, “[i]n\nconnection with [her] representation of Mr. Salahi, [she]\nreceive[s] calls from time to time from Mr. Salahi’s\nbrother, . . . a university student in Germany”; and (4)\nthat she has been told that the Government has threatened\nSalahi “that his family members would be arrested and mis­\ntreated if he did not cooperate.” Id., at 349a–351a.\n  The plaintiffs have noted that McKay no longer repre­\nsents Mohammed and Royce no longer represents Ould\nSalahi. Brief for Respondents 15, n. 11. But these changes\nare irrelevant, for we assess standing as of the time a\nsuit is filed, see Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n, 554\nU. S. 724, 734 (2008), and in any event McKay himself\ncontinues to represent Al Hussayen, his partner now\nrepresents Mohammed, and Royce continues to represent\nindividuals held in the custody of the U. S. military\noverseas.\n  A third plaintiff, Joanne Mariner, says in her affidavit\n(1) that she is a human rights researcher, (2) that “some of\nthe work [she] do[es] involves trying to track down people\nwho were rendered by the CIA to countries in which they\nwere tortured”; (3) that many of those people “the CIA has\nsaid are (or were) associated with terrorist organizations”;\nand (4) that, to do this research, she “communicate[s] by\ntelephone and e-mail with . . . former detainees, lawyers\nfor detainees, relatives of detainees, political activists,\njournalists, and fixers” “all over the world, including in\nJordan, Egypt, Pakistan, Afghanistan, [and] the Gaza\nStrip.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 343a–344a.\n  Other plaintiffs, including lawyers, journalists, and\nhuman rights researchers, say in affidavits (1) that they\nhave jobs that require them to gather information from\nforeigners located abroad; (2) that they regularly com­\nmunicate electronically (e.g., by telephone or e-mail) with\n6        CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nforeigners located abroad; and (3) that in these communi­\ncations they exchange “foreign intelligence information” as\nthe Act defines it. Id., at 334a–375a.\n                              III\n   Several considerations, based upon the record along\nwith commonsense inferences, convince me that there is a\nvery high likelihood that Government, acting under the\nauthority of §1881a, will intercept at least some of the\ncommunications just described. First, the plaintiffs have\nengaged, and continue to engage, in electronic communica­\ntions of a kind that the 2008 amendment, but not the prior\nAct, authorizes the Government to intercept. These com­\nmunications include discussions with family members of\nthose detained at Guantanamo, friends and acquaintances\nof those persons, and investigators, experts and others\nwith knowledge of circumstances related to terrorist activ­\nities. These persons are foreigners located outside the\nUnited States. They are not “foreign power[s]” or “agent[s]\nof . . . foreign power[s].” And the plaintiffs state that they\nexchange with these persons “foreign intelligence infor­\nmation,” defined to include information that “relates to”\n“international terrorism” and “the national defense or the\nsecurity of the United States.” See 50 U. S. C. §1801 (2006\ned. and Supp. V); see, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 342a,\n366a, 373a–374a.\n   Second, the plaintiffs have a strong motive to engage in,\nand the Government has a strong motive to listen to,\nconversations of the kind described. A lawyer represent­\ning a client normally seeks to learn the circumstances\nsurrounding the crime (or the civil wrong) of which the\nclient is accused. A fair reading of the affidavit of Scott\nMcKay, for example, taken together with elementary\nconsiderations of a lawyer’s obligation to his client, indi­\ncates that McKay will engage in conversations that con­\ncern what suspected foreign terrorists, such as his client,\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhave done; in conversations that concern his clients’ fami­\nlies, colleagues, and contacts; in conversations that con­\ncern what those persons (or those connected to them) have\nsaid and done, at least in relation to terrorist activities; in\nconversations that concern the political, social, and com­\nmercial environments in which the suspected terrorists\nhave lived and worked; and so forth. See, e.g., id., at\n373a–374a. Journalists and human rights workers have\nstrong similar motives to conduct conversations of this\nkind. See, e.g., id., at 342a (Declaration of Joanne Mari­\nner, stating that “some of the information [she] ex­\nchange[s] by telephone and e-mail relates to terrorism and\ncounterterrorism, and much of the information relates to\nthe foreign affairs of the United States”).\n   At the same time, the Government has a strong motive\nto conduct surveillance of conversations that contain\nmaterial of this kind. The Government, after all, seeks to\nlearn as much as it can reasonably learn about suspected\nterrorists (such as those detained at Guantanamo), as well\nas about their contacts and activities, along with those of\nfriends and family members. See Executive Office of the\nPresident, Office of Management and Budget, Statement\nof Administration Policy on S. 2248, p. 4 (Dec. 17, 2007)\n(“Part of the value of the [new authority] is to enable the\nIntelligence Community to collect expeditiously the com­\nmunications of terrorists in foreign countries who may\ncontact an associate in the United States”). And the Gov­\nernment is motivated to do so, not simply by the desire to\nhelp convict those whom the Government believes guilty,\nbut also by the critical, overriding need to protect America\nfrom terrorism. See id., at 1 (“Protection of the American\npeople and American interests at home and abroad re­\nquires access to timely, accurate, and insightful intelli­\ngence on the capabilities, intentions, and activities of . . .\nterrorists”).\n   Third, the Government’s past behavior shows that it has\n8        CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsought, and hence will in all likelihood continue to seek,\ninformation about alleged terrorists and detainees\nthrough means that include surveillance of electronic\ncommunications. As just pointed out, plaintiff Scott\nMcKay states that the Government (under the authority of\nthe pre-2008 law) “intercepted some 10,000 telephone calls\nand 20,000 email communications involving [his client]\nMr. Al-Hussayen.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 370a.\n   Fourth, the Government has the capacity to conduct\nelectronic surveillance of the kind at issue. To some de­\ngree this capacity rests upon technology available to the\nGovernment. See 1 D. Kris & J. Wilson, National Security\nInvestigations & Prosecutions §16:6, p. 562 (2d ed. 2012)\n(“NSA’s technological abilities are legendary”); id., §16:12,\nat 572–577 (describing the National Security Agency’s\ncapacity to monitor “very broad facilities” such as interna­\ntional switches). See, e.g., Lichtblau & Risen, Spy Agency\nMined Vast Data Trove, Officials Report, N. Y. Times, Dec.\n24, 2005, p. A1 (describing capacity to trace and to analyze\nlarge volumes of communications into and out of the\nUnited States); Lichtblau & Shane, Bush is Pressed Over New\nReport on Surveillance, N. Y. Times, May 12, 2006, p. A1\n(reporting capacity to obtain access to records of many, if\nnot most, telephone calls made in the United States);\nPriest & Arkin, A Hidden World, Growing Beyond Control,\nWashington Post, July 19, 2010, p. A1 (reporting that\nevery day, collection systems at the National Security\nAgency intercept and store 1.7 billion e-mails, telephone\ncalls and other types of communications). Cf. Statement\nof Administration Policy on S. 2248, supra, at 3 (rejecting\na provision of the Senate bill that would require intelli­\ngence analysts to count “the number of persons located in\nthe United States whose communications were reviewed”\nas “impossible to implement” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). This capacity also includes the Government’s\nauthority to obtain the kind of information here at issue\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfrom private carriers such as AT&T and Verizon. See 50\nU. S. C. §1881a(h). We are further told by amici that the\nGovernment is expanding that capacity. See Brief for\nElectronic Privacy Information Center et al. as 22–23\n(National Security Agency will be able to conduct surveil­\nlance of most electronic communications between domestic\nand foreign points).\n   Of course, to exercise this capacity the Government\nmust have intelligence court authorization. But the Gov­\nernment rarely files requests that fail to meet the statu­\ntory criteria. See Letter from Ronald Weich, Assistant\nAttorney General, to Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 1 (Apr. 30,\n2012) (In 2011, of the 1,676 applications to the intelligence\ncourt, two were withdrawn by the Government, and the\nremaining 1,674 were approved, 30 with some mod­\nification),   online    at     http://www.justice.gov/nsd/foia/\nfoia_library/2011fisa-ltr.pdf. (as visited Feb. 22, 2013, and\navailable in Clerk of Court’s case file). As the intelligence\ncourt itself has stated, its review under §1881a is “nar­\nrowly circumscribed.” In re Proceedings Required by §702(i)\nof the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, No. Misc. 08–01\n(Aug. 17, 2008), p. 3. There is no reason to believe that\nthe communications described would all fail to meet the\nconditions necessary for approval. Moreover, compared\nwith prior law, §1881a simplifies and thus expedites the\napproval process, making it more likely that the Govern­\nment will use §1881a to obtain the necessary approval.\n   The upshot is that (1) similarity of content, (2) strong\nmotives, (3) prior behavior, and (4) capacity all point to a\nvery strong likelihood that the Government will intercept\nat least some of the plaintiffs’ communications, including\nsome that the 2008 amendment, §1881a, but not the pre­\n2008 Act, authorizes the Government to intercept.\n   At the same time, nothing suggests the presence of some\nspecial factor here that might support a contrary conclu­\nsion. The Government does not deny that it has both the\n10       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmotive and the capacity to listen to communications of the\nkind described by plaintiffs. Nor does it describe any\nsystem for avoiding the interception of an electronic com­\nmunication that happens to include a party who is an\nAmerican lawyer, journalist, or human rights worker.\nOne can, of course, always imagine some special circum­\nstance that negates a virtual likelihood, no matter how\nstrong. But the same is true about most, if not all, ordi­\nnary inferences about future events. Perhaps, despite\npouring rain, the streets will remain dry (due to the pres­\nence of a special chemical). But ordinarily a party that\nseeks to defeat a strong natural inference must bear the\nburden of showing that some such special circumstance\nexists. And no one has suggested any such special circum­\nstance here.\n  Consequently, we need only assume that the Govern­\nment is doing its job (to find out about, and combat, terror­\nism) in order to conclude that there is a high probability\nthat the Government will intercept at least some elec­\ntronic communication to which at least some of the plaintiffs\nare parties. The majority is wrong when it describes the\nharm threatened plaintiffs as “speculative.”\n                               IV \n\n                                A\n\n   The majority more plausibly says that the plaintiffs\nhave failed to show that the threatened harm is “certainly\nimpending.” Ante, at 10 (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). But, as the majority appears to concede, see ante, at\n15–16, and n. 5, certainty is not, and never has been, the\ntouchstone of standing. The future is inherently uncer­\ntain. Yet federal courts frequently entertain actions for\ninjunctions and for declaratory relief aimed at preventing\nfuture activities that are reasonably likely or highly likely,\nbut not absolutely certain, to take place. And that degree\nof certainty is all that is needed to support standing here.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court’s use of the term “certainly impending” is not\nto the contrary. Sometimes the Court has used the phrase\n“certainly impending” as if the phrase described a suffi-\ncient, rather than a necessary, condition for jurisdiction.\nSee Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553, 593\n(1923) (“If the injury is certainly impending that is\nenough”). See also Babbitt, 442 U. S., at 298 (same). On\nother occasions, it has used the phrase as if it concerned\nwhen, not whether, an alleged injury would occur. Thus,\nin Lujan, 504 U. S., at 564, n. 2, the Court considered a\nthreatened future injury that consisted of harm that\nplaintiffs would suffer when they “soon” visited a gov­\nernment project area that (they claimed) would suffer\nenvironmental damage. The Court wrote that a “mere pro­\nfession of an intent, some day, to return” to the project area\ndid not show the harm was “imminent,” for “soon” might\nmean nothing more than “in this lifetime.” Id., at 564–\n565, n. 2 (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly,\nin McConnell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93\n(2003), the Court denied standing because the Senator’s\nfuture injury (stemming from a campaign finance law)\nwould not affect him until his reelection. That fact, the\nCourt said, made the injury “too remote temporally to\nsatisfy Article III standing.” Id., at 225–226.\n   On still other occasions, recognizing that “ ‘ imminence’\nis concededly a somewhat elastic concept,” Lujan, supra,\nat 565, n. 2, the Court has referred to, or used (sometimes\nalong with “certainly impending”) other phrases such as\n“reasonable probability” that suggest less than absolute,\nor literal certainty. See Babbitt, supra, at 298 (plaintiff\n“must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct\ninjury” (emphasis added)); Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.\nLaidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S.\n167, 190 (2000) (“[I]t is the plaintiff ’s burden to establish\nstanding by demonstrating that . . . the defendant’s alleg­\nedly wrongful behavior will likely occur or continue”).

S. 352, 367–368 (1980) (“likely”); Buckley v. Valeo,\n424 U. S. 1, 74 (1976) (per curiam) (“reasonable probabil­\nity”). Taken together the case law uses the word “certain­\nly” as if it emphasizes, rather than literally defines, the\nimmediately following term “impending.”\n                              B\n                              1\n   More important, the Court’s holdings in standing cases\nshow that standing exists here. The Court has often found\nstanding where the occurrence of the relevant injury was\nfar less certain than here. Consider a few, fairly typical,\ncases. Consider Pennell, supra. A city ordinance forbade\nlandlords to raise the rent charged to a tenant by more\nthan 8 percent where doing so would work an unreasona­\nbly severe hardship on that tenant. Id., at 4–5. A group of\nlandlords sought a judgment declaring the ordinance\nunconstitutional. The Court held that, to have standing,\nthe landlords had to demonstrate a “ ‘realistic danger of\nsustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute’s opera­\ntion.’ ” Id., at 8 (emphasis added). It found that the land­\nlords had done so by showing a likelihood of enforcement\nand a “probability,” ibid., that the ordinance would make\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe landlords charge lower rents—even though the land­\nlords had not shown (1) that they intended to raise the\nrelevant rents to the point of causing unreasonably severe\nhardship; (2) that the tenants would challenge those in­\ncreases; or (3) that the city’s hearing examiners and arbi­\ntrators would find against the landlords. Here, even more\nso than in Pennell, there is a “realistic danger” that the\nrelevant harm will occur.\n   Or, consider Blum, supra. A group of nursing home\nresidents receiving Medicaid benefits challenged the con­\nstitutionality (on procedural grounds) of a regulation that\npermitted their nursing home to transfer them to a less\ndesirable home. Id., at 999–1000. Although a Medicaid\ncommittee had recommended transfers, Medicaid-initiated\ntransfer had been enjoined and the nursing home itself\nhad not threatened to transfer the plaintiffs. But the\nCourt found “standing” because “the threat of transfers”\nwas “not ‘imaginary or speculative’ ” but “quite realistic,”\nhence “sufficiently substantial.” Id., at 1000–1001 (quot­\ning Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 42 (1971)). The plain­\ntiffs’ injury here is not imaginary or speculative, but “quite\nrealistic.”\n   Or, consider Davis, supra. The plaintiff, a candidate for\nthe United States House of Representatives, self-financed\nhis campaigns. He challenged the constitutionality of an\nelection law that relaxed the limits on an opponent’s con­\ntributions when a self-financed candidate’s spending itself\nexceeded certain other limits. His opponent, in fact, had\ndecided not to take advantage of the increased contribu­\ntion limits that the statute would have allowed. Id., at\n734. But the Court nonetheless found standing because\nthere was a “realistic and impending threat,” not a cer­\ntainty, that the candidate’s opponent would do so at the\ntime the plaintiff filed the complaint. Id., at 734–735.\nThe threat facing the plaintiffs here is as “realistic and\nimpending.”\n14       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Or, consider MedImmune, supra. The plaintiff, a patent\nlicensee, sought a declaratory judgment that the patent\nwas invalid. But, the plaintiff did not face an imminent\nthreat of suit because it continued making royalty pay­\nments to the patent holder. In explaining why the plain­\ntiff had standing, we (1) assumed that if the plaintiff\nstopped making royalty payments it would have standing\n(despite the fact that the patent holder might not bring\nsuit), (2) rejected the Federal Circuit’s “reasonable ap­\nprehension of imminent suit” requirement, and (3) in­\nstead suggested that a “genuine threat of enforcement” was\nlikely sufficient. Id., at 128, 129, 132, n. 11 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). A “genuine threat” is present\nhere.\n   Moreover, courts have often found probabilistic injuries\nsufficient to support standing. In Duke Power Co. v. Caro-\nlina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59 (1978),\nfor example, the plaintiffs, a group of individuals living\nnear a proposed nuclear powerplant, challenged the con­\nstitutionality of the Price-Anderson Act, a statute that\nlimited the plant’s liability in the case of a nuclear acci­\ndent. The plaintiffs said that, without the Act, the de­\nfendants would not build a nuclear plant. And the building\nof the plant would harm them, in part, by emitting\n“non-natural radiation into [their] environment.” Id., at\n74. The Court found standing in part due to “our general­\nized concern about exposure to radiation and the appre­\nhension flowing from the uncertainty about the health and\ngenetic consequences of even small emissions.” Ibid.\n(emphasis added). See also Monsanto Co., supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 11–12) (“A substantial risk of gene flow injures\nrespondents in several ways” (emphasis added)).\n   See also lower court cases, such as Mountain States\nLegal Foundation v. Glickman, 92 F. 3d 1228, 1234–1235\n(CADC 1996) (plaintiffs attack Government decision to\nlimit timber harvesting; standing based upon increased\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

C., Inc., 419 F. 3d 568, 570–575 (CA6\n2005) (standing based on increased risk of harm caused by\nimplantation of defective medical device); Johnson v.\nAllsteel, Inc., 259 F. 3d 885, 888–891 (CA7 2001) (stand­\ning based on increased risk that Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act beneficiary will not be covered due\nto increased amount of discretion given to ERISA\nadministrator).\n   How could the law be otherwise? Suppose that a federal\ncourt faced a claim by homeowners that (allegedly) unlaw­\nful dam-building practices created a high risk that their\nhomes would be flooded. Would the court deny them\nstanding on the ground that the risk of flood was only 60,\nrather than 90, percent?\n   Would federal courts deny standing to a plaintiff in a\ndiversity action who claims an anticipatory breach of\ncontract where the future breach depends on probabilities?\nThe defendant, say, has threatened to load wheat onto a\nship bound for India despite a promise to send the wheat\nto the United States. No one can know for certain that\nthis will happen. Perhaps the defendant will change his\nmind; perhaps the ship will turn and head for the United\nStates. Yet, despite the uncertainty, the Constitution does\nnot prohibit a federal court from hearing such a claim.\nSee 23 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §63:35 (4th ed.\n2002) (plaintiff may bring an anticipatory breach suit even\nthough the defendant’s promise is one to perform in the\nfuture, it has not yet been broken, and defendant may still\n16       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nretract the repudiation). E.g., Wisconsin Power & Light\nCo. v. Century Indemnity Co., 130 F. 3d 787, 792–793\n(CA7 1997) (plaintiff could sue insurer that disclaimed\nliability for all costs that would be incurred in the future if\nenvironmental agencies required cleanup); Combs v. In-\nternational Ins. Co., 354 F. 3d 568, 598–601 (CA6 2004)\n(similar).\n   Would federal courts deny standing to a plaintiff who\nseeks to enjoin as a nuisance the building of a nearby pond\nwhich, the plaintiff believes, will very likely, but not inevi­\ntably, overflow his land? See 42 Am. Jur. 2d Injunctions\n§§2, 5 (2010) (noting that an injunction is ordinarily pre­\nventive in character and restrains actions that have not\nyet been taken, but threaten injury). E.g., Central Delta\nWater Agency v. United States, 306 F. 3d 938, 947–950\n(CA9 2002) (standing to seek injunction where method of\noperating dam was highly likely to severely hamper plain­\ntiffs’ ability to grow crops); Consolidated Companies, Inc.\nv. Union Pacific R. Co., 499 F. 3d 382, 386 (CA5 2007)\n(standing to seek injunction requiring cleanup of land\nadjacent to plaintiff ’s tract because of threat that contam­\ninants might migrate to plaintiff ’s tract).\n   Neither do ordinary declaratory judgment actions al­\nways involve the degree of certainty upon which the Court\ninsists here. See, e.g., Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific\nCoal & Oil Co., 312 U. S. 270, 273 (1941) (insurance com­\npany could seek declaration that it need not pay claim\nagainst insured automobile driver who was in an accident\neven though the driver had not yet been found liable for\nthe accident); Aetna Life Ins.

See\nalso, e.g., Associated Indemnity Corp. v.

Thus, in Monsanto\nCo., 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11–14) plaintiffs, a group\nof conventional alfalfa growers, challenged an agency\ndecision to deregulate genetically engineered alfalfa. They\nclaimed that deregulation would harm them because their\nneighbors would plant the genetically engineered seed,\nbees would obtain pollen from the neighbors’ plants, and\nthe bees would then (harmfully) contaminate their own\nconventional alfalfa with the genetically modified gene.\nThe lower courts had found a “reasonable probability” that\nthis injury would occur. Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Without expressing views about that probability, we\nfound standing because the plaintiffs would suffer present\nharm by trying to combat the threat. Ibid. The plaintiffs,\nfor example, “would have to conduct testing to find out\nwhether and to what extent their crops have been contam­\ninated.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12). And they would have\nto take “measures to minimize the likelihood of potential\ncontamination and to ensure an adequate supply of\nnon-genetically-engineered alfalfa.” Ibid. We held that these\n“harms, which [the plaintiffs] will suffer even if their crops\nare not actually infected with” the genetically modified\ngene, “are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact\nprong of the constitutional standing analysis.” Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 13).\n   Virtually identical circumstances are present here.\nPlaintiff McKay, for example, points out that, when he\ncommunicates abroad about, or in the interests of, a client\n18       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(e.g., a client accused of terrorism), he must “make an\nassessment” whether his “client’s interests would be com­\npromised” should the Government “acquire the communi­\ncations.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a. If so, he must either\nforgo the communication or travel abroad. Id., at 371a–\n372a (“I have had to take measures to protect the confi­\ndentiality of information that I believe is particularly\nsensitive,” including “travel that is both time-consuming\nand expensive”).\n    Since travel is expensive, since forgoing communication\ncan compromise the client’s interests, since McKay’s as­\nsessment itself takes time and effort, this case does not\ndiffer significantly from Monsanto. And that is so whether\nwe consider the plaintiffs’ present necessary expenditure\nof time and effort as a separate concrete, particularized,\nimminent harm, or consider it as additional evidence that\nthe future harm (an interception) is likely to occur. See\nalso Friends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U. S., at 183–184 (hold­\ning that plaintiffs who curtailed their recreational activi­\nties on a river due to reasonable concerns about the effect\nof pollutant discharges into that river had standing);\nMeese v. Keene, 481 U. S. 465, 475 (1987) (stating that “the\nneed to take . . . affirmative steps to avoid the risk of harm\n. . . constitutes a cognizable injury”).\n                             3\n  The majority cannot find support in cases that use the\nwords “certainly impending” to deny standing. While I do\nnot claim to have read every standing case, I have exam­\nined quite a few, and not yet found any such case. The\nmajority refers to Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149\n(1990). But in that case the Court denied standing to a\nprisoner who challenged the validity of a death sentence\ngiven to a different prisoner who refused to challenge his\nown sentence. The plaintiff feared that in the absence of\nan appeal, his fellow prisoner’s death sentence would be\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmissing from the State’s death penalty database and\nthereby skew the database against him, making it less\nlikely his challenges to his own death penalty would suc­\nceed. The Court found no standing. Id., at 161. But the\nfellow prisoner’s lack of appeal would have harmed the\nplaintiff only if (1) the plaintiff separately obtained federal\nhabeas relief and was then reconvicted and resentenced to\ndeath, (2) he sought review of his new sentence, and (3)\nduring that review, his death sentence was affirmed only\nbecause it was compared to an artificially skewed data­\nbase. Id., at 156–157. These events seemed not very\nlikely to occur.\n   In DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332 (2006),\ntaxpayers challenged the constitutionality of a tax break\noffered by state and local governments to a car manufac­\nturer. We found no standing. But the plaintiffs would\nhave suffered resulting injury only if that the tax break\nhad depleted state and local treasuries and the legislature\nhad responded by raising their taxes. Id., at 344.\n   In Lujan, the case that may come closest to supporting\nthe majority, the Court also found no standing. But, as I\npointed out, supra, at 11, Lujan is a case where the Court\nconsidered when, not whether, the threatened harm would\noccur. 504 U. S., at 564, n. 2. The relevant injury there\nconsisted of a visit by environmental group’s members to a\nproject site where they would find (unlawful) environmen­\ntal depredation. Id., at 564. The Court pointed out that\nmembers had alleged that they would visit the project\nsites “soon.” But it wrote that “soon” might refer to almost\nany time in the future. Ibid., n. 2. By way of contrast, the\nongoing threat of terrorism means that here the relevant\ninterceptions will likely take place imminently, if not now.\n   The Court has, of course, denied standing in other cases.\nBut they involve injuries less likely, not more likely, to\noccur than here. In a recent case, Summers v. Earth\nIsland Institute, 555 U. S. 488 (2009), for example, the\n20       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nplaintiffs challenged a regulation exempting certain tim­\nber sales from public comment and administrative appeal.\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the regulations injured them\nby interfering with their esthetic enjoyment and recrea­\ntional use of the forests. The Court found this harm too\nunlikely to occur to support standing. Id., at 496. The\nCourt noted that one plaintiff had not pointed to a specific\naffected forest that he would visit. The Court concluded\nthat “[t]here may be a chance, but . . . hardly a likelihood,”\nthat the plaintiff ’s “wanderings will bring him to a parcel\nabout to be affected by a project unlawfully subject to the\nregulations.” Id., at 495 (emphasis added).\n                              4\n  In sum, as the Court concedes, see ante, at 15–16, and\nn. 5, the word “certainly” in the phrase “certainly impend­\ning” does not refer to absolute certainty. As our case law\ndemonstrates, what the Constitution requires is some­\nthing more akin to “reasonable probability” or “high prob­\nability.” The use of some such standard is all that is\nnecessary here to ensure the actual concrete injury that\nthe Constitution demands. The considerations set forth in\nParts II and III, supra, make clear that the standard is\nreadily met in this case.\n                         *    *     *\n  While I express no view on the merits of the plaintiffs’\nconstitutional claims, I do believe that at least some of the\nplaintiffs have standing to make those claims. I dissent,\nwith respect, from the majority’s contrary conclusion.\n</pre>", "id": 821306, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/02/26/clapper_v._amnesty_international_usa.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2012                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued October 29, 2012—Decided February 26, 2013\nSection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA),\n  50 U. S. C. §1881a, added by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008,\n  permits the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelli-\n  gence to acquire foreign intelligence information by jointly authoriz-\n  ing the surveillance of individuals who are not “United States per-\n  sons” and are reasonably believed to be located outside the United\n  States. Before doing so, the Attorney General and the Director of Na-\n  tional Intelligence normally must obtain the Foreign Intelligence\n  Surveillance Court’s (FISC) approval. Surveillance under §1881a is\n  subject to statutory conditions, judicial authorization, congressional\n  supervision, and compliance with the Fourth Amendment. Respond-\n  ents—attorneys and human rights, labor, legal, and media organiza-\n  tions—are United States persons who claim that they engage in sen-\n  sitive international communications with individuals who they\n  believe are likely targets of §1881a surveillance. On the day that the\n  FISA Amendments Act was enacted, they filed suit, seeking a decla-\n  ration that §1881a is facially unconstitutional and a permanent in-\n  junction against §1881a-authorized surveillance. The District Court\n  found that respondents lacked standing, but the Second Circuit re-\n  versed, holding that respondents showed (1) an “objectively reasona-\n  ble likelihood” that their communications will be intercepted at some\n  time in the future, and (2) that they are suffering present injuries re-\n  sulting from costly and burdensome measures they take to protect\n  the confidentiality of their international communications from possi-\n  ble §1881a surveillance.\nHeld: Respondents do not have Article III standing. Pp. 8–24.\n    (a) To establish Article III standing, an injury must be “concrete,\n2            CLAPPER v.

Pp. 8–10.\n       (b) Respondents assert that they have suffered injury in fact that is\n    fairly traceable to §1881a because there is an objectively reasonable\n    likelihood that their communications with their foreign contacts will\n    be intercepted under §1881a at some point. This argument fails. Ini-\n    tially, the Second Circuit’s “objectively reasonable likelihood” stand-\n    ard is inconsistent with this Court’s “threatened injury” requirement.\n    Respondents’ standing theory also rests on a speculative chain of pos-\n    sibilities that does not establish that their potential injury is certain-\n    ly impending or is fairly traceable to §1881a. First, it is highly specu-\n    lative whether the Government will imminently target\n    communications to which respondents are parties. Since respond-\n    ents, as U. S. persons, cannot be targeted under §1881a, their theory\n    necessarily rests on their assertion that their foreign contacts will be\n    targeted. Yet they have no actual knowledge of the Government’s\n    §1881a targeting practices. Second, even if respondents could\n    demonstrate that the targeting of their foreign contacts is imminent,\n    they can only speculate as to whether the Government will seek to\n    use §1881a-authorized surveillance instead of one of the Govern-\n    ment’s numerous other surveillance methods, which are not chal-\n    lenged here. Third, even if respondents could show that the Govern-\n    ment will seek FISC authorization to target respondents’ foreign\n    contacts under §1881a, they can only speculate as to whether the\n    FISC will authorize the surveillance. This Court is reluctant to en-\n    dorse standing theories that require guesswork as to how independ-\n    ent decisionmakers will exercise their judgment. See, e.g., Whitmore,\n    supra, at 159–160. Fourth, even if the Government were to obtain\n    the FISC’s approval to target respondents’ foreign contacts under\n    §1881a, it is unclear whether the Government would succeed in ac-\n    quiring those contacts’ communications. And fifth, even if the Gov-\n    ernment were to target respondents’ foreign contacts, respondents\n    can only speculate as to whether their own communications with\n    those contacts would be incidentally acquired. Pp. 10–15.\n       (c) Respondents’ alternative argument is also unpersuasive. They\n    claim that they suffer ongoing injuries that are fairly traceable to\n    §1881a because the risk of §1881a surveillance requires them to take\n    costly and burdensome measures to protect the confidentiality of\n    their communications. But respondents cannot manufacture stand-\n    ing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  harm that is not certainly impending. Because they do not face a\n  threat of certainly impending interception under §1881a, their costs\n  are simply the product of their fear of surveillance, which is insuffi-\n  cient to create standing. See Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 10–15. Ac-\n  cordingly, any ongoing injuries that respondents are suffering are not\n  fairly traceable to §1881a. Pp. 16–20.\n    (d) Respondents’ remaining arguments are likewise unavailing.\n  Contrary to their claim, their alleged injuries are not the same kinds\n  of injuries that supported standing in cases such as Friends of the\n  Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S.\n  167, Meese v. Keene, 481 U. S. 465, and Monsanto, supra. And their\n  suggestion that they should be held to have standing because other-\n  wise the constitutionality of §1881a will never be adjudicated is both\n  legally and factually incorrect. First, “ ‘[t]he assumption that if re-\n  spondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is\n  not a reason to find standing.’ ” Valley Forge Christian College v.\n  Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S.\n  464, 489. Second, the holding in this case by no means insulates\n  §1881a from judicial review.

S. C. §1881a (2006 ed., Supp. V), allows the\nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence\nto acquire foreign intelligence information by jointly au-\nthorizing the surveillance of individuals who are not\n“United States persons”1 and are reasonably believed to be\nlocated outside the United States. Before doing so, the\nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence\nnormally must obtain the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-\nlance Court’s approval. Respondents are United States\npersons whose work, they allege, requires them to engage\nin sensitive international communications with individ-\nuals who they believe are likely targets of surveillance\nunder §1881a.      Respondents seek a declaration that\n§1881a is unconstitutional, as well as an injunction\nagainst §1881a-authorized surveillance. The question\n——————\n   1 The term “United States person” includes citizens of the United\n\nStates, aliens admitted for permanent residence, and certain associa-\ntions and corporations. 50 U. S. C. §1801(i); see §1881(a).\n2        CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore us is whether respondents have Article III standing\nto seek this prospective relief.\n  Respondents assert that they can establish injury in fact\nbecause there is an objectively reasonable likelihood that\ntheir communications will be acquired under §1881a at\nsome point in the future. But respondents’ theory of fu-\nture injury is too speculative to satisfy the well-established\nrequirement that threatened injury must be “certainly\nimpending.” E.g., Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149,\n158 (1990). And even if respondents could demonstrate\nthat the threatened injury is certainly impending, they\nstill would not be able to establish that this injury is fairly\ntraceable to §1881a. As an alternative argument, re-\nspondents contend that they are suffering present injury\nbecause the risk of §1881a-authorized surveillance al-\nready has forced them to take costly and burdensome meas-\nures to protect the confidentiality of their international\ncommunications. But respondents cannot manufacture stand-\ning by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothet-\nical future harm that is not certainly impending. We\ntherefore hold that respondents lack Article III standing.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  In 1978, after years of debate, Congress enacted the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to authorize\nand regulate certain governmental electronic surveillance\nof communications for foreign intelligence purposes. See\n92 Stat. 1783, 50 U. S. C. §1801 et seq.; 1 D. Kris & J.\nWilson, National Security Investigations & Prosecutions\n§§3.1, 3.7 (2d ed. 2012) (hereinafter Kris & Wilson). In\nenacting FISA, Congress legislated against the backdrop\nof our decision in United States v. United States Dist.\nCourt for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407 U. S. 297 (1972)\n(Keith), in which we explained that the standards and\nprocedures that law enforcement officials must follow\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen conducting “surveillance of ‘ordinary crime’ ” might\nnot be required in the context of surveillance conducted\nfor domestic national-security purposes. Id., at 322–323.\nAlthough the Keith opinion expressly disclaimed any\nruling “on the scope of the President’s surveillance power\nwith respect to the activities of foreign powers,” id., at 308,\nit implicitly suggested that a special framework for foreign\nintelligence surveillance might be constitutionally permis-\nsible, see id., at 322–323.\n   In constructing such a framework for foreign intel-\nligence surveillance, Congress created two specialized\ncourts. In FISA, Congress authorized judges of the For-\neign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to approve\nelectronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes if\nthere is probable cause to believe that “the target of the\nelectronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a\nforeign power,” and that each of the specific “facilities or\nplaces at which the electronic surveillance is directed is\nbeing used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an\nagent of a foreign power.” §105(a)(3), 92 Stat. 1790; see\n§§105(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), ibid.; 1 Kris & Wilson §7:2, at\n194–195; id., §16:2, at 528–529. Additionally, Congress\nvested the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of\nReview with jurisdiction to review any denials by the\nFISC of applications for electronic surveillance. §103(b),\n92 Stat. 1788; 1 Kris & Wilson §5:7, at 151–153.\n   In the wake of the September 11th attacks, President\nGeorge W. Bush authorized the National Security Agency\n(NSA) to conduct warrantless wiretapping of telephone\nand e-mail communications where one party to the com-\nmunication was located outside the United States and a\nparticipant in “the call was reasonably believed to be a\nmember or agent of al Qaeda or an affiliated terrorist\norganization,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 403a. See id., at\n263a–265a, 268a, 273a–279a, 292a–293a; American Civil\nLiberties Union v. NSA, 493 F. 3d 644, 648 (CA6 2007)\n4        CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(ACLU) (opinion of Batchelder, J.). In January 2007, the\nFISC issued orders authorizing the Government to target\ninternational communications into or out of the United\nStates where there was probable cause to believe that one\nparticipant to the communication was a member or agent\nof al Qaeda or an associated terrorist organization. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 312a, 398a, 405a. These FISC orders sub-\njected any electronic surveillance that was then occur-\nring under the NSA’s program to the approval of the FISC.\nId., at 405a; see id., at 312a, 404a. After a FISC Judge\nsubsequently narrowed the FISC’s authorization of such\nsurveillance, however, the Executive asked Congress to\namend FISA so that it would provide the intelligence\ncommunity with additional authority to meet the chal-\nlenges of modern technology and international terrorism.\nId., at 315a–318a, 331a–333a, 398a; see id., at 262a,\n277a–279a, 287a.\n  When Congress enacted the FISA Amendments Act of\n2008 (FISA Amendments Act), 122 Stat. 2436, it left much\nof FISA intact, but it “established a new and independent\nsource of intelligence collection authority, beyond that\ngranted in traditional FISA.” 1 Kris & Wilson §9:11, at\n349–350. As relevant here, §702 of FISA, 50 U. S. C.\n§1881a (2006 ed., Supp. V), which was enacted as part\nof the FISA Amendments Act, supplements pre-existing\nFISA authority by creating a new framework under which\nthe Government may seek the FISC’s authorization of\ncertain foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the\ncommunications of non-U. S. persons located abroad.\nUnlike traditional FISA surveillance, §1881a does not\nrequire the Government to demonstrate probable cause\nthat the target of the electronic surveillance is a for-\neign power or agent of a foreign power.              Compare\n§§1805(a)(2)(A), (a)(2)(B), with §§1881a(d)(1), (i)(3)(A); 638\nF. 3d 118, 126 (CA2 2011); 1 Kris & Wilson §16:16, at 584.\nAnd, unlike traditional FISA, §1881a does not require the\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

Surveillance under §1881a is subject to statutory\nconditions, judicial authorization, congressional supervi-\nsion, and compliance with the Fourth Amendment. Sec-\ntion 1881a provides that, upon the issuance of an order\nfrom the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, “the\nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence\nmay authorize jointly, for a period of up to 1 year . . . , the\ntargeting of persons reasonably believed to be located\noutside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence\ninformation.” §1881a(a). Surveillance under §1881a may\nnot be intentionally targeted at any person known to be in\nthe United States or any U. S. person reasonably believed\nto be located abroad. §§1881a(b)(1)–(3); see also §1801(i).\nAdditionally, acquisitions under §1881a must comport\nwith the Fourth Amendment. §1881a(b)(5). Moreover,\nsurveillance under §1881a is subject to congressional\noversight and several types of Executive Branch review.\nSee §§1881a(f)(2), (l); Amnesty Int’l USA v. McConnell, 646\nF. Supp. 2d 633, 640–641 (SDNY 2009).\n   Section 1881a mandates that the Government obtain\nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s approval of\n“targeting” procedures, “minimization” procedures, and a\ngovernmental certification regarding proposed surveil-\nlance. §§1881a(a), (c)(1), (i)(2), (i)(3). Among other things,\nthe Government’s certification must attest that (1) pro-\ncedures are in place “that have been approved, have\nbeen submitted for approval, or will be submitted with the\n——————\n  2 Congress recently reauthorized the FISA Amendments Act for an-\n\nother five years.

S.\npersons, as appropriate; (3) guidelines have been adopted\nto ensure compliance with targeting limits and the Fourth\nAmendment; and (4) the procedures and guidelines re-\nferred to above comport with the Fourth Amendment.\n§1881a(g)(2); see §1801(h).\n    The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s role\nincludes determining whether the Government’s certifi-\ncation contains the required elements. Additionally, the\nCourt assesses whether the targeting procedures are\n“reasonably designed” (1) to “ensure that an acquisition\n. . . is limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to\nbe located outside the United States” and (2) to “prevent\nthe intentional acquisition of any communication as to\nwhich the sender and all intended recipients are known\n. . . to be located in the United States.” §1881a(i)(2)(B).\nThe Court analyzes whether the minimization procedures\n“meet the definition of minimization procedures under\nsection 1801(h) . . . , as appropriate.” §1881a(i)(2)(C). The\nCourt also assesses whether the targeting and minimiza-\ntion procedures are consistent with the statute and the\nFourth Amendment. See §1881a(i)(3)(A).3\n\n\n\n——————\n  3 The dissent attempts to downplay the safeguards established by\n\n§1881a. See post, at 4 (opinion of BREYER, J.). Notably, the dissent\ndoes not directly acknowledge that §1881a surveillance must comport\nwith the Fourth Amendment, see §1881a(b)(5), and that the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court must assess whether targeting and\nminimization procedures are consistent with the Fourth Amendment,\nsee §1881a(i)(3)(A).\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Respondents believe that some of the people with\nwhom they exchange foreign intelligence information are\nlikely targets of surveillance under §1881a. Specifically,\nrespondents claim that they communicate by telephone\nand e-mail with people the Government “believes or be-\nlieved to be associated with terrorist organizations,” “peo-\nple located in geographic areas that are a special focus” of\nthe Government’s counterterrorism or diplomatic efforts,\nand activists who oppose governments that are supported\nby the United States Government. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n399a.\n   Respondents claim that §1881a compromises their\nability to locate witnesses, cultivate sources, obtain infor-\nmation, and communicate confidential information to their\nclients. Respondents also assert that they “have ceased\nengaging” in certain telephone and e-mail conversations.\nId., at 400a. According to respondents, the threat of sur-\nveillance will compel them to travel abroad in order to\nhave in-person conversations. In addition, respondents\ndeclare that they have undertaken “costly and burden-\nsome measures” to protect the confidentiality of sensitive\ncommunications. Ibid.\n                              C\n  On the day when the FISA Amendments Act was en-\nacted, respondents filed this action seeking (1) a declaration\nthat §1881a, on its face, violates the Fourth Amendment,\nthe First Amendment, Article III, and separation-of-\npowers principles and (2) a permanent injunction against\nthe use of §1881a. Respondents assert what they charac-\n8        CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nterize as two separate theories of Article III standing.\nFirst, they claim that there is an objectively reasonable\nlikelihood that their communications will be acquired\nunder §1881a at some point in the future, thus causing\nthem injury. Second, respondents maintain that the risk\nof surveillance under §1881a is so substantial that they\nhave been forced to take costly and burdensome measures\nto protect the confidentiality of their international com-\nmunications; in their view, the costs they have incurred\nconstitute present injury that is fairly traceable to §1881a.\n   After both parties moved for summary judgment, the\nDistrict Court held that respondents do not have standing.\nMcConnell, 646 F. Supp. 2d, at 635. On appeal, however,\na panel of the Second Circuit reversed. The panel agreed\nwith respondents’ argument that they have standing due\nto the objectively reasonable likelihood that their commu-\nnications will be intercepted at some time in the future.\n638 F. 3d, at 133, 134, 139. In addition, the panel held\nthat respondents have established that they are suffering\n“present injuries in fact—economic and professional\nharms—stemming from a reasonable fear of future harm-\nful government conduct.” Id., at 138. The Second Circuit\ndenied rehearing en banc by an equally divided vote. 667\nF. 3d 163 (2011).\n   Because of the importance of the issue and the novel\nview of standing adopted by the Court of Appeals,\nwe granted certiorari, 566 U.

This argument fails.\nAs an initial matter, the Second Circuit’s “objectively\nreasonable likelihood” standard is inconsistent with our\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirement that “threatened injury must be certainly\nimpending to constitute injury in fact.” Whitmore, supra,\nat 158 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Daim-\nlerChrysler Corp., supra, at 345; Laidlaw, supra, at 190;\nDefenders of Wildlife, supra, at 565, n. 2; Babbitt, supra, at\n298. Furthermore, respondents’ argument rests on their\nhighly speculative fear that: (1) the Government will\ndecide to target the communications of non-U. S. persons\nwith whom they communicate; (2) in doing so, the Gov-\nernment will choose to invoke its authority under §1881a\nrather than utilizing another method of surveillance;\n(3) the Article III judges who serve on the Foreign Intelli-\ngence Surveillance Court will conclude that the Govern-\nment’s proposed surveillance procedures satisfy §1881a’s\nmany safeguards and are consistent with the Fourth\nAmendment; (4) the Government will succeed in inter-\ncepting the communications of respondents’ contacts; and\n(5) respondents will be parties to the particular communi-\ncations that the Government intercepts. As discussed\nbelow, respondents’ theory of standing, which relies on a\nhighly attenuated chain of possibilities, does not satisfy\nthe requirement that threatened injury must be certainly\nimpending. See Summers, supra, at 496 (rejecting a\nstanding theory premised on a speculative chain of possi-\nbilities); Whitmore, supra, at 157–160 (same). Moreover,\neven if respondents could demonstrate injury in fact, the\nsecond link in the above-described chain of contingen-\ncies—which amounts to mere speculation about whether\nsurveillance would be under §1881a or some other author-\nity—shows that respondents cannot satisfy the require-\nment that any injury in fact must be fairly traceable to\n§1881a.\n   First, it is speculative whether the Government will\nimminently target communications to which respondents\nare parties. Section 1881a expressly provides that re-\nspondents, who are U. S. persons, cannot be targeted for\n12       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsurveillance under §1881a. See §§1881a(b)(1)–(3); 667\nF. 3d, at 173 (Raggi, J., dissenting from denial of rehear-\ning en banc). Accordingly, it is no surprise that respond-\nents fail to offer any evidence that their communications\nhave been monitored under §1881a, a failure that sub-\nstantially undermines their standing theory. See ACLU,\n493 F. 3d, at 655–656, 673–674 (opinion of Batchelder, J.)\n(concluding that plaintiffs who lacked evidence that their\ncommunications had been intercepted did not have stand-\ning to challenge alleged NSA surveillance). Indeed, re-\nspondents do not even allege that the Government has\nsought the FISC’s approval for surveillance of their com-\nmunications. Accordingly, respondents’ theory necessarily\nrests on their assertion that the Government will target\nother individuals—namely, their foreign contacts.\n   Yet respondents have no actual knowledge of the\nGovernment’s §1881a targeting practices. Instead, re-\nspondents merely speculate and make assumptions about\nwhether their communications with their foreign contacts\nwill be acquired under §1881a. See 667 F. 3d, at 185–187\n(opinion of Raggi, J.). For example, journalist Christopher\nHedges states: “I have no choice but to assume that any of\nmy international communications may be subject to gov-\nernment surveillance, and I have to make decisions . . . in\nlight of that assumption.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 366a\n(emphasis added and deleted). Similarly, attorney Scott\nMcKay asserts that, “[b]ecause of the [FISA Amendments\nAct], we now have to assume that every one of our interna-\ntional communications may be monitored by the govern-\nment.” Id., at 375a (emphasis added); see also id., at 337a,\n343a–344a, 350a, 356a. “The party invoking federal juris-\ndiction bears the burden of establishing” standing—and,\nat the summary judgment stage, such a party “can no\nlonger rest on . . . ‘mere allegations,’ but must ‘set forth’ by\naffidavit or other evidence ‘specific facts.’ ” Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U. S., at 561. Respondents, however, have\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

More-\nover, because §1881a at most authorizes—but does not\nmandate or direct—the surveillance that respondents fear,\nrespondents’ allegations are necessarily conjectural. See\nUnited Presbyterian Church in U. S. A. v. Reagan, 738\nF. 2d 1375, 1380 (CADC 1984) (Scalia, J.); 667 F. 3d, at\n187 (opinion of Raggi, J.). Simply put, respondents can\nonly speculate as to how the Attorney General and the\nDirector of National Intelligence will exercise their discre-\ntion in determining which communications to target.4\n   Second, even if respondents could demonstrate that the\ntargeting of their foreign contacts is imminent, respond-\nents can only speculate as to whether the Government will\nseek to use §1881a-authorized surveillance (rather than\nother methods) to do so. The Government has numerous\nother methods of conducting surveillance, none of which is\nchallenged here. Even after the enactment of the FISA\nAmendments Act, for example, the Government may still\nconduct electronic surveillance of persons abroad under\nthe older provisions of FISA so long as it satisfies the\n——————\n   4 It was suggested at oral argument that the Government could help\n\nresolve the standing inquiry by disclosing to a court, perhaps through\nan in camera proceeding, (1) whether it is intercepting respondents’\ncommunications and (2) what targeting or minimization procedures it\nis using. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13–14, 44, 56. This suggestion is puz-\nzling. As an initial matter, it is respondents’ burden to prove their\nstanding by pointing to specific facts, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U. S. 555, 561 (1992), not the Government’s burden to disprove\nstanding by revealing details of its surveillance priorities. Moreover,\nthis type of hypothetical disclosure proceeding would allow a terrorist\n(or his attorney) to determine whether he is currently under U. S.\nsurveillance simply by filing a lawsuit challenging the Government’s\nsurveillance program. Even if the terrorist’s attorney were to comply\nwith a protective order prohibiting him from sharing the Government’s\ndisclosures with his client, the court’s postdisclosure decision about\nwhether to dismiss the suit for lack of standing would surely signal to\nthe terrorist whether his name was on the list of surveillance targets.\n14       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\napplicable requirements, including a demonstration of\nprobable cause to believe that the person is a foreign\npower or agent of a foreign power. See §1805. The Gov-\nernment may also obtain information from the intelligence\nservices of foreign nations. Brief for Petitioners 33. And,\nalthough we do not reach the question, the Government\ncontends that it can conduct FISA-exempt human and\ntechnical surveillance programs that are governed by\nExecutive Order 12333. See Exec. Order No. 12333, §§1.4,\n2.1–2.5, 3 CFR 202, 210–212 (1981), reprinted as amended,\nnote following 50 U. S. C. §401, pp. 543, 547–548. Even\nif respondents could demonstrate that their foreign\ncontacts will imminently be targeted—indeed, even if they\ncould show that interception of their own communications\nwill imminently occur—they would still need to show\nthat their injury is fairly traceable to §1881a. But, be-\ncause respondents can only speculate as to whether any\n(asserted) interception would be under §1881a or some\nother authority, they cannot satisfy the “fairly traceable”\nrequirement.\n  Third, even if respondents could show that the Govern-\nment will seek the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nCourt’s authorization to acquire the communications of\nrespondents’ foreign contacts under §1881a, respondents\ncan only speculate as to whether that court will authorize\nsuch surveillance. In the past, we have been reluctant to\nendorse standing theories that require guesswork as to\nhow independent decisionmakers will exercise their judg-\nment. In Whitmore, for example, the plaintiff ’s theory of\nstanding hinged largely on the probability that he would\nobtain federal habeas relief and be convicted upon retrial.\nIn holding that the plaintiff lacked standing, we explained\nthat “[i]t is just not possible for a litigant to prove in ad-\nvance that the judicial system will lead to any particular\nresult in his case.” 495 U. S., at 159–160; see Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U. S., at 562.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   We decline to abandon our usual reluctance to endorse\nstanding theories that rest on speculation about the deci-\nsions of independent actors. Section 1881a mandates that\nthe Government must obtain the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Court’s approval of targeting procedures,\nminimization procedures, and a governmental certification\nregarding proposed surveillance. §§1881a(a), (c)(1), (i)(2),\n(i)(3). The Court must, for example, determine whether\nthe Government’s procedures are “reasonably designed . . .\nto minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the\ndissemination, of nonpublicly available information con-\ncerning unconsenting United States persons.” §1801(h);\nsee §§1881a(i)(2), (i)(3)(A). And, critically, the Court must\nalso assess whether the Government’s targeting and\nminimization procedures comport with the Fourth Amend-\nment. §1881a(i)(3)(A).\n   Fourth, even if the Government were to obtain the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s approval to tar-\nget respondents’ foreign contacts under §1881a, it is\nunclear whether the Government would succeed in acquir-\ning the communications of respondents’ foreign contacts.\nAnd fifth, even if the Government were to conduct surveil-\nlance of respondents’ foreign contacts, respondents can\nonly speculate as to whether their own communications\nwith their foreign contacts would be incidentally acquired.\n   In sum, respondents’ speculative chain of possibilities\ndoes not establish that injury based on potential future\nsurveillance is certainly impending or is fairly traceable to\n§1881a.5\n——————\n  5 Our cases do not uniformly require plaintiffs to demonstrate that it\n\nis literally certain that the harms they identify will come about. In\nsome instances, we have found standing based on a “substantial risk”\nthat the harm will occur, which may prompt plaintiffs to reasonably\nincur costs to mitigate or avoid that harm. Monsanto Co. v. Geertson\nSeed Farms, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 11–12). See also\nPennell v. City of San Jose, 485 U. S. 1, 8 (1988); Blum v. Yaretsky, 457\n16         CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n  Respondents’ alternative argument—namely, that they\ncan establish standing based on the measures that they\nhave undertaken to avoid §1881a-authorized surveil-\nlance—fares no better. Respondents assert that they are\nsuffering ongoing injuries that are fairly traceable to\n§1881a because the risk of surveillance under §1881a\nrequires them to take costly and burdensome measures to\nprotect the confidentiality of their communications. Re-\nspondents claim, for instance, that the threat of surveil-\nlance sometimes compels them to avoid certain e-mail and\nphone conversations, to “tal[k] in generalities rather than\nspecifics,” or to travel so that they can have in-person\nconversations. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38; App. to Pet. for Cert.\n338a, 345a, 367a, 400a.6 The Second Circuit panel con-\ncluded that, because respondents are already suffering\nsuch ongoing injuries, the likelihood of interception under\n§1881a is relevant only to the question whether respond-\nents’ ongoing injuries are “fairly traceable” to §1881a. See\n——————\nU. S. 991, 1000–1001 (1982); Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289,\n298 (1979). But to the extent that the “substantial risk” standard is\nrelevant and is distinct from the “clearly impending” requirement,\nrespondents fall short of even that standard, in light of the attenuated\nchain of inferences necessary to find harm here. See supra, at 11–15.\nIn addition, plaintiffs bear the burden of pleading and proving concrete\nfacts showing that the defendant’s actual action has caused the sub-\nstantial risk of harm. Plaintiffs cannot rely on speculation about “ ‘the\nunfettered choices made by independent actors not before the court.’ ”\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 562.\n   6 For all the focus on respondents’ supposed need to travel abroad in\n\nlight of potential §1881a surveillance, respondents cite only one specific\ninstance of travel: an attorney’s trip to New York City to meet with\nother lawyers. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 352a. This domestic travel\nhad but a tenuous connection to §1881a, because §1881a-authorized\nacquisitions “may not intentionally target any person known at the\ntime of acquisition to be located in the United States.” §1881a(b)(1); see\nalso 667 F. 3d 163, 202 (CA2 2011) (Jacobs, C. J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc); id., at 185 (opinion of Raggi, J. (same)).\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n638 F. 3d, at 133–134; 667 F. 3d, at 180 (opinion of Raggi,\nJ.). Analyzing the “fairly traceable” element of standing\nunder a relaxed reasonableness standard, see 638 F. 3d, at\n133–134, the Second Circuit then held that “plaintiffs\nhave established that they suffered present injuries in\nfact—economic and professional harms—stemming from a\nreasonable fear of future harmful government conduct,”\nid., at 138.\n   The Second Circuit’s analysis improperly allowed re-\nspondents to establish standing by asserting that they\nsuffer present costs and burdens that are based on a fear\nof surveillance, so long as that fear is not “fanciful, para-\nnoid, or otherwise unreasonable.” See id., at 134. This\nimproperly waters down the fundamental requirements of\nArticle III. Respondents’ contention that they have stand-\ning because they incurred certain costs as a reasonable\nreaction to a risk of harm is unavailing—because the harm\nrespondents seek to avoid is not certainly impending. In\nother words, respondents cannot manufacture standing\nmerely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their\nfears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly\nimpending. See Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U. S.\n660, 664 (1976) (per curiam); National Family Planning &\nReproductive Health Assn., Inc., 468 F. 3d 826, 831 (CADC\n2006). Any ongoing injuries that respondents are suffer-\ning are not fairly traceable to §1881a.\n   If the law were otherwise, an enterprising plaintiff\nwould be able to secure a lower standard for Article III\nstanding simply by making an expenditure based on a\nnonparanoid fear. As Judge Raggi accurately noted, under\nthe Second Circuit panel’s reasoning, respondents could,\n“for the price of a plane ticket, . . . transform their stand-\ning burden from one requiring a showing of actual or\nimminent . . . interception to one requiring a showing that\ntheir subjective fear of such interception is not fanciful,\nirrational, or clearly unreasonable.” 667 F. 3d, at 180\n18         CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, allowing re-\nspondents to bring this action based on costs they incurred\nin response to a speculative threat would be tantamount\nto accepting a repackaged version of respondents’ first\nfailed theory of standing. See ACLU, 493 F. 3d, at 656–\n657 (opinion of Batchelder, J.).\n   Another reason that respondents’ present injuries are\nnot fairly traceable to §1881a is that even before §1881a\nwas enacted, they had a similar incentive to engage in\nmany of the countermeasures that they are now taking.\nSee id., at 668–670. For instance, respondent Scott\nMcKay’s declaration describes—and the dissent heavily\nrelies on—Mr. McKay’s “knowledge” that thousands of\ncommunications involving one of his clients were moni-\ntored in the past. App. to Pet. for Cert. 370a; post, at 4,\n7–8. But this surveillance was conducted pursuant to FISA\nauthority that predated §1881a. See Brief for Petitioners\n32, n. 11; Al-Kidd v. Gonzales, No. 05–cv–93, 2008 WL\n5123009 (D Idaho, Dec. 4, 2008). Thus, because the Gov-\nernment was allegedly conducting surveillance of Mr.\nMcKay’s client before Congress enacted §1881a, it is diffi-\ncult to see how the safeguards that Mr. McKay now claims\nto have implemented can be traced to §1881a.\n   Because respondents do not face a threat of certainly\nimpending interception under §1881a, the costs that they\nhave incurred to avoid surveillance are simply the product\nof their fear of surveillance,7 and our decision in Laird\n\n——————\n  7 Although respondents’ alternative theory of standing rests primarily\n\non choices that they have made based on their subjective fear of surveil-\nlance, respondents also assert that third parties might be disinclined to\nspeak with them due to a fear of surveillance. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n372a–373a, 352a–353a. To the extent that such assertions are based on\nanything other than conjecture, see Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at\n560, they do not establish injury that is fairly traceable to §1881a,\nbecause they are based on third parties’ subjective fear of surveillance,\nsee Laird, 408 U. S., at 10–14.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmakes it clear that such a fear is insufficient to create\nstanding. See 408 U. S., at 10–15. The plaintiffs in Laird\nargued that their exercise of First Amendment rights was\nbeing “chilled by the mere existence, without more, of [the\nArmy’s] investigative and data-gathering activity.” Id., at\n10. While acknowledging that prior cases had held that\nconstitutional violations may arise from the chilling\neffect of “regulations that fall short of a direct prohibi-\ntion against the exercise of First Amendment rights,” the\nCourt declared that none of those cases involved a\n“chilling effect aris[ing] merely from the individual’s\nknowledge that a governmental agency was engaged in\ncertain activities or from the individual’s concomitant fear\nthat, armed with the fruits of those activities, the agency\nmight in the future take some other and additional action\ndetrimental to that individual.” Id., at 11. Because\n“[a]llegations of a subjective ‘chill’ are not an adequate\nsubstitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or\na threat of specific future harm,” id., at 13–14, the plain-\ntiffs in Laird—and respondents here—lack standing. See\nibid.; ACLU, supra, at 661–662 (opinion of Batchelder, J.)\n(holding that plaintiffs lacked standing because they\n“allege[d] only a subjective apprehension” of alleged NSA\nsurveillance and “a personal (self-imposed) unwillingness\nto communicate”); United Presbyterian Church, 738 F. 2d,\nat 1378 (holding that plaintiffs lacked standing to chal-\nlenge the legality of an Executive Order relating to sur-\nveillance because “the ‘chilling effect’ which is produced by\ntheir fear of being subjected to illegal surveillance and\nwhich deters them from conducting constitutionally pro-\ntected activities, is foreclosed as a basis for standing” by\nLaird).\n   For the reasons discussed above, respondents’ self-\ninflicted injuries are not fairly traceable to the Govern-\nment’s purported activities under §1881a, and their\nsubjective fear of surveillance does not give rise to standing.\n20       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              IV \n\n                               A\n\n  Respondents incorrectly maintain that “[t]he kinds of\ninjuries incurred here—injuries incurred because of [re-\nspondents’] reasonable efforts to avoid greater injuries\nthat are otherwise likely to flow from the conduct they\nchallenge—are the same kinds of injuries that this Court\nheld to support standing in cases such as” Laidlaw, Meese\nv. Keene, 481 U. S. 465 (1987), and Monsanto. Brief for\nRespondents 24. As an initial matter, none of these cases\nholds or even suggests that plaintiffs can establish stand-\ning simply by claiming that they experienced a “chilling\neffect” that resulted from a governmental policy that does\nnot regulate, constrain, or compel any action on their part.\nMoreover, each of these cases was very different from the\npresent case.\n  In Laidlaw, plaintiffs’ standing was based on “the prop-\nosition that a company’s continuous and pervasive illegal\ndischarges of pollutants into a river would cause nearby\nresidents to curtail their recreational use of that waterway\nand would subject them to other economic and aesthetic\nharms.” 528 U. S., at 184. Because the unlawful dis-\ncharges of pollutants were “concededly ongoing,” the only\nissue was whether “nearby residents”—who were mem-\nbers of the organizational plaintiffs—acted reasonably in\nrefraining from using the polluted area. Id., at 183–184.\nLaidlaw is therefore quite unlike the present case, in\nwhich it is not “concede[d]” that respondents would be\nsubject to unlawful surveillance but for their decision to\ntake preventive measures. See ACLU, 493 F. 3d, at 686\n(opinion of Batchelder, J.) (distinguishing Laidlaw on this\nground); id., at 689–690 (Gibbons, J., concurring) (same);\n667 F. 3d, at 182–183 (opinion of Raggi, J.) (same).\nLaidlaw would resemble this case only if (1) it were\nundisputed that the Government was using §1881a-\nauthorized surveillance to acquire respondents’ communi-\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncations and (2) the sole dispute concerned the reasonable-\nness of respondents’ preventive measures.\n    In Keene, the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of\nthe Government’s decision to label three films as “political\npropaganda.” 481 U. S., at 467. The Court held that the\nplaintiff, who was an attorney and a state legislator, had\nstanding because he demonstrated, through “detailed\naffidavits,” that he “could not exhibit the films without\nincurring a risk of injury to his reputation and of an im-\npairment of his political career.” Id., at 467, 473–475.\nUnlike the present case, Keene involved “more than a\n‘subjective chill’ ” based on speculation about potential\ngovernmental action; the plaintiff in that case was un-\nquestionably regulated by the relevant statute, and the\nfilms that he wished to exhibit had already been labeled\nas “political propaganda.” See ibid.; ACLU, 493 F. 3d, at\n663–664 (opinion of Batchelder, J.); id., at 691 (Gibbons,\nJ., concurring).\n    Monsanto, on which respondents also rely, is likewise\ninapposite. In Monsanto, conventional alfalfa farmers had\nstanding to seek injunctive relief because the agency’s\ndecision to deregulate a variety of genetically engineered\nalfalfa gave rise to a “significant risk of gene flow to\nnon-genetically-engineered varieties of alfalfa.” 561 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 13). The standing analysis in that case\nhinged on evidence that genetically engineered alfalfa\n“ ‘seed fields [we]re currently being planted in all the\nmajor alfalfa seed production areas’ ”; the bees that polli-\nnate alfalfa “ ‘have a range of at least two to ten miles’ ”;\nand the alfalfa seed farms were concentrated in an area\nwell within the bees’ pollination range. Id., at ___–___,\nand n. 3 (slip op., at 11–12, and n. 3). Unlike the conven-\ntional alfalfa farmers in Monsanto, however, respondents\nin the present case present no concrete evidence to sub-\nstantiate their fears, but instead rest on mere conjecture\nabout possible governmental actions.\n22         CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n  Respondents also suggest that they should be held to\nhave standing because otherwise the constitutionality\nof §1881a could not be challenged. It would be wrong,\nthey maintain, to “insulate the government’s surveillance\nactivities from meaningful judicial review.” Brief for\nRespondents 60. Respondents’ suggestion is both legally\nand factually incorrect. First, “ ‘[t]he assumption that if\nrespondents have no standing to sue, no one would have\nstanding, is not a reason to find standing.’ ” Valley Forge\nChristian College, 454 U. S., at 489; Schlesinger, 418 U. S.,\nat 227; see also Richardson, 418 U. S., at 179; Raines, 521\nU. S., at 835 (Souter, J., joined by GINSBURG, J., concur-\nring in judgment).\n  Second, our holding today by no means insulates §1881a\nfrom judicial review.      As described above, Congress\ncreated a comprehensive scheme in which the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court evaluates the Government’s\ncertifications, targeting procedures, and minimization\nprocedures—including assessing whether the targeting\nand minimization procedures comport with the Fourth\nAmendment. §§1881a(a), (c)(1), (i)(2), (i)(3). Any dissatis-\nfaction that respondents may have about the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court’s rulings—or the congres-\nsional delineation of that court’s role—is irrelevant to our\nstanding analysis.\n  Additionally, if the Government intends to use or dis-\nclose information obtained or derived from a §1881a ac-\nquisition in judicial or administrative proceedings, it\nmust provide advance notice of its intent, and the affected\nperson may challenge the lawfulness of the acquisition.\n§§1806(c), 1806(e), 1881e(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. V).8\n——————\n 8 The possibility of judicial review in this context is not farfetched. In\n\nUnited States v. Damrah, 412 F. 3d 618 (CA6 2005), for example, the\nGovernment made a pretrial disclosure that it intended to use FISA\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                23\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nThus, if the Government were to prosecute one of\nrespondent-attorney’s foreign clients using §1881a-authorized\nsurveillance, the Government would be required to make a\ndisclosure. Although the foreign client might not have a\nviable Fourth Amendment claim, see, e.g., United States v.\nVerdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 261 (1990), it is possible\nthat the monitoring of the target’s conversations with his\nor her attorney would provide grounds for a claim of\nstanding on the part of the attorney. Such an attorney\nwould certainly have a stronger evidentiary basis for\nestablishing standing than do respondents in the present\ncase. In such a situation, unlike in the present case,\nit would at least be clear that the Government had ac-\nquired the foreign client’s communications using §1881a-\nauthorized surveillance.\n   Finally, any electronic communications service provider\nthat the Government directs to assist in §1881a surveil-\nlance may challenge the lawfulness of that directive before\nthe FISC. §§1881a(h)(4), (6). Indeed, at the behest of a\nservice provider, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nCourt of Review previously analyzed the constitutionality\nof electronic surveillance directives issued pursuant to a\nnow-expired set of FISA amendments. See In re Directives\nPursuant to Section 105B of Foreign Intelligence Surveil-\nlance Act, 551 F. 3d 1004, 1006–1016 (2008) (holding that\nthe provider had standing and that the directives were\nconstitutional).\n                     *   *     *\n  We hold that respondents lack Article III standing\nbecause they cannot demonstrate that the future injury\n——————\nevidence in a prosecution; the defendant (unsuccessfully) moved to\nsuppress the FISA evidence, even though he had not been the target of\nthe surveillance; and the Sixth Circuit ultimately held that FISA’s\nprocedures are consistent with the Fourth Amendment.

S. C. §1881a (2006 ed., Supp. V), will harm them by\nintercepting at least some of their private, foreign, tele­\nphone, or e-mail conversations. In my view, this harm is\nnot “speculative.” Indeed it is as likely to take place as are\nmost future events that commonsense inference and ordi­\nnary knowledge of human nature tell us will happen. This\nCourt has often found the occurrence of similar future\nevents sufficiently certain to support standing. I dissent\nfrom the Court’s contrary conclusion.\n                              I\n  Article III specifies that the “judicial Power” of the\nUnited States extends only to actual “Cases” and “Contro­\nversies.” §2. It thereby helps to ensure that the legal\nquestions presented to the federal courts will not take the\nform of abstract intellectual problems resolved in the\n“rarified atmosphere of a debating society” but instead\nthose questions will be presented “in a concrete factual\ncontext conducive to a realistic appreciation of the conse­\nquences of judicial action.” Valley Forge Christian College\n2        CLAPPER v.

S. 289, 297\n(1979) (similar).\n   The Court has recognized that the precise boundaries of\nthe “case or controversy” requirement are matters of “de­\ngree . . . not discernible by any precise test.” Ibid. At the\nsame time, the Court has developed a subsidiary set of\nlegal rules that help to determine when the Constitution’s\nrequirement is met. See Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560–561; id.,\nat 583 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Thus, a\nplaintiff must have “standing” to bring a legal claim. And\na plaintiff has that standing, the Court has said, only if\nthe action or omission that the plaintiff challenges has\ncaused, or will cause, the plaintiff to suffer an injury that\nis “concrete and particularized,” “actual or imminent,” and\n“redress[able] by a favorable decision.” Id., at 560–561\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   No one here denies that the Government’s interception\nof a private telephone or e-mail conversation amounts to\nan injury that is “concrete and particularized.” Moreover,\nthe plaintiffs, respondents here, seek as relief a judgment\ndeclaring unconstitutional (and enjoining enforcement of)\na statutory provision authorizing those interceptions; and,\nsuch a judgment would redress the injury by preventing it.\nThus, the basic question is whether the injury, i.e., the\ninterception, is “actual or imminent.”\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n  Since the plaintiffs fear interceptions of a kind author­\nized by §1881a, it is important to understand just what\nkind of surveillance that section authorizes. Congress\nenacted §1881a in 2008, as an amendment to the pre­\nexisting Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, 50\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. C. §1801 et seq. Before the amendment, the Act\nauthorized the Government (acting within the United\nStates) to monitor private electronic communications\nbetween the United States and a foreign country if (1) the\nGovernment’s purpose was, in significant part, to obtain\nforeign intelligence information (which includes infor­\nmation concerning a “foreign power” or “territory” related\nto our “national defense” or “security” or the “conduct of\n. . . foreign affairs”), (2) the Government’s surveillance\ntarget was “a foreign power or an agent of a foreign\npower,” and (3) the Government used surveillance proce­\ndures designed to “minimize the acquisition and retention, and\nprohibit the dissemination, of ” any private information\nacquired about Americans. §§1801(e), (h), 1804(a).\n    In addition the Government had to obtain the approval\nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. To do so, it\nhad to submit an application describing (1) each “specific\ntarget,” (2) the “nature of the information sought,” and (3)\nthe “type of communications or activities to be subjected\nto the surveillance.” §1804(a). It had to certify that, in\nsignificant part, it sought to obtain foreign intelligence\ninformation. Ibid. It had to demonstrate probable cause\nto believe that each specific target was “a foreign power or\nan agent of a foreign power.” §§1804(a), 1805(a). It also\nhad to describe instance-specific procedures to be used\nto minimize intrusions upon Americans’ privacy (compli­\nance with which the court subsequently could assess).\n§§1804(a), 1805(d)(3).\n    The addition of §1881a in 2008 changed this prior law in\nthree important ways. First, it eliminated the require­\nment that the Government describe to the court each\nspecific target and identify each facility at which its sur­\nveillance would be directed, thus permitting surveillance\non a programmatic, not necessarily individualized, basis.\n§1881a(g). Second, it eliminated the requirement that a\ntarget be a “foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.”\n4        CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nIbid.    Third, it diminished the court’s authority to\ninsist upon, and eliminated its authority to supervise,\ninstance-specific privacy-intrusion minimization procedures\n(though the Government still must use court-approved\ngeneral minimization procedures). §1881a(e). Thus, using\nthe authority of §1881a, the Government can obtain court\napproval for its surveillance of electronic communications\nbetween places within the United States and targets in\nforeign territories by showing the court (1) that “a sig­\nnificant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign\nintelligence information,” and (2) that it will use general\ntargeting and privacy-intrusion minimization procedures of\na kind that the court had previously approved. §1881a(g).\n                              B\n   It is similarly important to understand the kinds of\ncommunications in which the plaintiffs say they engage\nand which they believe the Government will intercept.\nPlaintiff Scott McKay, for example, says in an affidavit (1)\nthat he is a lawyer; (2) that he represented “Mr. Sami\nOmar Al-Hussayen, who was acquitted in June 2004 on\nterrorism charges”; (3) that he continues to represent “Mr.\nAl-Hussayen, who, in addition to facing criminal charges\nafter September 11, was named as a defendant in several\ncivil cases”; (4) that he represents Khalid Sheik Moham­\nmed, a detainee, “before the Military Commissions at\nGuantánamo Bay, Cuba”; (5) that in representing these\nclients he “communicate[s] by telephone and email with\npeople outside the United States, including Mr. Al-\nHussayen himself,” “experts, investigators, attorneys,\nfamily members . . . and others who are located abroad”;\nand (6) that prior to 2008 “the U. S. government had\nintercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and 20,000 email\ncommunications involving [his client] Al-Hussayen.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 369a–371a.\n   Another plaintiff, Sylvia Royce, says in her affidavit (1)\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat she is an attorney; (2) that she “represent[s] Mo­\nhammedou Ould Salahi, a prisoner who has been held at\nGuantánamo Bay as an enemy combatant”; (3) that, “[i]n\nconnection with [her] representation of Mr. Salahi, [she]\nreceive[s] calls from time to time from Mr. Salahi’s\nbrother, . . . a university student in Germany”; and (4)\nthat she has been told that the Government has threatened\nSalahi “that his family members would be arrested and mis­\ntreated if he did not cooperate.” Id., at 349a–351a.\n  The plaintiffs have noted that McKay no longer repre­\nsents Mohammed and Royce no longer represents Ould\nSalahi. Brief for Respondents 15, n. 11. But these changes\nare irrelevant, for we assess standing as of the time a\nsuit is filed, see Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n, 554\nU. S. 724, 734 (2008), and in any event McKay himself\ncontinues to represent Al Hussayen, his partner now\nrepresents Mohammed, and Royce continues to represent\nindividuals held in the custody of the U. S. military\noverseas.\n  A third plaintiff, Joanne Mariner, says in her affidavit\n(1) that she is a human rights researcher, (2) that “some of\nthe work [she] do[es] involves trying to track down people\nwho were rendered by the CIA to countries in which they\nwere tortured”; (3) that many of those people “the CIA has\nsaid are (or were) associated with terrorist organizations”;\nand (4) that, to do this research, she “communicate[s] by\ntelephone and e-mail with . . . former detainees, lawyers\nfor detainees, relatives of detainees, political activists,\njournalists, and fixers” “all over the world, including in\nJordan, Egypt, Pakistan, Afghanistan, [and] the Gaza\nStrip.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 343a–344a.\n  Other plaintiffs, including lawyers, journalists, and\nhuman rights researchers, say in affidavits (1) that they\nhave jobs that require them to gather information from\nforeigners located abroad; (2) that they regularly com­\nmunicate electronically (e.g., by telephone or e-mail) with\n6        CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nforeigners located abroad; and (3) that in these communi­\ncations they exchange “foreign intelligence information” as\nthe Act defines it. Id., at 334a–375a.\n                              III\n   Several considerations, based upon the record along\nwith commonsense inferences, convince me that there is a\nvery high likelihood that Government, acting under the\nauthority of §1881a, will intercept at least some of the\ncommunications just described. First, the plaintiffs have\nengaged, and continue to engage, in electronic communica­\ntions of a kind that the 2008 amendment, but not the prior\nAct, authorizes the Government to intercept. These com­\nmunications include discussions with family members of\nthose detained at Guantanamo, friends and acquaintances\nof those persons, and investigators, experts and others\nwith knowledge of circumstances related to terrorist activ­\nities. These persons are foreigners located outside the\nUnited States. They are not “foreign power[s]” or “agent[s]\nof . . . foreign power[s].” And the plaintiffs state that they\nexchange with these persons “foreign intelligence infor­\nmation,” defined to include information that “relates to”\n“international terrorism” and “the national defense or the\nsecurity of the United States.” See 50 U. S. C. §1801 (2006\ned. and Supp. V); see, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 342a,\n366a, 373a–374a.\n   Second, the plaintiffs have a strong motive to engage in,\nand the Government has a strong motive to listen to,\nconversations of the kind described. A lawyer represent­\ning a client normally seeks to learn the circumstances\nsurrounding the crime (or the civil wrong) of which the\nclient is accused. A fair reading of the affidavit of Scott\nMcKay, for example, taken together with elementary\nconsiderations of a lawyer’s obligation to his client, indi­\ncates that McKay will engage in conversations that con­\ncern what suspected foreign terrorists, such as his client,\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhave done; in conversations that concern his clients’ fami­\nlies, colleagues, and contacts; in conversations that con­\ncern what those persons (or those connected to them) have\nsaid and done, at least in relation to terrorist activities; in\nconversations that concern the political, social, and com­\nmercial environments in which the suspected terrorists\nhave lived and worked; and so forth. See, e.g., id., at\n373a–374a. Journalists and human rights workers have\nstrong similar motives to conduct conversations of this\nkind. See, e.g., id., at 342a (Declaration of Joanne Mari­\nner, stating that “some of the information [she] ex­\nchange[s] by telephone and e-mail relates to terrorism and\ncounterterrorism, and much of the information relates to\nthe foreign affairs of the United States”).\n   At the same time, the Government has a strong motive\nto conduct surveillance of conversations that contain\nmaterial of this kind. The Government, after all, seeks to\nlearn as much as it can reasonably learn about suspected\nterrorists (such as those detained at Guantanamo), as well\nas about their contacts and activities, along with those of\nfriends and family members. See Executive Office of the\nPresident, Office of Management and Budget, Statement\nof Administration Policy on S. 2248, p. 4 (Dec. 17, 2007)\n(“Part of the value of the [new authority] is to enable the\nIntelligence Community to collect expeditiously the com­\nmunications of terrorists in foreign countries who may\ncontact an associate in the United States”). And the Gov­\nernment is motivated to do so, not simply by the desire to\nhelp convict those whom the Government believes guilty,\nbut also by the critical, overriding need to protect America\nfrom terrorism. See id., at 1 (“Protection of the American\npeople and American interests at home and abroad re­\nquires access to timely, accurate, and insightful intelli­\ngence on the capabilities, intentions, and activities of . . .\nterrorists”).\n   Third, the Government’s past behavior shows that it has\n8        CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsought, and hence will in all likelihood continue to seek,\ninformation about alleged terrorists and detainees\nthrough means that include surveillance of electronic\ncommunications. As just pointed out, plaintiff Scott\nMcKay states that the Government (under the authority of\nthe pre-2008 law) “intercepted some 10,000 telephone calls\nand 20,000 email communications involving [his client]\nMr. Al-Hussayen.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 370a.\n   Fourth, the Government has the capacity to conduct\nelectronic surveillance of the kind at issue. To some de­\ngree this capacity rests upon technology available to the\nGovernment. See 1 D. Kris & J. Wilson, National Security\nInvestigations & Prosecutions §16:6, p. 562 (2d ed. 2012)\n(“NSA’s technological abilities are legendary”); id., §16:12,\nat 572–577 (describing the National Security Agency’s\ncapacity to monitor “very broad facilities” such as interna­\ntional switches). See, e.g., Lichtblau & Risen, Spy Agency\nMined Vast Data Trove, Officials Report, N. Y. Times, Dec.\n24, 2005, p. A1 (describing capacity to trace and to analyze\nlarge volumes of communications into and out of the\nUnited States); Lichtblau & Shane, Bush is Pressed Over New\nReport on Surveillance, N. Y. Times, May 12, 2006, p. A1\n(reporting capacity to obtain access to records of many, if\nnot most, telephone calls made in the United States);\nPriest & Arkin, A Hidden World, Growing Beyond Control,\nWashington Post, July 19, 2010, p. A1 (reporting that\nevery day, collection systems at the National Security\nAgency intercept and store 1.7 billion e-mails, telephone\ncalls and other types of communications). Cf. Statement\nof Administration Policy on S. 2248, supra, at 3 (rejecting\na provision of the Senate bill that would require intelli­\ngence analysts to count “the number of persons located in\nthe United States whose communications were reviewed”\nas “impossible to implement” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). This capacity also includes the Government’s\nauthority to obtain the kind of information here at issue\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfrom private carriers such as AT&T and Verizon. See 50\nU. S. C. §1881a(h). We are further told by amici that the\nGovernment is expanding that capacity. See Brief for\nElectronic Privacy Information Center et al. as 22–23\n(National Security Agency will be able to conduct surveil­\nlance of most electronic communications between domestic\nand foreign points).\n   Of course, to exercise this capacity the Government\nmust have intelligence court authorization. But the Gov­\nernment rarely files requests that fail to meet the statu­\ntory criteria. See Letter from Ronald Weich, Assistant\nAttorney General, to Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 1 (Apr. 30,\n2012) (In 2011, of the 1,676 applications to the intelligence\ncourt, two were withdrawn by the Government, and the\nremaining 1,674 were approved, 30 with some mod­\nification),   online    at     http://www.justice.gov/nsd/foia/\nfoia_library/2011fisa-ltr.pdf. (as visited Feb. 22, 2013, and\navailable in Clerk of Court’s case file). As the intelligence\ncourt itself has stated, its review under §1881a is “nar­\nrowly circumscribed.” In re Proceedings Required by §702(i)\nof the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, No. Misc. 08–01\n(Aug. 17, 2008), p. 3. There is no reason to believe that\nthe communications described would all fail to meet the\nconditions necessary for approval. Moreover, compared\nwith prior law, §1881a simplifies and thus expedites the\napproval process, making it more likely that the Govern­\nment will use §1881a to obtain the necessary approval.\n   The upshot is that (1) similarity of content, (2) strong\nmotives, (3) prior behavior, and (4) capacity all point to a\nvery strong likelihood that the Government will intercept\nat least some of the plaintiffs’ communications, including\nsome that the 2008 amendment, §1881a, but not the pre­\n2008 Act, authorizes the Government to intercept.\n   At the same time, nothing suggests the presence of some\nspecial factor here that might support a contrary conclu­\nsion. The Government does not deny that it has both the\n10       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmotive and the capacity to listen to communications of the\nkind described by plaintiffs. Nor does it describe any\nsystem for avoiding the interception of an electronic com­\nmunication that happens to include a party who is an\nAmerican lawyer, journalist, or human rights worker.\nOne can, of course, always imagine some special circum­\nstance that negates a virtual likelihood, no matter how\nstrong. But the same is true about most, if not all, ordi­\nnary inferences about future events. Perhaps, despite\npouring rain, the streets will remain dry (due to the pres­\nence of a special chemical). But ordinarily a party that\nseeks to defeat a strong natural inference must bear the\nburden of showing that some such special circumstance\nexists. And no one has suggested any such special circum­\nstance here.\n  Consequently, we need only assume that the Govern­\nment is doing its job (to find out about, and combat, terror­\nism) in order to conclude that there is a high probability\nthat the Government will intercept at least some elec­\ntronic communication to which at least some of the plaintiffs\nare parties. The majority is wrong when it describes the\nharm threatened plaintiffs as “speculative.”\n                               IV \n\n                                A\n\n   The majority more plausibly says that the plaintiffs\nhave failed to show that the threatened harm is “certainly\nimpending.” Ante, at 10 (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). But, as the majority appears to concede, see ante, at\n15–16, and n. 5, certainty is not, and never has been, the\ntouchstone of standing. The future is inherently uncer­\ntain. Yet federal courts frequently entertain actions for\ninjunctions and for declaratory relief aimed at preventing\nfuture activities that are reasonably likely or highly likely,\nbut not absolutely certain, to take place. And that degree\nof certainty is all that is needed to support standing here.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court’s use of the term “certainly impending” is not\nto the contrary. Sometimes the Court has used the phrase\n“certainly impending” as if the phrase described a suffi-\ncient, rather than a necessary, condition for jurisdiction.\nSee Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553, 593\n(1923) (“If the injury is certainly impending that is\nenough”). See also Babbitt, 442 U. S., at 298 (same). On\nother occasions, it has used the phrase as if it concerned\nwhen, not whether, an alleged injury would occur. Thus,\nin Lujan, 504 U. S., at 564, n. 2, the Court considered a\nthreatened future injury that consisted of harm that\nplaintiffs would suffer when they “soon” visited a gov­\nernment project area that (they claimed) would suffer\nenvironmental damage. The Court wrote that a “mere pro­\nfession of an intent, some day, to return” to the project area\ndid not show the harm was “imminent,” for “soon” might\nmean nothing more than “in this lifetime.” Id., at 564–\n565, n. 2 (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly,\nin McConnell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93\n(2003), the Court denied standing because the Senator’s\nfuture injury (stemming from a campaign finance law)\nwould not affect him until his reelection. That fact, the\nCourt said, made the injury “too remote temporally to\nsatisfy Article III standing.” Id., at 225–226.\n   On still other occasions, recognizing that “ ‘ imminence’\nis concededly a somewhat elastic concept,” Lujan, supra,\nat 565, n. 2, the Court has referred to, or used (sometimes\nalong with “certainly impending”) other phrases such as\n“reasonable probability” that suggest less than absolute,\nor literal certainty. See Babbitt, supra, at 298 (plaintiff\n“must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct\ninjury” (emphasis added)); Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.\nLaidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.

Taken together the case law uses the word “certain­\nly” as if it emphasizes, rather than literally defines, the\nimmediately following term “impending.”\n                              B\n                              1\n   More important, the Court’s holdings in standing cases\nshow that standing exists here. The Court has often found\nstanding where the occurrence of the relevant injury was\nfar less certain than here. Consider a few, fairly typical,\ncases. Consider Pennell, supra. A city ordinance forbade\nlandlords to raise the rent charged to a tenant by more\nthan 8 percent where doing so would work an unreasona­\nbly severe hardship on that tenant. Id., at 4–5. A group of\nlandlords sought a judgment declaring the ordinance\nunconstitutional. The Court held that, to have standing,\nthe landlords had to demonstrate a “ ‘realistic danger of\nsustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute’s opera­\ntion.’ ” Id., at 8 (emphasis added). It found that the land­\nlords had done so by showing a likelihood of enforcement\nand a “probability,” ibid., that the ordinance would make\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe landlords charge lower rents—even though the land­\nlords had not shown (1) that they intended to raise the\nrelevant rents to the point of causing unreasonably severe\nhardship; (2) that the tenants would challenge those in­\ncreases; or (3) that the city’s hearing examiners and arbi­\ntrators would find against the landlords. Here, even more\nso than in Pennell, there is a “realistic danger” that the\nrelevant harm will occur.\n   Or, consider Blum, supra. A group of nursing home\nresidents receiving Medicaid benefits challenged the con­\nstitutionality (on procedural grounds) of a regulation that\npermitted their nursing home to transfer them to a less\ndesirable home. Id., at 999–1000. Although a Medicaid\ncommittee had recommended transfers, Medicaid-initiated\ntransfer had been enjoined and the nursing home itself\nhad not threatened to transfer the plaintiffs. But the\nCourt found “standing” because “the threat of transfers”\nwas “not ‘imaginary or speculative’ ” but “quite realistic,”\nhence “sufficiently substantial.” Id., at 1000–1001 (quot­\ning Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 42 (1971)). The plain­\ntiffs’ injury here is not imaginary or speculative, but “quite\nrealistic.”\n   Or, consider Davis, supra. The plaintiff, a candidate for\nthe United States House of Representatives, self-financed\nhis campaigns. He challenged the constitutionality of an\nelection law that relaxed the limits on an opponent’s con­\ntributions when a self-financed candidate’s spending itself\nexceeded certain other limits. His opponent, in fact, had\ndecided not to take advantage of the increased contribu­\ntion limits that the statute would have allowed. Id., at\n734. But the Court nonetheless found standing because\nthere was a “realistic and impending threat,” not a cer­\ntainty, that the candidate’s opponent would do so at the\ntime the plaintiff filed the complaint. Id., at 734–735.\nThe threat facing the plaintiffs here is as “realistic and\nimpending.”\n14       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Or, consider MedImmune, supra. The plaintiff, a patent\nlicensee, sought a declaratory judgment that the patent\nwas invalid. But, the plaintiff did not face an imminent\nthreat of suit because it continued making royalty pay­\nments to the patent holder. In explaining why the plain­\ntiff had standing, we (1) assumed that if the plaintiff\nstopped making royalty payments it would have standing\n(despite the fact that the patent holder might not bring\nsuit), (2) rejected the Federal Circuit’s “reasonable ap­\nprehension of imminent suit” requirement, and (3) in­\nstead suggested that a “genuine threat of enforcement” was\nlikely sufficient. Id., at 128, 129, 132, n. 11 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). A “genuine threat” is present\nhere.\n   Moreover, courts have often found probabilistic injuries\nsufficient to support standing. In Duke Power Co. v. Caro-\nlina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59 (1978),\nfor example, the plaintiffs, a group of individuals living\nnear a proposed nuclear powerplant, challenged the con­\nstitutionality of the Price-Anderson Act, a statute that\nlimited the plant’s liability in the case of a nuclear acci­\ndent. The plaintiffs said that, without the Act, the de­\nfendants would not build a nuclear plant. And the building\nof the plant would harm them, in part, by emitting\n“non-natural radiation into [their] environment.” Id., at\n74. The Court found standing in part due to “our general­\nized concern about exposure to radiation and the appre­\nhension flowing from the uncertainty about the health and\ngenetic consequences of even small emissions.” Ibid.\n(emphasis added). See also Monsanto Co., supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 11–12) (“A substantial risk of gene flow injures\nrespondents in several ways” (emphasis added)).\n   See also lower court cases, such as Mountain States\nLegal Foundation v.

C., Inc., 419 F. 3d 568, 570–575 (CA6\n2005) (standing based on increased risk of harm caused by\nimplantation of defective medical device); Johnson v.\nAllsteel, Inc., 259 F. 3d 885, 888–891 (CA7 2001) (stand­\ning based on increased risk that Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act beneficiary will not be covered due\nto increased amount of discretion given to ERISA\nadministrator).\n   How could the law be otherwise? Suppose that a federal\ncourt faced a claim by homeowners that (allegedly) unlaw­\nful dam-building practices created a high risk that their\nhomes would be flooded. Would the court deny them\nstanding on the ground that the risk of flood was only 60,\nrather than 90, percent?\n   Would federal courts deny standing to a plaintiff in a\ndiversity action who claims an anticipatory breach of\ncontract where the future breach depends on probabilities?\nThe defendant, say, has threatened to load wheat onto a\nship bound for India despite a promise to send the wheat\nto the United States. No one can know for certain that\nthis will happen. Perhaps the defendant will change his\nmind; perhaps the ship will turn and head for the United\nStates. Yet, despite the uncertainty, the Constitution does\nnot prohibit a federal court from hearing such a claim.\nSee 23 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §63:35 (4th ed.\n2002) (plaintiff may bring an anticipatory breach suit even\nthough the defendant’s promise is one to perform in the\nfuture, it has not yet been broken, and defendant may still\n16       CLAPPER v.

Century Indemnity Co., 130 F. 3d 787, 792–793\n(CA7 1997) (plaintiff could sue insurer that disclaimed\nliability for all costs that would be incurred in the future if\nenvironmental agencies required cleanup); Combs v. In-\nternational Ins. Co., 354 F. 3d 568, 598–601 (CA6 2004)\n(similar).\n   Would federal courts deny standing to a plaintiff who\nseeks to enjoin as a nuisance the building of a nearby pond\nwhich, the plaintiff believes, will very likely, but not inevi­\ntably, overflow his land? See 42 Am. Jur. 2d Injunctions\n§§2, 5 (2010) (noting that an injunction is ordinarily pre­\nventive in character and restrains actions that have not\nyet been taken, but threaten injury). E.g., Central Delta\nWater Agency v. United States, 306 F. 3d 938, 947–950\n(CA9 2002) (standing to seek injunction where method of\noperating dam was highly likely to severely hamper plain­\ntiffs’ ability to grow crops); Consolidated Companies, Inc.\nv. Union Pacific R. Co., 499 F. 3d 382, 386 (CA5 2007)\n(standing to seek injunction requiring cleanup of land\nadjacent to plaintiff ’s tract because of threat that contam­\ninants might migrate to plaintiff ’s tract).\n   Neither do ordinary declaratory judgment actions al­\nways involve the degree of certainty upon which the Court\ninsists here. See, e.g., Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific\nCoal & Oil Co., 312 U. S. 270, 273 (1941) (insurance com­\npany could seek declaration that it need not pay claim\nagainst insured automobile driver who was in an accident\neven though the driver had not yet been found liable for\nthe accident); Aetna Life Ins.

See\nalso, e.g., Associated Indemnity Corp. v.

S. ____ (2013)            17\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nity even before insured found liable).\n                               2\n   In some standing cases, the Court has found that a\nreasonable probability of future injury comes accompanied\nwith present injury that takes the form of reasonable\nefforts to mitigate the threatened effects of the future\ninjury or to prevent it from occurring. Thus, in Monsanto\nCo., 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11–14) plaintiffs, a group\nof conventional alfalfa growers, challenged an agency\ndecision to deregulate genetically engineered alfalfa. They\nclaimed that deregulation would harm them because their\nneighbors would plant the genetically engineered seed,\nbees would obtain pollen from the neighbors’ plants, and\nthe bees would then (harmfully) contaminate their own\nconventional alfalfa with the genetically modified gene.\nThe lower courts had found a “reasonable probability” that\nthis injury would occur. Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Without expressing views about that probability, we\nfound standing because the plaintiffs would suffer present\nharm by trying to combat the threat. Ibid. The plaintiffs,\nfor example, “would have to conduct testing to find out\nwhether and to what extent their crops have been contam­\ninated.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12). And they would have\nto take “measures to minimize the likelihood of potential\ncontamination and to ensure an adequate supply of\nnon-genetically-engineered alfalfa.” Ibid. We held that these\n“harms, which [the plaintiffs] will suffer even if their crops\nare not actually infected with” the genetically modified\ngene, “are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact\nprong of the constitutional standing analysis.” Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 13).\n   Virtually identical circumstances are present here.\nPlaintiff McKay, for example, points out that, when he\ncommunicates abroad about, or in the interests of, a client\n18       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(e.g., a client accused of terrorism), he must “make an\nassessment” whether his “client’s interests would be com­\npromised” should the Government “acquire the communi­\ncations.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a. If so, he must either\nforgo the communication or travel abroad. Id., at 371a–\n372a (“I have had to take measures to protect the confi­\ndentiality of information that I believe is particularly\nsensitive,” including “travel that is both time-consuming\nand expensive”).\n    Since travel is expensive, since forgoing communication\ncan compromise the client’s interests, since McKay’s as­\nsessment itself takes time and effort, this case does not\ndiffer significantly from Monsanto. And that is so whether\nwe consider the plaintiffs’ present necessary expenditure\nof time and effort as a separate concrete, particularized,\nimminent harm, or consider it as additional evidence that\nthe future harm (an interception) is likely to occur. See\nalso Friends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U. S., at 183–184 (hold­\ning that plaintiffs who curtailed their recreational activi­\nties on a river due to reasonable concerns about the effect\nof pollutant discharges into that river had standing);\nMeese v. Keene, 481 U. S. 465, 475 (1987) (stating that “the\nneed to take . . . affirmative steps to avoid the risk of harm\n. . . constitutes a cognizable injury”).\n                             3\n  The majority cannot find support in cases that use the\nwords “certainly impending” to deny standing. While I do\nnot claim to have read every standing case, I have exam­\nined quite a few, and not yet found any such case. The\nmajority refers to Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149\n(1990). But in that case the Court denied standing to a\nprisoner who challenged the validity of a death sentence\ngiven to a different prisoner who refused to challenge his\nown sentence. The plaintiff feared that in the absence of\nan appeal, his fellow prisoner’s death sentence would be\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmissing from the State’s death penalty database and\nthereby skew the database against him, making it less\nlikely his challenges to his own death penalty would suc­\nceed. The Court found no standing. Id., at 161. But the\nfellow prisoner’s lack of appeal would have harmed the\nplaintiff only if (1) the plaintiff separately obtained federal\nhabeas relief and was then reconvicted and resentenced to\ndeath, (2) he sought review of his new sentence, and (3)\nduring that review, his death sentence was affirmed only\nbecause it was compared to an artificially skewed data­\nbase. Id., at 156–157. These events seemed not very\nlikely to occur.\n   In DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332 (2006),\ntaxpayers challenged the constitutionality of a tax break\noffered by state and local governments to a car manufac­\nturer. We found no standing. But the plaintiffs would\nhave suffered resulting injury only if that the tax break\nhad depleted state and local treasuries and the legislature\nhad responded by raising their taxes. Id., at 344.\n   In Lujan, the case that may come closest to supporting\nthe majority, the Court also found no standing. But, as I\npointed out, supra, at 11, Lujan is a case where the Court\nconsidered when, not whether, the threatened harm would\noccur. 504 U. S., at 564, n. 2. The relevant injury there\nconsisted of a visit by environmental group’s members to a\nproject site where they would find (unlawful) environmen­\ntal depredation. Id., at 564. The Court pointed out that\nmembers had alleged that they would visit the project\nsites “soon.” But it wrote that “soon” might refer to almost\nany time in the future. Ibid., n. 2. By way of contrast, the\nongoing threat of terrorism means that here the relevant\ninterceptions will likely take place imminently, if not now.\n   The Court has, of course, denied standing in other cases.\nBut they involve injuries less likely, not more likely, to\noccur than here. In a recent case, Summers v. Earth\nIsland Institute, 555 U. S. 488 (2009), for example, the\n20       CLAPPER v. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nplaintiffs challenged a regulation exempting certain tim­\nber sales from public comment and administrative appeal.\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the regulations injured them\nby interfering with their esthetic enjoyment and recrea­\ntional use of the forests. The Court found this harm too\nunlikely to occur to support standing. Id., at 496. The\nCourt noted that one plaintiff had not pointed to a specific\naffected forest that he would visit. The Court concluded\nthat “[t]here may be a chance, but . . . hardly a likelihood,”\nthat the plaintiff ’s “wanderings will bring him to a parcel\nabout to be affected by a project unlawfully subject to the\nregulations.” Id., at 495 (emphasis added).\n                              4\n  In sum, as the Court concedes, see ante, at 15–16, and\nn. 5, the word “certainly” in the phrase “certainly impend­\ning” does not refer to absolute certainty. As our case law\ndemonstrates, what the Constitution requires is some­\nthing more akin to “reasonable probability” or “high prob­\nability.” The use of some such standard is all that is\nnecessary here to ensure the actual concrete injury that\nthe Constitution demands. The considerations set forth in\nParts II and III, supra, make clear that the standard is\nreadily met in this case.\n                         *    *     *\n  While I express no view on the merits of the plaintiffs’\nconstitutional claims, I do believe that at least some of the\nplaintiffs have standing to make those claims. I dissent,\nwith respect, from the majority’s contrary conclusion.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/821306/", "sha1": "b2917cca08e589ccc48e7df3129906852cda060d", "source": "C", "time_retrieved": "2013-02-26T07:43:24.187702"}
