CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT\n          PLANS AND TRUST FUNDS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 11–1085. Argued November 5, 2012—Decided February 27, 2013\nTo recover damages in a private securities-fraud action under §10(b) of\n  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange\n  Commission Rule 10b–5, a plaintiff must prove, among other things,\n  reliance on a material misrepresentation or omission made by the de-\n  fendant. Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S. ___, ___.\n  Requiring proof of direct reliance “would place an unnecessarily un-\n  realistic evidentiary burden on [a] plaintiff who has traded on an im-\n  personal market.” Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 245. Thus,\n  this Court has endorsed a “fraud-on-the-market” theory, which per-\n  mits securities-fraud plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of\n  reliance on public, material misrepresentations regarding securities\n  traded in an efficient market. Id., at 241–249. The fraud-on-the-\n  market theory facilitates the certification of securities-fraud class ac-\n  tions by permitting reliance to be proved on a classwide basis.\n     Invoking the fraud-on-the-market theory, respondent Connecticut\n  Retirement Plans and Trust Funds (Connecticut Retirement) sought\n  certification of a securities-fraud class action under Federal Rule of\n  Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) against biotechnology company Amgen Inc.\n  and several of its officers (collectively, Amgen). The District Court\n  certified the class, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Ninth Circuit\n  rejected Amgen’s argument that Connecticut Retirement was re-\n  quired to prove the materiality of Amgen’s alleged misrepresenta-\n  tions and omissions before class certification in order to satisfy Rule\n  23(b)(3)’s requirement that “questions of law or fact common to class\n  members predominate over any questions affecting only individual\n  members.” The Ninth Circuit also held that the District Court did\n  not err in refusing to consider rebuttal evidence that Amgen had pre-\n2       AMGEN, INC. v.

Pp. 9–26.\n    (a) The pivotal inquiry in this case is whether proof of materiality\n is needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the\n class will “predominate over any questions affecting only individual\n members” as the litigation progresses. For two reasons, the answer\n to this question is “no.” First, because materiality is judged accord-\n ing to an objective standard, it can be proved through evidence com-\n mon to the class. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S.\n 438, 445. Thus, it is a common question for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes.\n Second, a failure of proof on the common question of materiality\n would not result in individual questions predominating. Instead, it\n would end the case, for materiality is an essential element of a secu-\n rities-fraud claim. Pp. 9–14.\n    (b) Amgen’s arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 14–\n 24.\n      (1) Amgen points to the Court’s statement in Erica P. John\n Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___, that “securities\n fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke Basic’s\n rebuttable presumption of reliance,” including “that the alleged mis-\n representations were publicly known . . . , that the stock traded in an\n efficient market, and that the relevant transaction took place ‘be-\n tween the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the\n truth was revealed.’ ” If these fraud-on-the-market predicates must\n be proved before class certification, Amgen contends, materiality—\n another fraud-on-the-market predicate—should be treated no differ-\n ently. The Court disagrees. The requirement that a putative class\n representative establish that it executed trades “between the time\n the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was re-\n vealed” relates primarily to the Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) inquiries into\n typicality and adequacy of representation, not to the Rule 23(b)(3)\n predominance inquiry. And unlike materiality, market efficiency and\n the public nature of the alleged misrepresentations are not indispen-\n sable elements of a Rule 10–5 claim. While the failure of common,\n classwide proof of market efficiency or publicity leaves open the pro-\n spect of individualized proof of reliance, the failure of common proof\n on the issue of materiality ends the case for all class members.\n Pp. 15–18.\n      (2) Amgen also contends that “policy considerations” militate in\n favor of requiring precertification proof of materiality. Because class\n certification can exert substantial pressure on the defendant to settle\n rather than risk ruinous liability, Amgen asserts, materiality may\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  never be addressed by a court if it is not required to be evaluated at\n  the class-certification stage. In this regard, however, materiality\n  does not differ from other essential elements of a Rule 10b–5 claim,\n  notably, the requirements that the statements or omissions on which\n  the plaintiff ’s claims are based were false or misleading and that the\n  alleged statements or omissions caused the plaintiff to suffer econom-\n  ic loss. Significantly, while addressing the settlement pressures as-\n  sociated with securities-fraud class actions, Congress has rejected\n  calls to undo the fraud-on-the-market theory. And contrary to\n  Amgen’s argument that requiring proof of materiality before class\n  certification would conserve judicial resources, Amgen’s position\n  would necessitate time and resource intensive mini-trials on materi-\n  ality at the class-certification stage. Pp. 18–22.\n     (c) Also unavailing is Amgen’s claim that the District Court erred\n  by refusing to consider the rebuttal evidence Amgen proffered in op-\n  posing Connecticut Retirement’s class-certification motion. The\n  Ninth Circuit concluded, and Amgen does not contest, that Amgen’s\n  rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the misrepresentations and\n  omissions alleged in Connecticut Retirement’s complaint were imma-\n  terial. The potential immateriality of Amgen’s alleged misrepresen-\n  tations and omissions, however, is no barrier to finding that common\n  questions predominate. Just as a plaintiff class’s inability to prove\n  materiality creates no risk that individual questions will predomi-\n  nate, a definitive rebuttal on the issue of materiality would not un-\n  dermine the predominance of questions common to the class.

CONNECTICUT\n   RETIREMENT PLANS AND TRUST FUNDS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 27, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case involves a securities-fraud complaint filed\nby Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds (Con­\nnecticut Retirement) against biotechnology company\nAmgen Inc. and several of its officers (collectively, Amgen).\nSeeking class-action certification under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23, Connecticut Retirement invoked the\n“fraud-on-the-market” presumption endorsed by this Court\nin Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224 (1988), and recog-\nnized most recently in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halli-\nburton Co., 563 U. S. ___ (2011). The fraud-on-the-market\npremise is that the price of a security traded in an efficient\nmarket will reflect all publicly available information about\na company; accordingly, a buyer of the security may be\npresumed to have relied on that information in purchasing\nthe security.\n   Amgen has conceded the efficiency of the market for\nthe securities at issue and has not contested the public\ncharacter of the allegedly fraudulent statements on which\nConnecticut Retirement’s complaint is based. Nor does\nAmgen here dispute that Connecticut Retirement meets\n2     AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nall of the class-action prerequisites stated in Rule 23(a):\n(1) the alleged class “is so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable”; (2) “there are questions of law\nor fact common to the class”; (3) Connecticut Retirement’s\nclaims are “typical of the claims . . . of the class”; and (4)\nConnecticut Retirement will “fairly and adequately protect\nthe interests of the class.”\n  The issue presented concerns the requirement stated in\nRule 23(b)(3) that “the questions of law or fact common to\nclass members predominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members.” Amgen contends that to meet\nthe predominance requirement, Connecticut Retirement\nmust do more than plausibly plead that Amgen’s alleged\nmisrepresentations and misleading omissions materially\naffected Amgen’s stock price. According to Amgen, certifi­\ncation must be denied unless Connecticut Retirement\nproves materiality, for immaterial misrepresentations or\nomissions, by definition, would have no impact on Amgen’s\nstock price in an efficient market.\n  While Connecticut Retirement certainly must prove\nmateriality to prevail on the merits, we hold that such\nproof is not a prerequisite to class certification. Rule\n23(b)(3) requires a showing that questions common to the\nclass predominate, not that those questions will be an­\nswered, on the merits, in favor of the class. Because mate­\nriality is judged according to an objective standard, the\nmateriality of Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations and\nomissions is a question common to all members of the\nclass Connecticut Retirement would represent. The al­\nleged misrepresentations and omissions, whether material\nor immaterial, would be so equally for all investors com­\nposing the class. As vital, the plaintiff class’s inability to\nprove materiality would not result in individual questions\npredominating. Instead, a failure of proof on the issue\nof materiality would end the case, given that materiality\nis an essential element of the class members’ securities­\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

In no\nevent will the individual circumstances of particular class\nmembers bear on the inquiry.\n   Essentially, Amgen, also the dissenters from today’s\ndecision, would have us put the cart before the horse. To\ngain certification under Rule 23(b)(3), Amgen and the\ndissenters urge, Connecticut Retirement must first estab­\nlish that it will win the fray. But the office of a Rule\n23(b)(3) certification ruling is not to adjudicate the case;\nrather, it is to select the “metho[d]” best suited to adjudi­\ncation of the controversy “fairly and efficiently.”\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   This case involves the interaction between federal\nsecurities-fraud laws and Rule 23’s requirements for\nclass certification. To obtain certification of a class ac-\ntion for money damages under Rule 23(b)(3), a plaintiff\nmust satisfy Rule 23(a)’s above-mentioned prerequisites\nof numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of\nrepresentation, see supra, at 1–2, and must also establish\nthat “the questions of law or fact common to class mem­\nbers predominate over any questions affecting only indi­\nvidual members, and that a class action is superior to\nother available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudi­\ncating the controversy.” To recover damages in a private\nsecurities-fraud action under §10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as amended, 15\nU. S. C. §78j(b) (2006 ed., Supp. V), and Securities and\nExchange Commission Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5\n(2011), a plaintiff must prove “(1) a material misrepresen­\ntation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a\nconnection between the misrepresentation or omission and\nthe purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the\nmisrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6)\n4     AMGEN INC. v.

S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   “Reliance,” we have explained, “is an essential element\nof the §10(b) private cause of action” because “proof of\nreliance ensures that there is a proper connection between\na defendant’s misrepresentation and a plaintiff ’s injury.”\nHalliburton, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “The traditional (and most\ndirect) way” for a plaintiff to demonstrate reliance “is by\nshowing that he was aware of a company’s statement and\nengaged in a relevant transaction . . . based on that specific\nmisrepresentation.” Ibid. We have recognized, however,\nthat requiring proof of direct reliance “would place an\nunnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on [a] plain­\ntiff who has traded on an impersonal market.” Basic, 485\nU. S., at 245. Accordingly, in Basic the Court endorsed the\n“fraud-on-the-market” theory, which permits certain Rule\n10b–5 plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of\nreliance on material misrepresentations aired to the gen­\neral public. Id., at 241–249.1\n   The fraud-on-the-market theory rests on the premise\nthat certain well developed markets are efficient proces­\nsors of public information. In such markets, the “market\nprice of shares” will “reflec[t] all publicly available infor­\nmation.” Id., at 246. Few investors in such markets, if\nany, can consistently achieve above-market returns by\ntrading based on publicly available information alone, for\nif such above-market returns were readily attainable, it\n——————\n   1 Part IV of Justice Blackmun’s opinion in Basic—the part endors­\n\ning the fraud-on-the-market theory—was joined by Justices Brennan,\nMarshall, and Stevens. Together, these Justices composed a majority\nof the quorum of six Justices who participated in the case. See 28\nU. S. C. §1 (“The Supreme Court of the United States shall consist of a\nChief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six\nof whom shall constitute a quorum.”).\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould mean that market prices were not efficiently incor­\nporating the full supply of public information. See R.\nBrealey, S. Myers, & F. Allen, Principles of Corporate\nFinance 330 (10th ed. 2011) (“[I]n an efficient market,\nthere is no way for most investors to achieve consistently\nsuperior rates of return.”).\n  In Basic, we held that if a market is shown to be effi­\ncient, courts may presume that investors who traded\nsecurities in that market relied on public, material mis­\nrepresentations regarding those securities. See 485 U. S.,\nat 245–247. This presumption springs from the very\nconcept of market efficiency. If a market is generally\nefficient in incorporating publicly available information\ninto a security’s market price, it is reasonable to presume\nthat a particular public, material misrepresentation will\nbe reflected in the security’s price. Furthermore, it is\nreasonable to presume that most investors—knowing that\nthey have little hope of outperforming the market in the\nlong run based solely on their analysis of publicly availa­\nble information—will rely on the security’s market price as\nan unbiased assessment of the security’s value in light of\nall public information. Thus, courts may presume that\ninvestors trading in efficient markets indirectly rely on\npublic, material misrepresentations through their “reli­\nance on the integrity of the price set by the market.” Id.,\nat 245. “[T]he presumption,” however, is “just that, and\n[can] be rebutted by appropriate evidence.” Halliburton,\n563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). See also Basic, 485 U. S.,\nat 248–249 (providing examples of showings that would\nrebut the fraud-on-the-market presumption).\n  Although fraud on the market is a substantive doctrine\nof federal securities-fraud law that can be invoked by any\nRule 10b–5 plaintiff, see, e.g., Black v. Finantra Capital,\nInc., 418 F. 3d 203, 209 (CA2 2005); Blackie v. Barrack,\n524 F. 2d 891, 908 (CA9 1975), the doctrine has particular\nsignificance in securities-fraud class actions. Absent the\n6       AMGEN INC. v.

See Basic, 485 U. S., at\n242. The fraud-on-the-market theory, however, facilitates\nclass certification by recognizing a rebuttable presumption\nof classwide reliance on public, material misrepresenta­\ntions when shares are traded in an efficient market. Ibid.2\n                             B\n   In its complaint, Connecticut Retirement alleges that\nAmgen violated §10(b) and Rule 10b–5 through certain\nmisrepresentations and misleading omissions regarding\nthe safety, efficacy, and marketing of two of its flagship\ndrugs.3 According to Connecticut Retirement, these mis­\nrepresentations and omissions artificially inflated the\nprice of Amgen’s stock at the time Connecticut Retirement\nand numerous other securities buyers purchased the\nstock. When the truth came to light, Connecticut Retire­\nment asserts, Amgen’s stock price declined, resulting in\nfinancial losses to those who purchased the stock at the\ninflated price. In its answer to Connecticut Retirement’s\ncomplaint, Amgen conceded that “[a]t all relevant times,\nthe market for [its] securities,” which are traded on the\nNASDAQ stock exchange, “was an efficient market”; thus,\n“the market for Amgen’s securities promptly digested\ncurrent information regarding Amgen from all publicly\n\n——————\n    2 Although describing Basic’s adoption of the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption of reliance as “questionable,” JUSTICE THOMAS’ dissent\nacknowledges that “the Court has not been asked to revisit” that issue.\nPost, at 4–5, n. 4.

After\ngranting Amgen’s request to take an interlocutory appeal\nfrom the District Court’s class-certification order, see Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 23(f), the Court of Appeals affirmed. See\n660 F. 3d 1170 (CA9 2011).\n   Amgen raised two arguments on appeal. First, Amgen\ncontended that the District Court erred by certifying the\nproposed class without first requiring Connecticut Retire­\nment to prove that Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations\nand omissions were material. Second, Amgen argued that\nthe District Court erred by refusing to consider certain\nrebuttal evidence that Amgen had proffered in opposition\nto Connecticut Retirement’s class-certification motion.\nThis evidence, in Amgen’s view, demonstrated that the\nmarket was well aware of the truth regarding its alleged\nmisrepresentations and omissions at the time the class\nmembers purchased their shares.\n   The Court of Appeals rejected both contentions.\nAmgen’s first argument, the Court of Appeals noted, made\nthe uncontroversial point that immaterial misrepresenta­\ntions and omissions “by definition [do] not affect . . . stock\nprice[s] in an efficient market.” Id., at 1175. Thus,\nwhere misrepresentations and omissions are not material,\nthere is no basis for presuming classwide reliance on\nthose misrepresentations and omissions through the\ninformation-processing mechanism of the market price.\n“The problem with that argument,” the Court of Appeals ob­\nserved, is evident: “[B]ecause materiality is an element of\n8    AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                    AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nthe merits of their securities fraud claim, the plaintiffs\ncannot both fail to prove materiality yet still have a viable\nclaim for which they would need to prove reliance individ­\nually.” Ibid. The Court of Appeals thus concluded that\n“proof of materiality is not necessary” to ensure compli­\nance with Rule 23(b)(3)’s requirement that common ques­\ntions predominate. Id., at 1177.\n   With respect to Amgen’s second argument, the Court of\nAppeals determined that Amgen’s proffered rebuttal\nevidence was merely “a method of refuting [the] materi-\nality” of the misrepresentations and omissions alleged\nin Connecticut Retirement’s complaint. Ibid. Having al-\nready concluded that a securities-fraud plaintiff does not\nneed to prove materiality before class certification, the\ncourt similarly held that “the district court correctly re­\nfused to consider” Amgen’s rebuttal evidence “at the class\ncertification stage.” Ibid.\n   We granted Amgen’s petition for certiorari, 567 U. S. ___\n(2012), to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals\nover whether district courts must require plaintiffs to\nprove, and must allow defendants to present evidence\nrebutting, the element of materiality before certifying a\nclass action under §10(b) and Rule 10b–5.

Dukes, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), Rule 23 grants courts no license to engage\nin free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification stage.\nMerits questions may be considered to the extent—but\nonly to the extent—that they are relevant to determining\nwhether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification\nare satisfied. See id., at ___, n. 6 (slip op., at 10, n. 6) (a\ndistrict court has no “ ‘authority to conduct a preliminary\ninquiry into the merits of a suit’ ” at class certification\nunless it is necessary “to determine the propriety of certi­\nfication” (quoting Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S.\n156, 177 (1974))); Advisory Committee’s 2003 Note on\nsubd. (c)(1) of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U. S. C. App.,\np. 144 (“[A]n evaluation of the probable outcome on the\nmerits is not properly part of the certification decision.”).\n   Bearing firmly in mind that the focus of Rule 23(b)(3)\nis on the predominance of common questions, we turn to\nAmgen’s contention that the courts below erred by failing\nto require Connecticut Retirement to prove the material­\nity of Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations and omissions\nbefore certifying Connecticut Retirement’s proposed class.\nAs Amgen notes, materiality is not only an element of the\nRule 10b–5 cause of action; it is also an essential predicate\nof the fraud-on-the-market theory. See Basic, 485 U. S., at\n247 (“[W]here materially misleading statements have been\ndisseminated into an impersonal, well-developed market\n10    AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor securities, the reliance of individual plaintiffs on the\nintegrity of the market price may be presumed.” (emphasis\nadded)). That theory, Amgen correctly observes, is prem­\nised on the understanding that in an efficient market,\nall publicly available information is rapidly incorporated\ninto, and thus transmitted to investors through, the mar­\nket price. See id., at 246–247. Because immaterial in-\nformation, by definition, does not affect market price,\nit cannot be relied upon indirectly by investors who, as\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory presumes, rely on the mar­\nket price’s integrity. Therefore, the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory cannot apply absent a material misrepresentation\nor omission. And without the fraud-on-the-market theory,\nthe element of reliance cannot be proved on a classwide\nbasis through evidence common to the class. See id., at\n242. It thus follows, Amgen contends, that materiality\nmust be proved before a securities-fraud class action can\nbe certified.\n   Contrary to Amgen’s argument, the key question in this\ncase is not whether materiality is an essential predicate of\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory; indisputably it is.4 In­\nstead, the pivotal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is\nneeded to ensure that the questions of law or fact common\nto the class will “predominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members” as the litigation progresses.\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3). For two reasons, the answer\nto this question is clearly “no.”\n\n——————\n  4 We agree with JUSTICE THOMAS that “[m]ateriality was central to\n\nthe development, analysis, and adoption of the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory both before Basic and in Basic itself.” Post, at 18. We disagree,\nhowever, that the history of the fraud-on-the-market theory’s develop­\nment “confirms that materiality must be proved at the time that the\ntheory is invoked—i.e., at certification.” Ibid. As explained below, see\ninfra this page and 11–13, proof of materiality is not required prior to\nclass certification because such proof is not necessary to ensure satis­\nfaction of Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   First, because “[t]he question of materiality . . . is an\nobjective one, involving the significance of an omitted or\nmisrepresented fact to a reasonable investor,” materiality\ncan be proved through evidence common to the class. TSC\nIndustries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 445\n(1976). Consequently, materiality is a “common ques­\ntio[n]” for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3). Basic, 485 U. S., at\n242 (listing “materiality” as one of the questions common\nto the Basic class members).\n   Second, there is no risk whatever that a failure of proof\non the common question of materiality will result in indi­\nvidual questions predominating. Because materiality is\nan essential element of a Rule 10b–5 claim, see Matrixx\nInitiatives, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), Connecticut\nRetirement’s failure to present sufficient evidence of mate­\nriality to defeat a summary-judgment motion or to prevail\nat trial would not cause individual reliance questions to\noverwhelm the questions common to the class. Instead,\nthe failure of proof on the element of materiality would\nend the case for one and for all; no claim would re­\nmain in which individual reliance issues could potentially\npredominate.\n   Totally misapprehending our essential point, JUSTICE\nTHOMAS’ dissent asserts that our “entire argument is\nbased on the assumption that the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption need not be shown at certification because it\nwill be proved later on the merits.” Post, at 11, n. 9. Our\nposition is not so based. We rest, instead, entirely on the\ntext of Rule 23(b)(3), which provides for class certification\nif “the questions of law or fact common to class members\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers.” A failure of proof on the common question of\nmateriality ends the litigation and thus will never cause\nindividual questions of reliance or anything else to over­\nwhelm questions common to the class. Therefore, under\nthe plain language of Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs are not\n12    AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired to prove materiality at the class-certification\nstage. In other words, they need not, at that threshold,\nprove that the predominating question will be answered in\ntheir favor.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS urges that a plaintiff seeking class\ncertification “must show that the elements of [her] claim\nare susceptible to classwide proof.” Post, at 7. See also\npost, at 11 (criticizing the Court for failing to focus its\nanalysis on “whether the element of reliance is susceptible\nto classwide proof ”). From this premise, JUSTICE THOMAS\nconcludes that Rule 10b–5 plaintiffs must prove material-\nity before class certification because (1) “materiality is a\nnecessary component of fraud on the market,” and (2)\nwithout fraud on the market, the Rule 10b–5 element of\nreliance is not “susceptible of a classwide answer.” Post,\nat 6, 10–11. See also post, at 12 (“[I]f a plaintiff wishes to\nuse Basic’s presumption to prove that reliance is a com­\nmon question, he must establish the entire presumption,\nincluding materiality, at the class certification stage.”).\n   Rule 23(b)(3), however, does not require a plaintiff\nseeking class certification to prove that each “elemen[t] of\n[her] claim [is] susceptible to classwide proof.” Post, at 7.\nWhat the rule does require is that common questions\n“predominate over any questions affecting only individual\n[class] members.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3) (emphasis\nadded). Nowhere does JUSTICE THOMAS explain how, in\nan action invoking the Basic presumption, a plaintiff\nclass’s failure to prove an essential element of its claim for\nrelief will result in individual questions predominating\nover common ones. Absent proof of materiality, the claim\nof the Rule 10b–5 class will fail in its entirety; there will\nbe no remaining individual questions to adjudicate.\n   Consequently, proof of materiality is not required to\nestablish that a proposed class is “sufficiently cohesive\nto warrant adjudication by representation”—the focus of\nthe predominance inquiry under Rule 23(b)(3). Amchem\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nProducts, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 623 (1997). No\ndoubt a clever mind could conjure up fantastic scenarios in\nwhich an individual investor might rely on immaterial\ninformation (think of the superstitious investor who sells\nher securities based on a CEO’s statement that a black cat\ncrossed the CEO’s path that morning). But such objectively\nunreasonable reliance does not give rise to a Rule 10b–5\nclaim. See TSC Industries, 426 U. S., at 445 (materiality\nis judged by an objective standard). Thus, “the individual­\nized questions of reliance,” post, at 9, n. 8, that hypotheti­\ncally might arise when a failure of proof on the issue of\nmateriality dooms the fraud-on-the-market class are far\nmore imaginative than real. Such “individualized ques­\ntions” do not undermine class cohesion and thus cannot be\nsaid to “predominate” for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3).5\n   Because the question of materiality is common to the\nclass, and because a failure of proof on that issue would\nnot result in questions “affecting only individual members”\npredominating, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3), Connecticut\nRetirement was not required to prove the materiality of\nAmgen’s alleged misrepresentations and omissions at the\nclass-certification stage. This is not a case in which the\nasserted problem—i.e., that the plaintiff class cannot\nprove materiality—“exhibits some fatal dissimilarity”\namong class members that would make use of the class­\naction device inefficient or unfair. Nagareda, Class Certi­\nfication in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev.\n97, 107 (2009). Instead, what Amgen alleges is “a fatal\nsimilarity—[an alleged] failure of proof as to an element of\n——————\n  5 JUSTICE THOMAS is also wrong in arguing that a failure of proof on\n\nthe issue of materiality would demonstrate that a Rule 10b–5 class\naction “should not have been certified in the first place.” Post, at 2.\nQuite the contrary. The fact that such a failure of proof resolves all\nclass members’ claims once and for all, leaving no individual issues to\nbe adjudicated, confirms that the original certification decision was\nproper.\n14     AMGEN INC. v.

Such a contention is\nproperly addressed at trial or in a ruling on a summary­\njudgment motion. The allegation should not be resolved in\ndeciding whether to certify a proposed class. Ibid. See\nalso Schleicher, 618 F. 3d, at 687 (“[W]hether a statement\nis materially false is a question common to all class mem­\nbers and therefore may be resolved on a class-wide basis\nafter certification.”).\n                             B\n  Insisting that materiality must be proved at the class­\ncertification stage, Amgen relies chiefly on two arguments,\nneither of which we find persuasive.6\n——————\n  6 Amgen advances a third argument founded on modern economic\n\nresearch tending to show that market efficiency is not “ ‘a binary, yes or\nno question.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 32 (quoting Langevoort, Basic at\nTwenty: Rethinking Fraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 167).\nInstead, this research suggests, differences in efficiency can exist\nwithin a single market. For example, a market may more readily\nprocess certain forms of widely disseminated and easily digestible\ninformation, such as public merger announcements, than information\nmore difficult to acquire and understand, such as obscure technical\ndata buried in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSee, e.g., Macey & Miller, Good Finance, Bad Economics: An Analysis of\nthe Fraud-on-the-Market Theory, 42 Stan. L. Rev. 1059, 1083–1087\n(1990); Stout, The Mechanisms of Market Inefficiency: An Introduction\nto the New Finance, 28 J. Corp. L. 635, 653–656 (2003). Amgen,\nhowever, never clearly explains how this research on market efficiency\nbolsters its argument that courts should require precertification proof\nof materiality. In any event, this case is a poor vehicle for exploring\nwhatever implications the research Amgen cites may have for the\nfraud-on-the-market presumption recognized in Basic. As noted above,\nsee supra, at 6–7, Amgen conceded in its answer that the market for its\nsecurities is “efficient” and thus “promptly digest[s] current information\nregarding Amgen from all publicly available sources and reflect[s] such\ninformation in Amgen’s stock price.” Consolidated Amended Class\nAction Complaint ¶¶199–200; Answer ¶¶199–200.

S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 5–6) (quoting Basic, 485 U. S., at 248, n. 27). See\nalso Dukes, 564 U. S., at ___, n. 6 (slip op., at 11, n. 6)\n(“[P]laintiffs seeking 23(b)(3) certification [of a securities­\nfraud class action] must prove that their shares were\ntraded on an efficient market.”). If these fraud-on-the-market\npredicates must be proved before class certification,\nAmgen contends, materiality—another fraud-on-the­\nmarket predicate—should be treated no differently.\n   We disagree. As an initial matter, the requirement that\na putative class representative establish that it executed\ntrades “between the time the misrepresentations were\nmade and the time the truth was revealed” relates primar­\nily to the Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) inquiries into typicality\nand adequacy of representation, not to the Rule 23(b)(3)\npredominance inquiry. Basic, 485 U. S., at 248, n. 27.7 A\n——————\nefficient). Amgen remains bound by that concession. See American\nTitle Ins. Co. v. Lacelaw Corp., 861 F. 2d 224, 226 (CA9 1988) (“Factual\nassertions in pleadings and pretrial orders, unless amended, are\nconsidered judicial admissions conclusively binding on the party who\nmade them.”); cf. Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal., Has-\ntings College of Law v. Martinez, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at\n10) (“This Court has . . . refused to consider a party’s argument that\ncontradicted a joint ‘stipulation [entered] at the outset of th[e] litiga­\ntion.’ ” (quoting Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth,\n529 U. S. 217, 226 (2000))). We thus find nothing in the cited research\nthat would support requiring precertification proof of materiality in this\ncase.\n   7 As earlier noted, see supra, at 1–2, Amgen does not here contest\n16     AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                      AND TRUST FUNDS\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsecurity’s market price cannot be affected by a misrepre­\nsentation not yet made, and in an efficient market, a\nmisrepresentation’s impact on market price is quickly\nnullified once the truth comes to light. Thus, a plaintiff\nwhose relevant transactions were not executed between\nthe time the misrepresentation was made and the time the\ntruth was revealed cannot be said to have indirectly relied\non the misrepresentation through its reliance on the in­\ntegrity of the market price.8 Such a plaintiff ’s claims,\ntherefore, would not be “typical” of the claims of investors\nwho did trade during the window between misrepresenta­\ntion and truth revelation. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(a)(3).\nNor could a court confidently conclude that such a plaintiff\nwould “fairly and adequately protect the interests” of\ninvestors who traded during the relevant window. Rule\n23(a)(4). The requirement that the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory’s trade-timing predicate be established before\nclass certification thus sheds little light on the question\nwhether materiality must also be proved at the class­\ncertification stage.\n   Amgen is not aided by Halliburton’s statement that\nmarket efficiency and the public nature of the alleged\nmisrepresentations must be proved before a securities­\nfraud class action can be certified. As Amgen notes, mar­\nket efficiency, publicity, and materiality can all be proved\non a classwide basis. Furthermore, they are all essential\npredicates of the fraud-on-the-market theory. Unless\n——————\nConnecticut Retirement’s satisfaction of Rule 23(a)’s requirements.\n  8 Accordingly, “the timing of the relevant stock trades” is indeed an\n\n“element” of the fraud-on-the-market theory. Post, at 6, n. 6 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.). Unlike JUSTICE THOMAS, however, see ibid., we do not\nunderstand the United States as amicus curiae to take a different view.\nSee Brief for United States 15, n. 2 (“Precise identification of the times\nwhen the alleged misrepresentation was made and the truth was\nsubsequently revealed is . . . important to ensure that the named\nplaintiff has traded stock during the time the stock price allegedly was\ndistorted by the defendant’s misrepresentations.”).\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthose predicates are established, there is no basis for\npresuming that the defendant’s alleged misrepresenta­\ntions were reflected in the security’s market price, and\nhence no grounding for any contention that investors\nindirectly relied on those misrepresentations through their\nreliance on the integrity of the market price. But unlike\nmateriality, market efficiency and publicity are not indis­\npensable elements of a Rule 10b–5 claim. See Matrixx\nInitiatives, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (listing ele­\nments of a Rule 10b–5 claim). Thus, where the market for\na security is inefficient or the defendant’s alleged misrep­\nresentations were not aired publicly, a plaintiff cannot\ninvoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption. She can,\nhowever, attempt to establish reliance through the “tradi­\ntional” mode of demonstrating that she was personally\n“aware of [the defendant’s] statement and engaged in a\nrelevant transaction . . . based on that specific misrepre­\nsentation.” Halliburton, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\nIndividualized reliance issues would predominate in such\na lawsuit. See Basic, 485 U. S., at 242. The litigation,\ntherefore, could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) as a\nclass action, but the initiating plaintiff ’s claim would\nremain live; it would not be “dead on arrival.” 660 F. 3d,\nat 1175.\n   A failure of proof on the issue of materiality, in contrast,\nnot only precludes a plaintiff from invoking the fraud-on­\nthe-market presumption of classwide reliance; it also\nestablishes as a matter of law that the plaintiff cannot\nprevail on the merits of her Rule 10b–5 claim. Materiality\nthus differs from the market-efficiency and publicity pred­\nicates in this critical respect: While the failure of common,\nclasswide proof on the issues of market efficiency and\npublicity leaves open the prospect of individualized proof\nof reliance, the failure of common proof on the issue of\nmateriality ends the case for the class and for all indi­\nviduals alleged to compose the class. See Brief for United\n18   AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                    AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nStates as Amicus Curiae 20 (“Unless the failure of com-\nmon proof gives rise to a need for individualized proof, it\ndoes not cast doubt on the propriety of class certifica­\ntion.”). In short, there can be no actionable reliance,\nindividually or collectively, on immaterial information. Be-\ncause a failure of proof on the issue of materiality, unlike\nthe issues of market efficiency and publicity, does not give\nrise to any prospect of individual questions overwhelming\ncommon ones, materiality need not be proved prior to Rule\n23(b)(3) class certification.\n                              2\n   Amgen also contends that certain “policy considerations”\nmilitate in favor of requiring precertification proof of\nmateriality. Brief for Petitioners 28. An order granting\nclass certification, Amgen observes, can exert substantial\npressure on a defendant “to settle rather than incur the\ncosts of defending a class action and run the risk of poten­\ntially ruinous liability.” Advisory Committee’s 1998 Note\non subd. (f) of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U. S. C. App.,\np. 143. See also AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion,\n563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16) (class actions\ncan entail a “risk of ‘in terrorem’ settlements”). Absent\na requirement to evaluate materiality at the class­\ncertification stage, Amgen contends, the issue may never\nbe addressed by a court, for the defendant will surrender\nand settle soon after a class is certified. Insistence on\nproof of materiality before certifying a securities-fraud\nclass action, Amgen thus urges, ensures that the issue\nwill be adjudicated and not forgone. See also post, at 4\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (expressing the same concerns).\n   In this regard, however, materiality does not differ from\nother essential elements of a Rule 10b–5 claim, notably,\nthe requirements that the statements or omissions on\nwhich the plaintiff ’s claims are based were false or mis­\nleading and that the alleged statements or omissions\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Settlement\npressure exerted by class certification may prevent judi­\ncial resolution of these issues. Yet this Court has held\nthat loss causation and the falsity or misleading nature of\nthe defendant’s alleged statements or omissions are com­\nmon questions that need not be adjudicated before a class\nis certified. See Halliburton, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n3) (loss causation need not be proved at the class­\ncertification stage); Basic, 485 U. S., at 242 (“the falsity or\nmisleading nature of the . . . public statements” allegedly\nmade by the defendant is a “common questio[n]”). See also\nSchleicher, 618 F. 3d, at 685 (falsity of alleged mis-\nstatements need not be proved before certification of a\nsecurities-fraud class action).\n   Congress, we count it significant, has addressed the\nsettlement pressures associated with securities-fraud class\nactions through means other than requiring proof of mate­\nriality at the class-certification stage. In enacting the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA),\n109 Stat. 737, Congress recognized that although private\nsecurities-fraud litigation furthers important public-policy\ninterests, prime among them, deterring wrongdoing and\nproviding restitution to defrauded investors, such law-\nsuits have also been subject to abuse, including the\n“extract[ion]” of “extortionate ‘settlements’ ” of frivolous\nclaims. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104–369, pp. 31–32 (1995).\nThe PSLRA’s response to the perceived abuses was, inter\nalia, to “impos[e] heightened pleading requirements” for\nsecurities-fraud actions, “limit recoverable damages and\nattorney’s fees, provide a ‘safe harbor’ for forward-looking\nstatements, impose new restrictions on the selection of\n(and compensation awarded to) lead plaintiffs, mandate\nimposition of sanctions for frivolous litigation, and author­\nize a stay of discovery pending resolution of any motion to\ndismiss.” Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v.\n20   AMGEN INC. v.

Congress later fortified\nthe PSLRA by enacting the Securities Litigation Uniform\nStandards Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 3227, which curtailed\nplaintiffs’ ability to evade the PSLRA’s limitations on\nfederal securities-fraud litigation by bringing class-action\nsuits under state rather than federal law. See 15 U. S. C.\n§78bb(f)(1) (2006 ed.).\n   While taking these steps to curb abusive securities­\nfraud lawsuits, Congress rejected calls to undo the fraud­\non-the-market presumption of classwide reliance endorsed\nin Basic. See Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking\nFraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 153, and n. 8\n(noting that the initial version of H. R. 10, 104th Cong.,\n1st Sess.

R. 10’s\nrequirement that securities-fraud plaintiffs prove direct\nreliance). Nor did Congress decree that securities-fraud\nplaintiffs prove each element of their claim before obtain­\ning class certification. Because Congress has homed in on\nthe precise policy concerns raised in Amgen’s brief, “[w]e\ndo not think it appropriate for the judiciary to make its\nown further adjustments by reinterpreting Rule 23 to\nmake likely success on the merits essential to class certifi­\ncation in securities-fraud suits.” Schleicher, 618 F. 3d, at\n686; cf. Smith v. Bayer Corp., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 17–18) (“Congress’s decision to address the\nrelitigation concerns associated with class actions through\nthe mechanism of removal provides yet another reason for\nfederal courts to adhere in this context to longstanding\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Amgen’s argument, if embraced, would\nnecessitate a mini-trial on the issue of materiality at the\nclass-certification stage. Such preliminary adjudications\nwould entail considerable expenditures of judicial time\nand resources, costs scarcely anticipated by Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(A), which instructs that the\ndecision whether to certify a class action be made “[a]t an\nearly practicable time.” If the class is certified, materiality\nmight have to be shown all over again at trial. And if\ncertification is denied for failure to prove materiality,\nnonnamed class members would not be bound by that\ndetermination. See Smith, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12–18). They would be free to renew the fray, perhaps\nin another forum, perhaps with a stronger showing of\nmateriality.\n   Given the tenuousness of Amgen’s judicial-economy\nargument, Amgen’s policy arguments ultimately return to\nthe contention that private securities-fraud actions should\nbe hemmed in to mitigate their potentially “vexatiou[s]”\ncharacter. Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421\nU. S. 723, 739 (1975). We have already noted what Con­\ngress has done to control exorbitant securities-fraud ac­\ntions. See supra, at 19–20.

See post, at 1. Nevertheless, he maintains\nthat full satisfaction of Rule 23’s requirements is insuffi­\ncient to obtain class certification under Basic. In JUSTICE\nSCALIA’s view, the Court’s decision in Basic established a\nspecial rule: A securities-fraud class action cannot be\ncertified unless all of the prerequisites of the fraud-on-the­\nmarket presumption of reliance, including materiality,\nhave first been established.

It\ncannot be attributed to anything the Court said in Basic.\nThat decision is best known for its endorsement of the\nfraud-on-the-market theory. But the opinion also estab­\nlished something more. It stated the proper standard for\njudging the materiality of misleading statements regard­\ning the existence and status of preliminary merger discus­\nsions. See 485 U.

The District Court in Basic\ncertified a class of investors whose share prices were\nallegedly depressed by misleading statements that dis­\nguised ongoing merger negotiations. Id., at 228. Postcer­\ntification, the court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants on the ground that the alleged misstatements\nwere immaterial as a matter of law. Id., at 228–229. The\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the class certification but re­\nversed the grant of summary judgment. Id., at 229. This\nCourt, in turn, vacated the Court of Appeals’ judgment\nand remanded for further proceedings on the defendants’\nsummary-judgment motion in light of the materiality\nstandard set forth in the Court’s opinion. Id., at 240–241,\n250. Notably, however, we did not disturb the District\nCourt’s class-certification order, which we stated “was\nappropriate when made.” Id., at 250.9\n   If JUSTICE SCALIA were correct that our decision in\nBasic demands proof of materiality before class certifica­\ntion, the Court in Basic should have ordered the lower\ncourts to reconsider on remand both the defendants’ enti­\ntlement to summary judgment and the propriety of class\ncertification. Instead, the Court expressly endorsed the\nDistrict Court’s class-certification order while at the same\ntime recognizing that further proceedings were necessary\nto determine whether the plaintiffs had mustered suffi­\ncient evidence to satisfy the relatively lenient standard for\n——————\n  9 Scouring the Court’s decision in Basic for some semblance of support\n\nfor his position, JUSTICE SCALIA attaches portentous significance to\nBasic’s statement that the District Court’s class-certification order,\nalthough “ ‘appropriate when made,’ ” was “ ‘subject on remand to such\nadjustment, if any, as developing circumstances demand[ed].’ ” Post, at\n2 (quoting Basic, 485 U.

This evidence, Amgen contends, showed that “in\nlight of all the information available to the market,” its\nalleged misrepresentations and misleading omissions\n“could not be presumed to have altered the market price\nbecause they would not have ‘significantly altered the\ntotal mix of information made available.’ ” Brief for Peti­\ntioners 40–41 (quoting Basic, 485 U.

For ex­\nample, Connecticut Retirement’s complaint alleges that an\nAmgen executive misleadingly downplayed the signifi­\ncance of an upcoming Food and Drug Administration\nadvisory committee meeting by incorrectly stating that the\nmeeting would not focus on one of Amgen’s leading drugs.\nSee App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a.

See id., at 41a–42a.\nSee also 69 Fed. Reg. 16582 (2004).\n   The District Court did not err, we agree with the Court\nof Appeals, by disregarding Amgen’s rebuttal evidence in\ndeciding whether Connecticut Retirement’s proposed class\nsatisfied Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement. The\nCourt of Appeals concluded, and Amgen does not contest,\nthat Amgen’s rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the\nmisrepresentations and omissions alleged in Connecticut\nRetirement’s complaint were immaterial.           660 F. 3d,\nat 1177 (characterizing Amgen’s rebuttal evidence as\nan attempt to present a “ ‘truth-on-the-market’ defense,”\nwhich the Court of Appeals explained “is a method of\nrefuting an alleged misrepresentation’s materiality”). See\nalso Reply Brief 17 (Amgen’s evidence was offered to rebut\nthe “materiality predicate” of the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory). As explained above, however, the potential im­\nmateriality of Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations and\nomissions is no barrier to finding that common questions\npredominate. See Part II, supra. If the alleged misrepre­\nsentations and omissions are ultimately found immaterial,\nthe fraud-on-the-market presumption of classwide reliance\nwill collapse. But again, as earlier explained, see supra, at\n10–13, individual reliance questions will not overwhelm\nquestions common to the class, for the class members’\nclaims will have failed on their merits, thus bringing the\nlitigation to a close. Therefore, just as a plaintiff class’s\ninability to prove materiality creates no risk that individ­\nual questions will predominate, so even a definitive rebut­\ntal on the issue of materiality would not undermine the\npredominance of questions common to the class.\n   We recognized as much in Basic itself. A defendant\ncould “rebut the [fraud-on-the-market] presumption of\nreliance,” we observed in Basic, by demonstrating that\n“news of the [truth] credibly entered the market and dissi­\n26     AMGEN INC. v.

This rule is to be found nowhere in the United\nStates Code or in the common law of fraud or deception; it\nwas invented by the Court in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485\nU. S. 224 (1988). Today’s Court applies to that rule the\nprinciples of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), and\nthereby concludes (logically enough) that commonality is\nestablished at the certification stage even when material-\nity has not been shown. That would be a correct procedure\nif Basic meant the rule it announced to govern only the\nquestion of substantive liability—what must be shown in\norder to prevail. If that were so, the new substantive rule,\nlike the more general substantive rule that reliance must\nbe proved, would be subject, at the certification stage, to\nthe commonality analysis of Rule 23(b)(3). In my view,\nhowever, the Basic rule of fraud-on-the-market—a well\nfunctioning market plus purchase or sale in the market\nplus material misrepresentation known to the market\nestablishes a necessary showing of reliance—governs not\nonly the question of substantive liability, but also the\n2    AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nquestion whether certification is proper. All of the ele-\nments of that rule, including materiality, must be estab-\nlished if and when it is relied upon to justify certification.\nThe answer to the question before us today is to be found\nnot in Rule 23(b)(3), but in the opinion of Basic.\n   Basic established a presumption that the misrepresen-\ntation was relied upon, not a mere presumption that the\nplaintiffs relied on the market price. And it established\nthat presumption not just for the question of substantive\nliability but also for the question of certification. “We\ngranted certiorari . . . to determine whether the courts\nbelow properly applied a presumption of reliance in certify-\ning the class, rather than requiring each class member to\nshow direct reliance on Basic’s statements.” 485 U. S., at\n230 (emphasis added). Of course it makes no sense to\n“presume reliance” on the misrepresentation merely be-\ncause the plaintiff relied on the market price, unless the\nalleged misrepresentation would likely have affected the\nmarket price—that is, unless it was material. Thus, as\nJUSTICE THOMAS’ dissent shows, the Basic opinion is shot\nthrough with references to the necessary materiality. The\npresumption of reliance does not apply, and hence neither\nsubstantive liability will attach nor will certification be\nproper, unless materiality is shown. The necessity of\nmateriality for certification is demonstrated by the last\nsentence of the Basic opinion, which comes after the Court\nhas decided to remand the case for reconsideration of\nmateriality under the appropriate legal standard: “The\nDistrict Court’s certification of the class here was appro-\npriate when made but is subject on remand to such ad-\njustment, if any, as developing circumstances demand.”\nId., at 250. Those circumstances are the establishment of\nfacts that rebut the presumption, including of facts that\nshow the misrepresentation was not material, or was not\nknown to the market.\n   The Court argues that if materiality were a predicate to\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

The Court manufactures an\ninconsistency on the basis of doctrine that did not govern\nclass certification at the time of Basic. We recently clari-\nfied that “Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading\nstandard.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 10). But review of the Basic certifi-\ncation order shows that the District Court’s fraud-on-the-\nmarket analysis was based exclusively on the pleadings:\n“[T]he allegations of plaintiffs’ complaint are sufficient to\nbring this section 10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5) claim within the\nso-called ‘fraud on the market’ theory.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, O. T. 1987, No. 86–279,\np. 115a (emphasis added); see also ibid. (citing complaint\nparagraphs as establishing fraud on the market). Under a\npleadings standard, the District Court found that the\nplaintiffs had satisfied Rule 23(b)(3) with regard to fraud\non the market, including its materiality predicate. See id.,\nat 133a (denial of reconsideration) (“This court ruled on\nDecember 10 that transaction causation [i.e., reliance]\ncould be established by the following: proof of a material\nmisrepresentation which affected the market price of the\nstocks with a resulting injury to the plaintiffs” (emphasis\nadded)). Thus, even if the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded\nmateriality that the certification order “was appropriate\nwhen made,” Basic, supra, at 250, the defendants retained\nan opportunity on remand to rebut the pleading in order to\ndefeat certification.*\n——————\n  * As for the Court’s contention that I have “[s]cour[ed] the Court’s\ndecision in Basic” to find “some semblance of support” for my reading of\nthe case, ante, at 23, n. 9: It does not take much scouring to come across\n4     AMGEN, INC. v.

It does an injustice to the Basic Court to presume\nwithout clear evidence—and indeed in the face of language\nto the contrary—that it was establishing a regime in\nwhich not only those market class-action suits that have\nearned the presumption of reliance pass beyond the cru-\ncial certification stage, but all market-purchase and\nmarket-sale class-action suits do so, no matter what the al-\nleged misrepresentation. The opinion need not be read\nthis way, and it should not.\n  The fraud-on-the-market theory approved by Basic en-\nvisions a demonstration of materiality not just for sub-\nstantive recovery but for certification. Today’s holding\ndoes not merely accept what some consider the regrettable\nconsequences of the four-Justice opinion in Basic; it ex-\npands those consequences from the arguably regrettable to\nthe unquestionably disastrous.\n\n\n\n\n—————— \n\nthe Court’s opening statement that “[w]e granted certiorari . . . to\n\ndetermine whether the courts below properly applied a presumption of \n\nreliance in certifying the class.” 485 U.

The Court does so by all but eliminating\nmateriality as one of the predicates of the fraud-on-the-\nmarket theory, which serves as an alternative mode of es-\ntablishing reliance. See Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S.\n224, 241–250 (1988). Without demonstrating materiality\nat certification, plaintiffs cannot establish Basic’s fraud-\non-the-market presumption. Without proof of fraud on the\nmarket, plaintiffs cannot show that otherwise individual-\nized questions of reliance will predominate, as required\nby Rule 23(b)(3). And without satisfying Rule 23(b)(3),\nclass certification is improper. Fraud on the market is\nthus a condition precedent to class certification, without\nwhich individualized questions of reliance will defeat\ncertification.\n   The Court’s opinion depends on the following assump-\ntion: Plaintiffs will either (1) establish materiality at the\nmerits stage, in which case class certification was proper\n2       AMGEN, INC. v.

The\nfailure to establish materiality retrospectively confirms\nthat fraud on the market was never established, that\nquestions regarding the element of reliance were not\ncommon under Rule 23(b)(3), and, by extension, that\ncertification was never proper. Plaintiffs cannot be ex-\ncused of their Rule 23 burden to show at certification that\nquestions of reliance are common merely because they\nmight lose later on the merits element of materiality.\nBecause a securities-fraud plaintiff invoking Basic’s fraud-\non-the-market presumption to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3) should\nbe required to prove each of the predicates of that theory\nat certification in order to demonstrate that questions of\nreliance are common to the class, I respectfully dissent.\n                             A\n  We begin with §10 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, 15 U.

Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 343–344 (2005)\n(discussing common-law roots of securities-fraud actions),\nthis requirement was easily met by showing that the seller\nmade statements directly to the purchaser and that the\npurchaser bought stock in reliance on those statements.\nHowever, in a modern securities market many, if not most,\nindividuals who purchase stock from third parties on an\nimpersonal exchange will be unaware of statements made\nby the issuer of those securities. As a result, such pur-\nchaser-plaintiffs are unable to meet the traditional reli-\nance requirement because they cannot establish that they\n“engaged in a relevant transaction . . . based on [a] specific\nmisrepresentation.” Erica P.

Justice White’s concerns remain valid\ntoday, but the Court has not been asked to revisit Basic’s fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption. I thus limit my dissent to demonstrating that the\nCourt is not following Basic’s dictates.\n   Moreover, the Court acknowledges there is disagreement as to\nwhether market efficiency is “ ‘ “a binary, yes or no question,” ’ ” or in-\nstead operates differently depending on the information at issue, see\nante, at 14, n. 6 (quoting Brief for Petitioners 32, in turn quoting\nLangevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking Fraud on the Market, 2009\nWis.

See, e.g., ante, at 9 (materiality is “indisputably”\n“an essential predicate of the fraud-on-the-market the-\nory”); Brief for Respondent 29 (“If the statement is not\nmaterially false, then no one in the class can establish\nreliance via the integrity of the market”). The materiality\nof a specific statement is, therefore, essential to the fraud-\non-the-market presumption, which in turn enables a\nplaintiff to prove reliance.\n                             B\n    Basic’s fraud-on-the-market presumption is highly sig-\n——————\n   6 The United States as amicus curiae invokes Rule 23(a)(3) to suggest\n\nthat the third element, the timing of the relevant stock trades, is a\n“limit on the definition of the class.” Brief for United States 15, n. 2.\nBut it is also necessary to establish the timing of the allegedly material,\npublic misstatement made into an allegedly efficient market (as well as\nwhen the fraud ended due to entry of truth on the market) before the\nfraud-on-the-market theory can be evaluated under Rule 23(b)(3).\nThus, the lower court opinion in Basic expressly identified “the time the\nmisrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed” as\npart of fraud on the market. Levinson v. Basic Inc., 786 F. 2d 741, 750\n(CA6 1986). The Basic Court cited the formulation approvingly, 485\nU. S., at 248, n. 27, and recently in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halli-\nburton Co., 563 U. S. ___ (2011), the Court cited the same language as\npart of the “undisputed” elements a securities-fraud plaintiff must\nprove to invoke Basic. 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5–6) (quoting Basic,\nsupra, at 248, n. 27). Unless the timing of the misrepresentation and\ntruth is established at certification, there is no framework within which\nto determine whether fraud on the market renders reliance a common\nquestion. Thus, insofar as the majority recognizes that timing is a\nfactor of the fraud-on-the-market theory, ante, at 16, n. 8, I agree. It\nwould be incorrect to suggest that timing solely relates to Rules 23(a)(3)\nand (4). It is equally important to establish the timing range at certifi-\ncation for Rule 23(b)(3) reliance purposes. This fact undercuts the\nmajority’s attempt to isolate materiality as the only factor of fraud on\nthe market that need not be shown at certification to demonstrate that\nreliance is a common question.\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

See, e.g., Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___, n. 6 (2011)\n(slip op., at 11, n. 6) (“[P]laintiffs seeking 23(b)(3) certifi-\ncation must prove that their shares were traded on an ef-\nficient market,” an element of the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory (emphasis added)). Without that proof, there is\nno justification for certifying a class because there is no\n“ ‘capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common\nanswers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.’ ” Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9–10) (quoting Nagareda, Class Certifi-\ncation in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.

Individuals make stock transactions\nfor divergent, even idiosyncratic, reasons. As the leading\npre-Basic fraud-on-the-market case recognized, “[a] pur-\nchaser on the stock exchanges may be either unaware of a\nspecific false representation, or may not directly rely on it;\nhe may purchase because of a favorable price trend, price\n——————\n 7 There is no dispute that respondent meets the prerequisites of Fed.\n\nRule Civ.

Barrack,\n524 F. 2d 891, 907 (CA9 1975). The inquiry’s inherently\nindividualized nature renders it impossible to generate the\ncommon answers necessary for certification under Rule\n23(b)(3). See Basic, 485 U. S., at 242 (“Requiring proof of\nindividualized reliance from each member of the proposed\nplaintiff class effectively would have prevented respond-\nents from proceeding with a class action, since individual\nissues then would have overwhelmed the common ones”).\n   The Court’s solution in Basic was to allow putative class\nmembers to prove reliance through the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption. Id., at 241–250. As the Court today\nrecognizes, failure to establish fraud on the market “leaves\nopen the prospect of individualized proof of reliance.”\nAnte, at 17. Notably, the Court and the Ninth Circuit both\nacknowledge that in order to obtain the benefit of the\npresumption, plaintiffs must establish two of the fraud-on-\nthe-market predicates at class certification: (1) that the\nmarket was generally efficient, and (2) that the alleged\nmisstatement was public. See ante, at 16 (acknowledging\n“that market efficiency and the public nature of the alleged\nmisrepresentations must be proved before a securities-\nfraud class action can be certified”); 660 F. 3d 1170, 1175\n(CA9 2011) (same). See also Erica P. John Fund, 563\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (“It is undisputed that\nsecurities fraud plaintiffs must prove,” at certification\ninter alia, “that the alleged misrepresentations were pub-\nlicly known . . . [and] that the stock traded in an efficient\nmarket”). The Court is correct insofar as its statements\nrecognize that fraud on the market is a condition prece-\ndent to showing that there are common questions of reli-\nance at the time of class certification.\n   Nevertheless, the Court asserts that materiality—by its\nown admission an essential predicate to invoking fraud\non the market—need not be established at certification\nbecause it will ultimately be proved at the merits stage.\n                      Cite as: 568 U.

This assertion is an express admission\nthat parties will not know at certification whether reliance\nis an individual or common question.\n   To support its position, the Court transforms the predi-\ncate certification inquiry into a novel either-or inquiry\noccurring much later on the merits. According to the\nCourt, either (1) plaintiffs will prove materiality on the\nmerits, thus demonstrating ex post that common questions\npredominated at certification, or (2) they will fail to prove\nmateriality, at which point we learn ex post that certifica-\ntion was inappropriate because reliance was not, in fact, a\ncommon question. In the Court’s second scenario, fraud\non the market was never established, reliance for each\nclass member was inherently individualized, and Rule\n23(b)(3) in fact should have barred certification long ago.8\nThe Court suggests that the problem created by the second\nscenario is excusable because the plaintiffs will lose any-\nway on alternative merits grounds, and the case will be\n\n——————\n   8 The majority ignores this explanation of the fundamental flaw in\n\nits position, asserting that I never “explain how . . . a plaintiff class’s\nfailure to prove an essential element of its claim for relief will result in\nindividual questions predominating over common ones.” Ante, at 12.\nBut a plaintiff, who is excused from his burden of showing, at certifi-\ncation that reliance is a common question, fails to demonstrate that\ncommon questions predominate over the individualized questions of re-\nliance that are inherent in a securities fraud claim. A plaintiff must\ncarry this burden at certification for certification to be proper. The\nmajority does not respond to the inherent timing problem in its posi-\ntion. It does not explain how ignoring questions of reliance—that\nundeniably will be individualized in some cases—at certification is\njustified by the fact that those questions will be resolved months or\nyears later on the merits in a way that indicates reliance was indeed an\nindividualized question all along. Far from obeying the dictates of Rule\n23(b)(3) as it claims, ante, at 12–13, the majority unjustifiably puts off a\ncritical part of the Rule 23(b)(3) inquiry until the merits. The only way\nthe majority can purport to follow Rule 23(b)(3) is by ignoring the fact\nthat, under its own analysis, reliance may be an individualized ques-\ntion that predominates over common questions at certification.\n10   AMGEN, INC. v.

See ante, at 17 (“[F]ailure of proof on the issue of\nmateriality [at the merits stage] . . . not only precludes a\nplaintiff from invoking the fraud-on-the-market presump-\ntion of classwide reliance; it also establishes as a matter of\nlaw that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the merits of her\nRule 10b–5 claim”). But nothing in logic or precedent\njustifies ignoring at certification whether reliance is sus-\nceptible to Rule 23(b)(3) classwide proof simply because\none predicate of reliance—materiality—will be resolved, if\nat all, much later in the litigation on an independent\nmerits element.\n   It is the Court, not Amgen, that “would have us put the\ncart before the horse,” ante, at 3, by jumping chronologi-\ncally to the §10(b) merits element of materiality. But Rule\n23, as well as common sense, requires class certification\nissues to be addressed first. See Rule 23(c)(1)(A) (“At an\nearly practicable time after a person sues or is sued . . .\nthe court must determine by order whether to certify the\naction as a class action”). A plaintiff who cannot prove\nmateriality does not simply have a claim that is “ ‘dead on\narrival’ ” at the merits, ante, at 17 (quoting 660 F. 3d, at\n1175); he has a class that should never have arrived at the\nmerits at all because it failed Rule 23(b)(3) certification\nfrom the outset. Without materiality, there is no fraud-\non-the-market presumption, questions of reliance remain\nindividualized, and Rule 23(b)(3) certification is impossi-\nble. And the fact that evidence of materiality goes to both\nfraud on the market at certification and an independent\nmerits element is no issue; Wal-Mart expressly held that a\ncourt at certification may inquire into questions that also\nhave later relevance on the merits. See 564 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 10–11). The Court reverses that inquiry,\neffectively saying that certification may be put off until\nlater because an adverse merits determination will retro-\nactively wipe out the entire class. However, a plaintiff\nwho cannot prove materiality cannot prove fraud on the\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Ante, at 10 (“[T]he piv-\notal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is needed to\nensure that the questions of law or fact common to the\nclass will ‘predominate’ ”). The result is that the Court\neffectively equates §10(b) materiality with fraud-on-the-\nmarket materiality and elides reliance as a §10(b) ele-\nment. But a plaintiff seeking certification under Rule 23\nbears the burden of proof with regard to all the elements\nof a §10(b) claim, which includes materiality and reliance.\nAs Wal-Mart explained, “[a] party seeking class certifica-\ntion must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with\n——————\n   9 Of course, the Court’s assertion that materiality will be resolved on\n\nthe merits presumes that certification will not bring in terrorem settle-\nment pressures to bear, foreclosing any materiality inquiry at all. The\nCourt dismisses this concern, ante, at 18–20, attempting to give fraud-\non-the-market analysis the imprimatur of congressional enactment\ninstead of recognizing it as a judicially created doctrine grafted onto an\nimplied cause of action. But the fact that Congress has enacted legisla-\ntion to curb excesses in securities litigation while leaving Basic intact,\nsee ante, at 19–20, says nothing about the proper interpretation of\nBasic at issue here. The Court retains discretion over the contours of\nBasic unless and until Congress sees fit to alter them—a fact Congress\nmust also have realized when it passed the Private Securities Litiga-\ntion Reform Act of 1995, 109 Stat. 737, and other legislation. The\nCourt’s entire argument is based on the assumption that the fraud-on-\nthe-market presumption need not be shown at certification because it\nwill be proved later on the merits; insofar as certification makes that\nlater determination unlikely to occur, it at least counsels against the\ncertitude with which the Court assures us that its gloss on Basic is\ncorrect.\n12   AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe Rule—that is, he must be prepared to prove that there\nare in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common ques-\ntions of law or fact, etc.” 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nIf the elements of fraud on the market are not proved at\ncertification, a plaintiff has failed to carry his burden of\nestablishing that questions of individualized reliance will\nnot predominate, without which the plaintiff class cannot\nobtain certification. Cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (holding\nin Rule 23(a)(2) context that “[w]ithout some glue hold-\ning the alleged reasons for all those decisions together, it\nwill be impossible to say that examination of all the class\nmembers’ claims for relief will produce a common an-\nswer”). It is only by establishing all of the elements of the\nfraud-on-the-market presumption that reliance can be\nproved on a classwide basis. Therefore, if a plaintiff wishes\nto use Basic’s presumption to prove that reliance is a\ncommon question, he must establish the entire presump-\ntion, including materiality, at the class certification stage.\n   Nor is it relevant, as respondent argues, that requiring\nplaintiffs to establish all predicates of fraud on the market\nat certification will make it more difficult to obtain certifi-\ncation. See Brief for Respondent 35–38. In Basic, four\nJustices of a six-Justice Court created the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption from a combination of newly minted\neconomic theories, 485 U. S., at 250–251, n. 1 (White, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part), and “considera-\ntions of fairness, public policy, and probability,” id., at 245\n(majority opinion), to allow claims that otherwise would\nhave been barred due to the plaintiffs’ inability to show\nreliance, id., at 242. Basic is a judicially invented doctrine\nbased on an economic theory adopted to ease the burden\non plaintiffs bringing claims under an implied cause of\naction. There is nothing untoward about requiring plain-\ntiffs to take the steps that the Basic Court created in an\neffort to save otherwise inadequate claims.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Its shortcomings are further highlighted by\nthe role that materiality played in the pre-Basic develop-\nment of the fraud-on-the-market theory as a condition\nprecedent to showing that there are common questions of\nreliance in the class-action context. Materiality, at the\ntime of certification, has been a driving force behind\nthe theory from the outset. This fact further supports the\nneed to prove materiality at the time the fraud-on-the-\nmarket theory is invoked to show that questions of reli-\nance can be answered on a classwide basis.\n                              A\n   Before Basic, two signposts marked the way for courts\napplying the fraud-on-the-market theory. Both demon-\nstrate that the materiality of an alleged falsehood was not\na mere afterthought but rather one of the primary reasons\nfor allowing traditional proof of reliance to be brushed\naside at certification. This fact weighs strongly in favor of\nthe conclusion that materiality must be resolved at certi-\nfication when the fraud-on-the-market presumption is\ninvoked to show that reliance can be proved on a classwide\nbasis.\n   The first signpost was the Ninth Circuit’s 1975 opinion\nin Blackie, termed by one pre-Basic court the “seminal\nfraud on the market case.” Peil, 806 F. 2d, at 1163, n. 16.\nSee also Basic, supra, at 251, n. 1 (White, J., dissenting)\n(“The earliest Court of Appeals case adopting this theory\ncited by the Court is Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F. 2d 891\n(CA9 1975), cert. denied, 429 U. S. 816 (1976)”).\n   Blackie arose from a $90 million loss reported by audio\nequipment manufacturer Ampex Corp. in its 1972 annual\nreport. 524 F. 2d, at 894.10 Ampex’s independent auditors\n——————\n 10 Ampex’s   sales for 1971 were just under $284 million. See Reckert,\n14    AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                      AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nnot only refused to certify the 1972 annual report but also\nwithdrew certification of all 1971 financial statements\n“because of doubts that the loss reported for 1972 was in\nfact suffered in that year.” Ibid. In resultant class ac-\ntions, the defendants argued that reliance stood in the\nway of class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) because it\nwas not a common question.\n   The Ninth Circuit disagreed. Instead, it relieved plain-\ntiffs from providing traditional proof of reliance, ex-\nplaining that “causation is adequately established in the\nimpersonal stock exchange context by proof of purchase and\nof the materiality of misrepresentations, without direct proof\nof reliance.” Id., at 906 (emphasis added). The court left\nno doubt that the materiality of the $90 million shortfall\nin Ampex’s financial statements was central to its deter-\nmination that reliance could be presumed. It asserted\nthat “[m]ateriality circumstantially establishes the reli-\nance of some market traders and hence the inflation in the\nstock price—when the purchase is made[,] the causational\nchain between defendant’s conduct and plaintiff ’s loss is\nsufficiently established to make out a prima facie case.”\nIbid. Materiality was not merely an important factor that\nallowed reliance to be presumed at certification; materiali-\nty was the factor. It demonstrated that the defendants\nhad committed a fraud on the market, that all putative\nclass plaintiffs had relied on it in purchasing stock, and,\ntherefore, that questions of reliance would be susceptible\nto common answers.11\n——————\nA. & P. Registers Deficit for First Fiscal Quarter, N. Y. Times, July 1,\n1972, p. 30 (discussing Ampex’s revenue and net loss in its 1972 Annual\nReport).\n   11 Blackie’s use of materiality to satisfy reliance for purposes of Rule\n\n23(b)(3) predominance continued to form the foundation for the fraud-\non-the-market concept in subsequent pre-Basic appellate cases. See,\ne.g., Peil v. Speiser, 806 F. 2d 1154, 1161 (CA3 1986) (“[W]e hold that\nplaintiffs who purchase in an open and developed market need not\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                  15\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   The second fraud-on-the-market signpost prior to Basic\nwas a note in the Harvard Law Review, which described\nthe nascent theory. See Note, The Fraud-on-the-Market\nTheory, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1143 (1982) (hereinafter Harv.\nL. Rev. Note). The Sixth Circuit opinion reviewed in Basic\ntermed the Note “[t]he clearest statement of the theory of\npresumption of reliance.” Levinson v. Basic Inc., 786 F. 2d\n741, 750 (1986). Indeed, in the briefing for Basic itself,\nthe plaintiffs, the United States, and plaintiffs’ amicus cited\nthe article repeatedly as an authoritative statement on the\nsubject. See Brief for Respondent 43, n. 18, 46, n. 20 (cited\nin Peil, supra, at 1160), Brief for Securities and Exchange\nCommission as Amicus Curiae 22, n. 25, 24, n. 30, 26, n.\n32, and Brief for Joseph Harris et al. as Amicus Curiae 4,\nn. 2, in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, O. T. 1987, No. 86–279.\n   Like Blackie, the Note also hinged the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption of reliance on proof of materiality.\nHarv. L. Rev. Note 1161 (“In developed markets, which\nare apparently efficient, reliance should be presumed from\nthe materiality of the deception” (emphasis added)). Ulti-\nmately, in language that will be familiar to anyone who\nhas read Basic, the Note formulated a “pivotal assump-\ntion” underlying the fraud-on-the-market theory as the\nbelief that:\n     “market prices respond to information disseminated\n     (or not disseminated) concerning the companies whose\n     securities are traded. In such a setting—often de-\n     scribed as an ‘efficient market’—the reliance of some\n     traders upon a material deception influences market\n——————\nprove direct reliance on defendants' misrepresentations, but can satisfy\ntheir burden of proof on the element of causation by showing that the\ndefendants made material misrepresentations” (footnote omitted));\nPanzirer v. Wolf, 663 F. 2d 365, 368 (CA2 1981) (“Blackie held that the\nmateriality of a fraud creates a presumption of reliance through its\npresumed effect on the market. . . . Our holding is no more than an\nextension of Blackie”).\n16    AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                      AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n     prices and thereby affects even traders who never\n     read or hear of the deception.” Harv. L. Rev. Note\n     1154 (footnote omitted).\n  Again, the materiality of the alleged misstatement was\na key component, without which the market could not be\npresumed to move. As a result, without materiality it is\nimpossible to say that there has been a fraud on the mar-\nket at all, and if that is not the case there is no reason to\nbelieve that the market price at which stock transactions\noccurred was affected by an alleged misstatement or, by\nextension, that any market participants relied on it.\nMateriality should thus be proved when the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption is invoked, or there is no common-\nality with respect to questions of reliance.\n                              B\n   Nor did the importance of materiality diminish in the\nSixth Circuit opinion reviewed in Basic. Rather, the court\nfollowed the path marked by the signposts discussed\nabove. It excused plaintiffs from offering traditional evi-\ndence of reliance, so long as “a defendant is shown to have\nmade a material public misrepresentation that, if relied\non directly, would fraudulently induce an individual to mis-\njudge the value of the stock.” Levinson, 786 F. 2d, at 750\n(emphasis added). The court’s analysis made clear that\nmateriality should be demonstrated at the time the pre-\nsumption was invoked: “In order to invoke the presump-\ntion of reliance based upon the fraud on the market theory,\na plaintiff must allege and prove . . . that the mis-\nrepresentations were material . . . .” Ibid. (citing Blackie,\n524 F. 2d, at 906).\n                            C\n  Finally, the briefing before this Court in Basic itself\nbuilt upon this framework and the foundational principle\nthat materiality is an integral part of the theory. Criti-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            17\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncally, the Basic defendants argued that the plaintiffs could\nnot establish fraud on the market at certification even if\nthe theory were valid because the alleged misstatement\nwas immaterial. They “contrast[ed] the likely market\nimpact of disclosure of the [$90 million Blackie loss] . . .\nwith the disclosure of the information which respondents\ncontend[ed] rendered Basic’s statements materially mis-\nleading.” See Brief for Petitioners in O. T. 1987, No. 86–\n279, p. 42. The Basic defendants concluded that “the\ndifferences between a company’s $90 million loss and a\ncompany’s sporadic contacts with a friendly suitor are sub-\nstantial. . . . [T]he fraud on the market theory, if it has\nvitality, should not be applied in a case such as this.” Id.,\nat 43.\n   In response, the plaintiffs in Basic did not argue that\nthe defendants misunderstood the role of materiality in\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory. They instead advanced a\nnow-foreclosed interpretation of dicta from Eisen v. Car-\nlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 177 (1974):\n    “Petitioners’ final argument—that respondents will be\n    unable to establish that Basic’s repeated false and\n    misleading statements impacted the price of Basic\n    stock over a fourteen month period—represents an ef-\n    fort to litigate the merits of this case on the motion for\n    class certification. . . . As this Court held in Eisen v.\n    Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 177 (1974): ‘We\n    find nothing in either the language or history of Rule\n    23 that gives a court any authority to conduct a pre-\n    liminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to\n    determine whether it may be maintained as a class\n    action.’ ” Brief for Respondents in O. T. 1987, No. 86–\n    279, p. 54.\n  The Court rejected this reading of Eisen two Terms ago,\nexplaining that the very language the Basic plaintiffs\nquoted was “sometimes mistakenly cited” as prohibiting\n18    AMGEN, INC. v.

S., at ___,\nn. 6 (slip op., at 10, n. 6). That reading, the Court ex-\nplained, “is the purest dictum and is contradicted by our\nother cases.” Ibid. The Basic defendants’ reply is con-\nsistent with Wal-Mart:\n     “Putative class representatives, such as respondents,\n     should not be permitted to invoke the fraud on the\n     market theory while, at the same time, arguing that\n     courts may not make any preliminary inquiry into the\n     claimed impact on the market. See, e.g., Resp. Br.,\n     p. 54. By seeking the benefit of the presumption, re-\n     spondents necessarily invite judicial scrutiny of the\n     circumstances in which it is invoked.” Reply Brief for\n     Petitioners in O. T. 1987, No. 86–279, p. 18.\n   Well said. The history of Basic is worth the volume of\nargument offered by the majority. Cf. New York Trust Co.\nv. Eisner, 256 U. S. 345, 349 (1921) (majority opinion of\nHolmes, J.). Materiality was central to the development,\nanalysis, and adoption of the fraud-on-the-market theory\nboth before Basic and in Basic itself. Materiality, there-\nfore, must be demonstrated to prove fraud on the market,\nand until materiality of an alleged misstatement is shown\nthere is no reason to believe that all market participants\nhave relied equally on it. Otherwise individualized ques-\ntions of reliance remain. This history confirms that mate-\nriality must be proved at the time that the theory is\ninvoked—i.e., at certification.\n                             III\n  I, thus, would reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit\nand hold that a plaintiff invoking the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption bears the burden to establish all the ele-\nments of fraud on the market at certification, including\nthe materiality of the alleged misstatement.\n</pre>", "id": 821432, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/02/27/amgen_inc._v._connecticut_retirement_plans_and_trust_funds.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2012                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 5, 2012—Decided February 27, 2013\nTo recover damages in a private securities-fraud action under §10(b) of\n  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange\n  Commission Rule 10b–5, a plaintiff must prove, among other things,\n  reliance on a material misrepresentation or omission made by the de-\n  fendant. Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S. ___, ___.\n  Requiring proof of direct reliance “would place an unnecessarily un-\n  realistic evidentiary burden on [a] plaintiff who has traded on an im-\n  personal market.” Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 245. Thus,\n  this Court has endorsed a “fraud-on-the-market” theory, which per-\n  mits securities-fraud plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of\n  reliance on public, material misrepresentations regarding securities\n  traded in an efficient market. Id., at 241–249. The fraud-on-the-\n  market theory facilitates the certification of securities-fraud class ac-\n  tions by permitting reliance to be proved on a classwide basis.\n     Invoking the fraud-on-the-market theory, respondent Connecticut\n  Retirement Plans and Trust Funds (Connecticut Retirement) sought\n  certification of a securities-fraud class action under Federal Rule of\n  Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) against biotechnology company Amgen Inc.\n  and several of its officers (collectively, Amgen). The District Court\n  certified the class, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Ninth Circuit\n  rejected Amgen’s argument that Connecticut Retirement was re-\n  quired to prove the materiality of Amgen’s alleged misrepresenta-\n  tions and omissions before class certification in order to satisfy Rule\n  23(b)(3)’s requirement that “questions of law or fact common to class\n  members predominate over any questions affecting only individual\n  members.” The Ninth Circuit also held that the District Court did\n  not err in refusing to consider rebuttal evidence that Amgen had pre-\n2       AMGEN, INC. v.

Pp. 9–26.\n    (a) The pivotal inquiry in this case is whether proof of materiality\n is needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the\n class will “predominate over any questions affecting only individual\n members” as the litigation progresses. For two reasons, the answer\n to this question is “no.” First, because materiality is judged accord-\n ing to an objective standard, it can be proved through evidence com-\n mon to the class. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S.\n 438, 445. Thus, it is a common question for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes.\n Second, a failure of proof on the common question of materiality\n would not result in individual questions predominating. Instead, it\n would end the case, for materiality is an essential element of a secu-\n rities-fraud claim. Pp. 9–14.\n    (b) Amgen’s arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 14–\n 24.\n      (1) Amgen points to the Court’s statement in Erica P. John\n Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___, that “securities\n fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke Basic’s\n rebuttable presumption of reliance,” including “that the alleged mis-\n representations were publicly known . . . , that the stock traded in an\n efficient market, and that the relevant transaction took place ‘be-\n tween the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the\n truth was revealed.’ ” If these fraud-on-the-market predicates must\n be proved before class certification, Amgen contends, materiality—\n another fraud-on-the-market predicate—should be treated no differ-\n ently. The Court disagrees. The requirement that a putative class\n representative establish that it executed trades “between the time\n the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was re-\n vealed” relates primarily to the Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) inquiries into\n typicality and adequacy of representation, not to the Rule 23(b)(3)\n predominance inquiry. And unlike materiality, market efficiency and\n the public nature of the alleged misrepresentations are not indispen-\n sable elements of a Rule 10–5 claim. While the failure of common,\n classwide proof of market efficiency or publicity leaves open the pro-\n spect of individualized proof of reliance, the failure of common proof\n on the issue of materiality ends the case for all class members.\n Pp. 15–18.\n      (2) Amgen also contends that “policy considerations” militate in\n favor of requiring precertification proof of materiality. Because class\n certification can exert substantial pressure on the defendant to settle\n rather than risk ruinous liability, Amgen asserts, materiality may\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  never be addressed by a court if it is not required to be evaluated at\n  the class-certification stage. In this regard, however, materiality\n  does not differ from other essential elements of a Rule 10b–5 claim,\n  notably, the requirements that the statements or omissions on which\n  the plaintiff ’s claims are based were false or misleading and that the\n  alleged statements or omissions caused the plaintiff to suffer econom-\n  ic loss. Significantly, while addressing the settlement pressures as-\n  sociated with securities-fraud class actions, Congress has rejected\n  calls to undo the fraud-on-the-market theory. And contrary to\n  Amgen’s argument that requiring proof of materiality before class\n  certification would conserve judicial resources, Amgen’s position\n  would necessitate time and resource intensive mini-trials on materi-\n  ality at the class-certification stage. Pp. 18–22.\n     (c) Also unavailing is Amgen’s claim that the District Court erred\n  by refusing to consider the rebuttal evidence Amgen proffered in op-\n  posing Connecticut Retirement’s class-certification motion. The\n  Ninth Circuit concluded, and Amgen does not contest, that Amgen’s\n  rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the misrepresentations and\n  omissions alleged in Connecticut Retirement’s complaint were imma-\n  terial. The potential immateriality of Amgen’s alleged misrepresen-\n  tations and omissions, however, is no barrier to finding that common\n  questions predominate. Just as a plaintiff class’s inability to prove\n  materiality creates no risk that individual questions will predomi-\n  nate, a definitive rebuttal on the issue of materiality would not un-\n  dermine the predominance of questions common to the class.

Levinson, 485 U. S. 224 (1988), and recog-\nnized most recently in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halli-\nburton Co., 563 U. S. ___ (2011). The fraud-on-the-market\npremise is that the price of a security traded in an efficient\nmarket will reflect all publicly available information about\na company; accordingly, a buyer of the security may be\npresumed to have relied on that information in purchasing\nthe security.\n   Amgen has conceded the efficiency of the market for\nthe securities at issue and has not contested the public\ncharacter of the allegedly fraudulent statements on which\nConnecticut Retirement’s complaint is based. Nor does\nAmgen here dispute that Connecticut Retirement meets\n2     AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nall of the class-action prerequisites stated in Rule 23(a):\n(1) the alleged class “is so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable”; (2) “there are questions of law\nor fact common to the class”; (3) Connecticut Retirement’s\nclaims are “typical of the claims . . . of the class”; and (4)\nConnecticut Retirement will “fairly and adequately protect\nthe interests of the class.”\n  The issue presented concerns the requirement stated in\nRule 23(b)(3) that “the questions of law or fact common to\nclass members predominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members.” Amgen contends that to meet\nthe predominance requirement, Connecticut Retirement\nmust do more than plausibly plead that Amgen’s alleged\nmisrepresentations and misleading omissions materially\naffected Amgen’s stock price. According to Amgen, certifi­\ncation must be denied unless Connecticut Retirement\nproves materiality, for immaterial misrepresentations or\nomissions, by definition, would have no impact on Amgen’s\nstock price in an efficient market.\n  While Connecticut Retirement certainly must prove\nmateriality to prevail on the merits, we hold that such\nproof is not a prerequisite to class certification. Rule\n23(b)(3) requires a showing that questions common to the\nclass predominate, not that those questions will be an­\nswered, on the merits, in favor of the class. Because mate­\nriality is judged according to an objective standard, the\nmateriality of Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations and\nomissions is a question common to all members of the\nclass Connecticut Retirement would represent. The al­\nleged misrepresentations and omissions, whether material\nor immaterial, would be so equally for all investors com­\nposing the class. As vital, the plaintiff class’s inability to\nprove materiality would not result in individual questions\npredominating. Instead, a failure of proof on the issue\nof materiality would end the case, given that materiality\nis an essential element of the class members’ securities­\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfraud claims. As to materiality, therefore, the class is\nentirely cohesive: It will prevail or fail in unison. In no\nevent will the individual circumstances of particular class\nmembers bear on the inquiry.\n   Essentially, Amgen, also the dissenters from today’s\ndecision, would have us put the cart before the horse. To\ngain certification under Rule 23(b)(3), Amgen and the\ndissenters urge, Connecticut Retirement must first estab­\nlish that it will win the fray. But the office of a Rule\n23(b)(3) certification ruling is not to adjudicate the case;\nrather, it is to select the “metho[d]” best suited to adjudi­\ncation of the controversy “fairly and efficiently.”\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   This case involves the interaction between federal\nsecurities-fraud laws and Rule 23’s requirements for\nclass certification. To obtain certification of a class ac-\ntion for money damages under Rule 23(b)(3), a plaintiff\nmust satisfy Rule 23(a)’s above-mentioned prerequisites\nof numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of\nrepresentation, see supra, at 1–2, and must also establish\nthat “the questions of law or fact common to class mem­\nbers predominate over any questions affecting only indi­\nvidual members, and that a class action is superior to\nother available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudi­\ncating the controversy.” To recover damages in a private\nsecurities-fraud action under §10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as amended, 15\nU. S. C. §78j(b) (2006 ed., Supp. V), and Securities and\nExchange Commission Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5\n(2011), a plaintiff must prove “(1) a material misrepresen­\ntation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a\nconnection between the misrepresentation or omission and\nthe purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the\nmisrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6)\n4     AMGEN INC. v.

Accordingly, in Basic the Court endorsed the\n“fraud-on-the-market” theory, which permits certain Rule\n10b–5 plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of\nreliance on material misrepresentations aired to the gen­\neral public. Id., at 241–249.1\n   The fraud-on-the-market theory rests on the premise\nthat certain well developed markets are efficient proces­\nsors of public information.

See R.\nBrealey, S. Myers, & F. Allen, Principles of Corporate\nFinance 330 (10th ed. 2011) (“[I]n an efficient market,\nthere is no way for most investors to achieve consistently\nsuperior rates of return.”).\n  In Basic, we held that if a market is shown to be effi­\ncient, courts may presume that investors who traded\nsecurities in that market relied on public, material mis­\nrepresentations regarding those securities. See 485 U. S.,\nat 245–247. This presumption springs from the very\nconcept of market efficiency. If a market is generally\nefficient in incorporating publicly available information\ninto a security’s market price, it is reasonable to presume\nthat a particular public, material misrepresentation will\nbe reflected in the security’s price. Furthermore, it is\nreasonable to presume that most investors—knowing that\nthey have little hope of outperforming the market in the\nlong run based solely on their analysis of publicly availa­\nble information—will rely on the security’s market price as\nan unbiased assessment of the security’s value in light of\nall public information. Thus, courts may presume that\ninvestors trading in efficient markets indirectly rely on\npublic, material misrepresentations through their “reli­\nance on the integrity of the price set by the market.” Id.,\nat 245. “[T]he presumption,” however, is “just that, and\n[can] be rebutted by appropriate evidence.” Halliburton,\n563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). See also Basic, 485 U.

See Basic, 485 U. S., at\n242.

When the truth came to light, Connecticut Retire­\nment asserts, Amgen’s stock price declined, resulting in\nfinancial losses to those who purchased the stock at the\ninflated price. In its answer to Connecticut Retirement’s\ncomplaint, Amgen conceded that “[a]t all relevant times,\nthe market for [its] securities,” which are traded on the\nNASDAQ stock exchange, “was an efficient market”; thus,\n“the market for Amgen’s securities promptly digested\ncurrent information regarding Amgen from all publicly\n\n——————\n    2 Although describing Basic’s adoption of the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption of reliance as “questionable,” JUSTICE THOMAS’ dissent\nacknowledges that “the Court has not been asked to revisit” that issue.\nPost, at 4–5, n. 4.

After\ngranting Amgen’s request to take an interlocutory appeal\nfrom the District Court’s class-certification order, see Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 23(f), the Court of Appeals affirmed. See\n660 F. 3d 1170 (CA9 2011).\n   Amgen raised two arguments on appeal. First, Amgen\ncontended that the District Court erred by certifying the\nproposed class without first requiring Connecticut Retire­\nment to prove that Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations\nand omissions were material. Second, Amgen argued that\nthe District Court erred by refusing to consider certain\nrebuttal evidence that Amgen had proffered in opposition\nto Connecticut Retirement’s class-certification motion.\nThis evidence, in Amgen’s view, demonstrated that the\nmarket was well aware of the truth regarding its alleged\nmisrepresentations and omissions at the time the class\nmembers purchased their shares.\n   The Court of Appeals rejected both contentions.\nAmgen’s first argument, the Court of Appeals noted, made\nthe uncontroversial point that immaterial misrepresenta­\ntions and omissions “by definition [do] not affect . . . stock\nprice[s] in an efficient market.” Id., at 1175. Thus,\nwhere misrepresentations and omissions are not material,\nthere is no basis for presuming classwide reliance on\nthose misrepresentations and omissions through the\ninformation-processing mechanism of the market price.\n“The problem with that argument,” the Court of Appeals ob­\nserved, is evident: “[B]ecause materiality is an element of\n8    AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                    AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nthe merits of their securities fraud claim, the plaintiffs\ncannot both fail to prove materiality yet still have a viable\nclaim for which they would need to prove reliance individ­\nually.” Ibid. The Court of Appeals thus concluded that\n“proof of materiality is not necessary” to ensure compli­\nance with Rule 23(b)(3)’s requirement that common ques­\ntions predominate. Id., at 1177.\n   With respect to Amgen’s second argument, the Court of\nAppeals determined that Amgen’s proffered rebuttal\nevidence was merely “a method of refuting [the] materi-\nality” of the misrepresentations and omissions alleged\nin Connecticut Retirement’s complaint. Ibid. Having al-\nready concluded that a securities-fraud plaintiff does not\nneed to prove materiality before class certification, the\ncourt similarly held that “the district court correctly re­\nfused to consider” Amgen’s rebuttal evidence “at the class\ncertification stage.” Ibid.\n   We granted Amgen’s petition for certiorari, 567 U. S. ___\n(2012), to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals\nover whether district courts must require plaintiffs to\nprove, and must allow defendants to present evidence\nrebutting, the element of materiality before certifying a\nclass action under §10(b) and Rule 10b–5.

Dukes, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), Rule 23 grants courts no license to engage\nin free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification stage.\nMerits questions may be considered to the extent—but\nonly to the extent—that they are relevant to determining\nwhether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification\nare satisfied. See id., at ___, n. 6 (slip op., at 10, n. 6) (a\ndistrict court has no “ ‘authority to conduct a preliminary\ninquiry into the merits of a suit’ ” at class certification\nunless it is necessary “to determine the propriety of certi­\nfication” (quoting Eisen v.

App.,\np. 144 (“[A]n evaluation of the probable outcome on the\nmerits is not properly part of the certification decision.”).\n   Bearing firmly in mind that the focus of Rule 23(b)(3)\nis on the predominance of common questions, we turn to\nAmgen’s contention that the courts below erred by failing\nto require Connecticut Retirement to prove the material­\nity of Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations and omissions\nbefore certifying Connecticut Retirement’s proposed class.\nAs Amgen notes, materiality is not only an element of the\nRule 10b–5 cause of action; it is also an essential predicate\nof the fraud-on-the-market theory. See Basic, 485 U. S., at\n247 (“[W]here materially misleading statements have been\ndisseminated into an impersonal, well-developed market\n10    AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor securities, the reliance of individual plaintiffs on the\nintegrity of the market price may be presumed.” (emphasis\nadded)). That theory, Amgen correctly observes, is prem­\nised on the understanding that in an efficient market,\nall publicly available information is rapidly incorporated\ninto, and thus transmitted to investors through, the mar­\nket price. See id., at 246–247. Because immaterial in-\nformation, by definition, does not affect market price,\nit cannot be relied upon indirectly by investors who, as\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory presumes, rely on the mar­\nket price’s integrity. Therefore, the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory cannot apply absent a material misrepresentation\nor omission. And without the fraud-on-the-market theory,\nthe element of reliance cannot be proved on a classwide\nbasis through evidence common to the class. See id., at\n242. It thus follows, Amgen contends, that materiality\nmust be proved before a securities-fraud class action can\nbe certified.\n   Contrary to Amgen’s argument, the key question in this\ncase is not whether materiality is an essential predicate of\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory; indisputably it is.4 In­\nstead, the pivotal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is\nneeded to ensure that the questions of law or fact common\nto the class will “predominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members” as the litigation progresses.\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3). For two reasons, the answer\nto this question is clearly “no.”\n\n——————\n  4 We agree with JUSTICE THOMAS that “[m]ateriality was central to\n\nthe development, analysis, and adoption of the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory both before Basic and in Basic itself.” Post, at 18. We disagree,\nhowever, that the history of the fraud-on-the-market theory’s develop­\nment “confirms that materiality must be proved at the time that the\ntheory is invoked—i.e., at certification.” Ibid. As explained below, see\ninfra this page and 11–13, proof of materiality is not required prior to\nclass certification because such proof is not necessary to ensure satis­\nfaction of Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   First, because “[t]he question of materiality . . . is an\nobjective one, involving the significance of an omitted or\nmisrepresented fact to a reasonable investor,” materiality\ncan be proved through evidence common to the class. TSC\nIndustries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 445\n(1976). Consequently, materiality is a “common ques­\ntio[n]” for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3). Basic, 485 U. S., at\n242 (listing “materiality” as one of the questions common\nto the Basic class members).\n   Second, there is no risk whatever that a failure of proof\non the common question of materiality will result in indi­\nvidual questions predominating. Because materiality is\nan essential element of a Rule 10b–5 claim, see Matrixx\nInitiatives, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), Connecticut\nRetirement’s failure to present sufficient evidence of mate­\nriality to defeat a summary-judgment motion or to prevail\nat trial would not cause individual reliance questions to\noverwhelm the questions common to the class. Instead,\nthe failure of proof on the element of materiality would\nend the case for one and for all; no claim would re­\nmain in which individual reliance issues could potentially\npredominate.\n   Totally misapprehending our essential point, JUSTICE\nTHOMAS’ dissent asserts that our “entire argument is\nbased on the assumption that the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption need not be shown at certification because it\nwill be proved later on the merits.” Post, at 11, n. 9. Our\nposition is not so based. We rest, instead, entirely on the\ntext of Rule 23(b)(3), which provides for class certification\nif “the questions of law or fact common to class members\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers.” A failure of proof on the common question of\nmateriality ends the litigation and thus will never cause\nindividual questions of reliance or anything else to over­\nwhelm questions common to the class. Therefore, under\nthe plain language of Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs are not\n12    AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired to prove materiality at the class-certification\nstage. In other words, they need not, at that threshold,\nprove that the predominating question will be answered in\ntheir favor.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS urges that a plaintiff seeking class\ncertification “must show that the elements of [her] claim\nare susceptible to classwide proof.” Post, at 7. See also\npost, at 11 (criticizing the Court for failing to focus its\nanalysis on “whether the element of reliance is susceptible\nto classwide proof ”). From this premise, JUSTICE THOMAS\nconcludes that Rule 10b–5 plaintiffs must prove material-\nity before class certification because (1) “materiality is a\nnecessary component of fraud on the market,” and (2)\nwithout fraud on the market, the Rule 10b–5 element of\nreliance is not “susceptible of a classwide answer.” Post,\nat 6, 10–11. See also post, at 12 (“[I]f a plaintiff wishes to\nuse Basic’s presumption to prove that reliance is a com­\nmon question, he must establish the entire presumption,\nincluding materiality, at the class certification stage.”).\n   Rule 23(b)(3), however, does not require a plaintiff\nseeking class certification to prove that each “elemen[t] of\n[her] claim [is] susceptible to classwide proof.” Post, at 7.\nWhat the rule does require is that common questions\n“predominate over any questions affecting only individual\n[class] members.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3) (emphasis\nadded). Nowhere does JUSTICE THOMAS explain how, in\nan action invoking the Basic presumption, a plaintiff\nclass’s failure to prove an essential element of its claim for\nrelief will result in individual questions predominating\nover common ones. Absent proof of materiality, the claim\nof the Rule 10b–5 class will fail in its entirety; there will\nbe no remaining individual questions to adjudicate.\n   Consequently, proof of materiality is not required to\nestablish that a proposed class is “sufficiently cohesive\nto warrant adjudication by representation”—the focus of\nthe predominance inquiry under Rule 23(b)(3).

No\ndoubt a clever mind could conjure up fantastic scenarios in\nwhich an individual investor might rely on immaterial\ninformation (think of the superstitious investor who sells\nher securities based on a CEO’s statement that a black cat\ncrossed the CEO’s path that morning). But such objectively\nunreasonable reliance does not give rise to a Rule 10b–5\nclaim. See TSC Industries, 426 U. S., at 445 (materiality\nis judged by an objective standard). Thus, “the individual­\nized questions of reliance,” post, at 9, n. 8, that hypotheti­\ncally might arise when a failure of proof on the issue of\nmateriality dooms the fraud-on-the-market class are far\nmore imaginative than real. Such “individualized ques­\ntions” do not undermine class cohesion and thus cannot be\nsaid to “predominate” for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3).5\n   Because the question of materiality is common to the\nclass, and because a failure of proof on that issue would\nnot result in questions “affecting only individual members”\npredominating, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3), Connecticut\nRetirement was not required to prove the materiality of\nAmgen’s alleged misrepresentations and omissions at the\nclass-certification stage. This is not a case in which the\nasserted problem—i.e., that the plaintiff class cannot\nprove materiality—“exhibits some fatal dissimilarity”\namong class members that would make use of the class­\naction device inefficient or unfair. Nagareda, Class Certi­\nfication in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev.\n97, 107 (2009).

Such a contention is\nproperly addressed at trial or in a ruling on a summary­\njudgment motion. The allegation should not be resolved in\ndeciding whether to certify a proposed class. Ibid. See\nalso Schleicher, 618 F. 3d, at 687 (“[W]hether a statement\nis materially false is a question common to all class mem­\nbers and therefore may be resolved on a class-wide basis\nafter certification.”).\n                             B\n  Insisting that materiality must be proved at the class­\ncertification stage, Amgen relies chiefly on two arguments,\nneither of which we find persuasive.6\n——————\n  6 Amgen advances a third argument founded on modern economic\n\nresearch tending to show that market efficiency is not “ ‘a binary, yes or\nno question.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 32 (quoting Langevoort, Basic at\nTwenty: Rethinking Fraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 167).\nInstead, this research suggests, differences in efficiency can exist\nwithin a single market. For example, a market may more readily\nprocess certain forms of widely disseminated and easily digestible\ninformation, such as public merger announcements, than information\nmore difficult to acquire and understand, such as obscure technical\ndata buried in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSee, e.g., Macey & Miller, Good Finance, Bad Economics: An Analysis of\nthe Fraud-on-the-Market Theory, 42 Stan.

Amgen,\nhowever, never clearly explains how this research on market efficiency\nbolsters its argument that courts should require precertification proof\nof materiality. In any event, this case is a poor vehicle for exploring\nwhatever implications the research Amgen cites may have for the\nfraud-on-the-market presumption recognized in Basic. As noted above,\nsee supra, at 6–7, Amgen conceded in its answer that the market for its\nsecurities is “efficient” and thus “promptly digest[s] current information\nregarding Amgen from all publicly available sources and reflect[s] such\ninformation in Amgen’s stock price.” Consolidated Amended Class\nAction Complaint ¶¶199–200; Answer ¶¶199–200.

If these fraud-on-the-market\npredicates must be proved before class certification,\nAmgen contends, materiality—another fraud-on-the­\nmarket predicate—should be treated no differently.\n   We disagree. As an initial matter, the requirement that\na putative class representative establish that it executed\ntrades “between the time the misrepresentations were\nmade and the time the truth was revealed” relates primar­\nily to the Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) inquiries into typicality\nand adequacy of representation, not to the Rule 23(b)(3)\npredominance inquiry.

System v. Southworth,\n529 U. S. 217, 226 (2000))). We thus find nothing in the cited research\nthat would support requiring precertification proof of materiality in this\ncase.\n   7 As earlier noted, see supra, at 1–2, Amgen does not here contest\n16     AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                      AND TRUST FUNDS\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsecurity’s market price cannot be affected by a misrepre­\nsentation not yet made, and in an efficient market, a\nmisrepresentation’s impact on market price is quickly\nnullified once the truth comes to light. Thus, a plaintiff\nwhose relevant transactions were not executed between\nthe time the misrepresentation was made and the time the\ntruth was revealed cannot be said to have indirectly relied\non the misrepresentation through its reliance on the in­\ntegrity of the market price.8 Such a plaintiff ’s claims,\ntherefore, would not be “typical” of the claims of investors\nwho did trade during the window between misrepresenta­\ntion and truth revelation. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(a)(3).\nNor could a court confidently conclude that such a plaintiff\nwould “fairly and adequately protect the interests” of\ninvestors who traded during the relevant window. Rule\n23(a)(4). The requirement that the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory’s trade-timing predicate be established before\nclass certification thus sheds little light on the question\nwhether materiality must also be proved at the class­\ncertification stage.\n   Amgen is not aided by Halliburton’s statement that\nmarket efficiency and the public nature of the alleged\nmisrepresentations must be proved before a securities­\nfraud class action can be certified. As Amgen notes, mar­\nket efficiency, publicity, and materiality can all be proved\non a classwide basis. Furthermore, they are all essential\npredicates of the fraud-on-the-market theory. Unless\n——————\nConnecticut Retirement’s satisfaction of Rule 23(a)’s requirements.\n  8 Accordingly, “the timing of the relevant stock trades” is indeed an\n\n“element” of the fraud-on-the-market theory. Post, at 6, n. 6 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.). Unlike JUSTICE THOMAS, however, see ibid., we do not\nunderstand the United States as amicus curiae to take a different view.\nSee Brief for United States 15, n. 2 (“Precise identification of the times\nwhen the alleged misrepresentation was made and the truth was\nsubsequently revealed is . . . important to ensure that the named\nplaintiff has traded stock during the time the stock price allegedly was\ndistorted by the defendant’s misrepresentations.”).\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthose predicates are established, there is no basis for\npresuming that the defendant’s alleged misrepresenta­\ntions were reflected in the security’s market price, and\nhence no grounding for any contention that investors\nindirectly relied on those misrepresentations through their\nreliance on the integrity of the market price. But unlike\nmateriality, market efficiency and publicity are not indis­\npensable elements of a Rule 10b–5 claim. See Matrixx\nInitiatives, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (listing ele­\nments of a Rule 10b–5 claim). Thus, where the market for\na security is inefficient or the defendant’s alleged misrep­\nresentations were not aired publicly, a plaintiff cannot\ninvoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption. She can,\nhowever, attempt to establish reliance through the “tradi­\ntional” mode of demonstrating that she was personally\n“aware of [the defendant’s] statement and engaged in a\nrelevant transaction . . . based on that specific misrepre­\nsentation.” Halliburton, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\nIndividualized reliance issues would predominate in such\na lawsuit. See Basic, 485 U. S., at 242. The litigation,\ntherefore, could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) as a\nclass action, but the initiating plaintiff ’s claim would\nremain live; it would not be “dead on arrival.” 660 F. 3d,\nat 1175.\n   A failure of proof on the issue of materiality, in contrast,\nnot only precludes a plaintiff from invoking the fraud-on­\nthe-market presumption of classwide reliance; it also\nestablishes as a matter of law that the plaintiff cannot\nprevail on the merits of her Rule 10b–5 claim. Materiality\nthus differs from the market-efficiency and publicity pred­\nicates in this critical respect: While the failure of common,\nclasswide proof on the issues of market efficiency and\npublicity leaves open the prospect of individualized proof\nof reliance, the failure of common proof on the issue of\nmateriality ends the case for the class and for all indi­\nviduals alleged to compose the class. See Brief for United\n18   AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                    AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nStates as Amicus Curiae 20 (“Unless the failure of com-\nmon proof gives rise to a need for individualized proof, it\ndoes not cast doubt on the propriety of class certifica­\ntion.”). In short, there can be no actionable reliance,\nindividually or collectively, on immaterial information. Be-\ncause a failure of proof on the issue of materiality, unlike\nthe issues of market efficiency and publicity, does not give\nrise to any prospect of individual questions overwhelming\ncommon ones, materiality need not be proved prior to Rule\n23(b)(3) class certification.\n                              2\n   Amgen also contends that certain “policy considerations”\nmilitate in favor of requiring precertification proof of\nmateriality. Brief for Petitioners 28. An order granting\nclass certification, Amgen observes, can exert substantial\npressure on a defendant “to settle rather than incur the\ncosts of defending a class action and run the risk of poten­\ntially ruinous liability.” Advisory Committee’s 1998 Note\non subd. (f) of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U. S. C. App.,\np. 143. See also AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion,\n563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16) (class actions\ncan entail a “risk of ‘in terrorem’ settlements”). Absent\na requirement to evaluate materiality at the class­\ncertification stage, Amgen contends, the issue may never\nbe addressed by a court, for the defendant will surrender\nand settle soon after a class is certified. Insistence on\nproof of materiality before certifying a securities-fraud\nclass action, Amgen thus urges, ensures that the issue\nwill be adjudicated and not forgone. See also post, at 4\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (expressing the same concerns).\n   In this regard, however, materiality does not differ from\nother essential elements of a Rule 10b–5 claim, notably,\nthe requirements that the statements or omissions on\nwhich the plaintiff ’s claims are based were false or mis­\nleading and that the alleged statements or omissions\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Settlement\npressure exerted by class certification may prevent judi­\ncial resolution of these issues. Yet this Court has held\nthat loss causation and the falsity or misleading nature of\nthe defendant’s alleged statements or omissions are com­\nmon questions that need not be adjudicated before a class\nis certified. See Halliburton, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n3) (loss causation need not be proved at the class­\ncertification stage); Basic, 485 U. S., at 242 (“the falsity or\nmisleading nature of the . . . public statements” allegedly\nmade by the defendant is a “common questio[n]”). See also\nSchleicher, 618 F. 3d, at 685 (falsity of alleged mis-\nstatements need not be proved before certification of a\nsecurities-fraud class action).\n   Congress, we count it significant, has addressed the\nsettlement pressures associated with securities-fraud class\nactions through means other than requiring proof of mate­\nriality at the class-certification stage. In enacting the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA),\n109 Stat. 737, Congress recognized that although private\nsecurities-fraud litigation furthers important public-policy\ninterests, prime among them, deterring wrongdoing and\nproviding restitution to defrauded investors, such law-\nsuits have also been subject to abuse, including the\n“extract[ion]” of “extortionate ‘settlements’ ” of frivolous\nclaims. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104–369, pp. 31–32 (1995).\nThe PSLRA’s response to the perceived abuses was, inter\nalia, to “impos[e] heightened pleading requirements” for\nsecurities-fraud actions, “limit recoverable damages and\nattorney’s fees, provide a ‘safe harbor’ for forward-looking\nstatements, impose new restrictions on the selection of\n(and compensation awarded to) lead plaintiffs, mandate\nimposition of sanctions for frivolous litigation, and author­\nize a stay of discovery pending resolution of any motion to\ndismiss.” Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v.\n20   AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                    AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nDabit, 547 U. S. 71, 81–82 (2006). See also 15 U. S. C.\n§78u–4 (2006 ed. and Supp. V). Congress later fortified\nthe PSLRA by enacting the Securities Litigation Uniform\nStandards Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 3227, which curtailed\nplaintiffs’ ability to evade the PSLRA’s limitations on\nfederal securities-fraud litigation by bringing class-action\nsuits under state rather than federal law. See 15 U. S. C.\n§78bb(f)(1) (2006 ed.).\n   While taking these steps to curb abusive securities­\nfraud lawsuits, Congress rejected calls to undo the fraud­\non-the-market presumption of classwide reliance endorsed\nin Basic. See Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking\nFraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 153, and n. 8\n(noting that the initial version of H. R. 10, 104th Cong.,\n1st Sess. (1995), an unenacted bill that, like the PSLRA,\nwas designed to curtail abuses in private securities litiga­\ntion, “would have undone Basic”). See also Common Sense\nLegal Reform Act: Hearings before the Subcommittee on\nTelecommunications and Finance of the House Committee\non Commerce, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 92, 236–237, 251–\n252, 272 (1995) (witnesses criticized the fraud-on-the­\nmarket presumption and expressed support for H. R. 10’s\nrequirement that securities-fraud plaintiffs prove direct\nreliance). Nor did Congress decree that securities-fraud\nplaintiffs prove each element of their claim before obtain­\ning class certification. Because Congress has homed in on\nthe precise policy concerns raised in Amgen’s brief, “[w]e\ndo not think it appropriate for the judiciary to make its\nown further adjustments by reinterpreting Rule 23 to\nmake likely success on the merits essential to class certifi­\ncation in securities-fraud suits.” Schleicher, 618 F. 3d, at\n686; cf. Smith v. Bayer Corp., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 17–18) (“Congress’s decision to address the\nrelitigation concerns associated with class actions through\nthe mechanism of removal provides yet another reason for\nfederal courts to adhere in this context to longstanding\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Amgen’s argument, if embraced, would\nnecessitate a mini-trial on the issue of materiality at the\nclass-certification stage. Such preliminary adjudications\nwould entail considerable expenditures of judicial time\nand resources, costs scarcely anticipated by Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(A), which instructs that the\ndecision whether to certify a class action be made “[a]t an\nearly practicable time.” If the class is certified, materiality\nmight have to be shown all over again at trial. And if\ncertification is denied for failure to prove materiality,\nnonnamed class members would not be bound by that\ndetermination. See Smith, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12–18). They would be free to renew the fray, perhaps\nin another forum, perhaps with a stronger showing of\nmateriality.\n   Given the tenuousness of Amgen’s judicial-economy\nargument, Amgen’s policy arguments ultimately return to\nthe contention that private securities-fraud actions should\nbe hemmed in to mitigate their potentially “vexatiou[s]”\ncharacter. Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421\nU. S. 723, 739 (1975). We have already noted what Con­\ngress has done to control exorbitant securities-fraud ac­\ntions. See supra, at 19–20.

We\nhave no warrant to encumber securities-fraud litigation\nby adopting an atextual requirement of precertification\nproof of materiality that Congress, despite its extensive in-\nvolvement in the securities field, has not sanctioned.\n                               C\n   JUSTICE SCALIA acknowledges that proof of materiality\nis not required to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance\nrequirement. See post, at 1. Nevertheless, he maintains\nthat full satisfaction of Rule 23’s requirements is insuffi­\ncient to obtain class certification under Basic. In JUSTICE\nSCALIA’s view, the Court’s decision in Basic established a\nspecial rule: A securities-fraud class action cannot be\ncertified unless all of the prerequisites of the fraud-on-the­\nmarket presumption of reliance, including materiality,\nhave first been established. Post, at 2.\n   The purported rule is JUSTICE SCALIA’s invention. It\ncannot be attributed to anything the Court said in Basic.\nThat decision is best known for its endorsement of the\nfraud-on-the-market theory. But the opinion also estab­\nlished something more. It stated the proper standard for\njudging the materiality of misleading statements regard­\ning the existence and status of preliminary merger discus­\nsions. See 485 U. S., at 230–241, 250 (“Materiality in the\nmerger context depends on the probability that the trans­\naction will be consummated, and its significance to the\n                      Cite as: 568 U.

The District Court in Basic\ncertified a class of investors whose share prices were\nallegedly depressed by misleading statements that dis­\nguised ongoing merger negotiations. Id., at 228. Postcer­\ntification, the court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants on the ground that the alleged misstatements\nwere immaterial as a matter of law. Id., at 228–229. The\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the class certification but re­\nversed the grant of summary judgment. Id., at 229. This\nCourt, in turn, vacated the Court of Appeals’ judgment\nand remanded for further proceedings on the defendants’\nsummary-judgment motion in light of the materiality\nstandard set forth in the Court’s opinion. Id., at 240–241,\n250. Notably, however, we did not disturb the District\nCourt’s class-certification order, which we stated “was\nappropriate when made.” Id., at 250.9\n   If JUSTICE SCALIA were correct that our decision in\nBasic demands proof of materiality before class certifica­\ntion, the Court in Basic should have ordered the lower\ncourts to reconsider on remand both the defendants’ enti­\ntlement to summary judgment and the propriety of class\ncertification. Instead, the Court expressly endorsed the\nDistrict Court’s class-certification order while at the same\ntime recognizing that further proceedings were necessary\nto determine whether the plaintiffs had mustered suffi­\ncient evidence to satisfy the relatively lenient standard for\n——————\n  9 Scouring the Court’s decision in Basic for some semblance of support\n\nfor his position, JUSTICE SCALIA attaches portentous significance to\nBasic’s statement that the District Court’s class-certification order,\nalthough “ ‘appropriate when made,’ ” was “ ‘subject on remand to such\nadjustment, if any, as developing circumstances demand[ed].’ ” Post, at\n2 (quoting Basic, 485 U.

See id., at 41a–42a.\nSee also 69 Fed. Reg. 16582 (2004).\n   The District Court did not err, we agree with the Court\nof Appeals, by disregarding Amgen’s rebuttal evidence in\ndeciding whether Connecticut Retirement’s proposed class\nsatisfied Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement. The\nCourt of Appeals concluded, and Amgen does not contest,\nthat Amgen’s rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the\nmisrepresentations and omissions alleged in Connecticut\nRetirement’s complaint were immaterial.           660 F. 3d,\nat 1177 (characterizing Amgen’s rebuttal evidence as\nan attempt to present a “ ‘truth-on-the-market’ defense,”\nwhich the Court of Appeals explained “is a method of\nrefuting an alleged misrepresentation’s materiality”). See\nalso Reply Brief 17 (Amgen’s evidence was offered to rebut\nthe “materiality predicate” of the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory). As explained above, however, the potential im­\nmateriality of Amgen’s alleged misrepresentations and\nomissions is no barrier to finding that common questions\npredominate. See Part II, supra. If the alleged misrepre­\nsentations and omissions are ultimately found immaterial,\nthe fraud-on-the-market presumption of classwide reliance\nwill collapse. But again, as earlier explained, see supra, at\n10–13, individual reliance questions will not overwhelm\nquestions common to the class, for the class members’\nclaims will have failed on their merits, thus bringing the\nlitigation to a close. Therefore, just as a plaintiff class’s\ninability to prove materiality creates no risk that individ­\nual questions will predominate, so even a definitive rebut­\ntal on the issue of materiality would not undermine the\npredominance of questions common to the class.\n   We recognized as much in Basic itself. A defendant\ncould “rebut the [fraud-on-the-market] presumption of\nreliance,” we observed in Basic, by demonstrating that\n“news of the [truth] credibly entered the market and dissi­\n26     AMGEN INC. v.

This rule is to be found nowhere in the United\nStates Code or in the common law of fraud or deception; it\nwas invented by the Court in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485\nU. S. 224 (1988). Today’s Court applies to that rule the\nprinciples of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), and\nthereby concludes (logically enough) that commonality is\nestablished at the certification stage even when material-\nity has not been shown. That would be a correct procedure\nif Basic meant the rule it announced to govern only the\nquestion of substantive liability—what must be shown in\norder to prevail. If that were so, the new substantive rule,\nlike the more general substantive rule that reliance must\nbe proved, would be subject, at the certification stage, to\nthe commonality analysis of Rule 23(b)(3). In my view,\nhowever, the Basic rule of fraud-on-the-market—a well\nfunctioning market plus purchase or sale in the market\nplus material misrepresentation known to the market\nestablishes a necessary showing of reliance—governs not\nonly the question of substantive liability, but also the\n2    AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nquestion whether certification is proper. All of the ele-\nments of that rule, including materiality, must be estab-\nlished if and when it is relied upon to justify certification.\nThe answer to the question before us today is to be found\nnot in Rule 23(b)(3), but in the opinion of Basic.\n   Basic established a presumption that the misrepresen-\ntation was relied upon, not a mere presumption that the\nplaintiffs relied on the market price. And it established\nthat presumption not just for the question of substantive\nliability but also for the question of certification. “We\ngranted certiorari . . . to determine whether the courts\nbelow properly applied a presumption of reliance in certify-\ning the class, rather than requiring each class member to\nshow direct reliance on Basic’s statements.” 485 U. S., at\n230 (emphasis added). Of course it makes no sense to\n“presume reliance” on the misrepresentation merely be-\ncause the plaintiff relied on the market price, unless the\nalleged misrepresentation would likely have affected the\nmarket price—that is, unless it was material. Thus, as\nJUSTICE THOMAS’ dissent shows, the Basic opinion is shot\nthrough with references to the necessary materiality. The\npresumption of reliance does not apply, and hence neither\nsubstantive liability will attach nor will certification be\nproper, unless materiality is shown. The necessity of\nmateriality for certification is demonstrated by the last\nsentence of the Basic opinion, which comes after the Court\nhas decided to remand the case for reconsideration of\nmateriality under the appropriate legal standard: “The\nDistrict Court’s certification of the class here was appro-\npriate when made but is subject on remand to such ad-\njustment, if any, as developing circumstances demand.”\nId., at 250. Those circumstances are the establishment of\nfacts that rebut the presumption, including of facts that\nshow the misrepresentation was not material, or was not\nknown to the market.\n   The Court argues that if materiality were a predicate to\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncertification on a fraud-on-the-market theory, the Basic\nCourt would not have approved the class certification\norder while remanding for reconsideration of “whether\nthe plaintiffs had mustered sufficient evidence to satisfy\nthe relatively lenient standard for avoiding summary judg-\nment.” See ante, at 23–24. The Court manufactures an\ninconsistency on the basis of doctrine that did not govern\nclass certification at the time of Basic. We recently clari-\nfied that “Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading\nstandard.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 10). But review of the Basic certifi-\ncation order shows that the District Court’s fraud-on-the-\nmarket analysis was based exclusively on the pleadings:\n“[T]he allegations of plaintiffs’ complaint are sufficient to\nbring this section 10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5) claim within the\nso-called ‘fraud on the market’ theory.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, O. T. 1987, No. 86–279,\np. 115a (emphasis added); see also ibid. (citing complaint\nparagraphs as establishing fraud on the market). Under a\npleadings standard, the District Court found that the\nplaintiffs had satisfied Rule 23(b)(3) with regard to fraud\non the market, including its materiality predicate. See id.,\nat 133a (denial of reconsideration) (“This court ruled on\nDecember 10 that transaction causation [i.e., reliance]\ncould be established by the following: proof of a material\nmisrepresentation which affected the market price of the\nstocks with a resulting injury to the plaintiffs” (emphasis\nadded)). Thus, even if the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded\nmateriality that the certification order “was appropriate\nwhen made,” Basic, supra, at 250, the defendants retained\nan opportunity on remand to rebut the pleading in order to\ndefeat certification.*\n——————\n  * As for the Court’s contention that I have “[s]cour[ed] the Court’s\ndecision in Basic” to find “some semblance of support” for my reading of\nthe case, ante, at 23, n. 9: It does not take much scouring to come across\n4     AMGEN, INC. v.

It does an injustice to the Basic Court to presume\nwithout clear evidence—and indeed in the face of language\nto the contrary—that it was establishing a regime in\nwhich not only those market class-action suits that have\nearned the presumption of reliance pass beyond the cru-\ncial certification stage, but all market-purchase and\nmarket-sale class-action suits do so, no matter what the al-\nleged misrepresentation. The opinion need not be read\nthis way, and it should not.\n  The fraud-on-the-market theory approved by Basic en-\nvisions a demonstration of materiality not just for sub-\nstantive recovery but for certification. Today’s holding\ndoes not merely accept what some consider the regrettable\nconsequences of the four-Justice opinion in Basic; it ex-\npands those consequences from the arguably regrettable to\nthe unquestionably disastrous.\n\n\n\n\n—————— \n\nthe Court’s opening statement that “[w]e granted certiorari . . . to\n\ndetermine whether the courts below properly applied a presumption of \n\nreliance in certifying the class.” 485 U.

The Court does so by all but eliminating\nmateriality as one of the predicates of the fraud-on-the-\nmarket theory, which serves as an alternative mode of es-\ntablishing reliance. See Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S.\n224, 241–250 (1988). Without demonstrating materiality\nat certification, plaintiffs cannot establish Basic’s fraud-\non-the-market presumption. Without proof of fraud on the\nmarket, plaintiffs cannot show that otherwise individual-\nized questions of reliance will predominate, as required\nby Rule 23(b)(3). And without satisfying Rule 23(b)(3),\nclass certification is improper. Fraud on the market is\nthus a condition precedent to class certification, without\nwhich individualized questions of reliance will defeat\ncertification.\n   The Court’s opinion depends on the following assump-\ntion: Plaintiffs will either (1) establish materiality at the\nmerits stage, in which case class certification was proper\n2       AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                        AND TRUST FUNDS\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbecause reliance turned out to be a common question, or\n(2) fail to establish materiality, in which case the claim\nwould fail on the merits, notwithstanding the fact that\nthe class should not have been certified in the first place,\nbecause reliance was never a common question. The\nfailure to establish materiality retrospectively confirms\nthat fraud on the market was never established, that\nquestions regarding the element of reliance were not\ncommon under Rule 23(b)(3), and, by extension, that\ncertification was never proper. Plaintiffs cannot be ex-\ncused of their Rule 23 burden to show at certification that\nquestions of reliance are common merely because they\nmight lose later on the merits element of materiality.\nBecause a securities-fraud plaintiff invoking Basic’s fraud-\non-the-market presumption to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3) should\nbe required to prove each of the predicates of that theory\nat certification in order to demonstrate that questions of\nreliance are common to the class, I respectfully dissent.\n                             A\n  We begin with §10 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, 15 U.

The elements of an implied §10(b) cause of action\nfor securities fraud are “ ‘(1) a material misrepresentation\nor omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection\nbetween the misrepresentation or omission and the pur-\nchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrep-\nresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss\ncausation.’ ” Matrixx, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting\nStoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v.

This case concerns the\nreliance element of the §10(b) claim and its interaction\nwith Rule 23(b)(3).\n   To prove reliance, a plaintiff, whether proceeding indi-\nvidually or as a class member, must show that his stock\ntransaction was caused by the specific alleged misstate-\nment. “[P]roof of reliance ensures that there is a proper\n‘connection between a defendant’s misrepresentation and\na plaintiff ’s injury.’ ” Erica P.

John Fund, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (emphasis\nadded). In the face-to-face fraud cases from which securi-\nties claims historically arose, see, e.g., Dura Pharmaceuti-\ncals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 343–344 (2005)\n(discussing common-law roots of securities-fraud actions),\nthis requirement was easily met by showing that the seller\nmade statements directly to the purchaser and that the\npurchaser bought stock in reliance on those statements.\nHowever, in a modern securities market many, if not most,\nindividuals who purchase stock from third parties on an\nimpersonal exchange will be unaware of statements made\nby the issuer of those securities. As a result, such pur-\nchaser-plaintiffs are unable to meet the traditional reli-\nance requirement because they cannot establish that they\n“engaged in a relevant transaction . . . based on [a] specific\nmisrepresentation.” Erica P. John Fund, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 4).\n   This concern was the driving force behind the develop-\nment of the fraud-on-the-market theory adopted in Basic.\nBecause individuals trading stock on an impersonal mar-\nket often cannot show reliance even for purposes of an\nindividual securities-fraud action, Basic permitted “plain-\ntiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance.” Erica\nP.

Justice White’s concerns remain valid\ntoday, but the Court has not been asked to revisit Basic’s fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption. I thus limit my dissent to demonstrating that the\nCourt is not following Basic’s dictates.\n   Moreover, the Court acknowledges there is disagreement as to\nwhether market efficiency is “ ‘ “a binary, yes or no question,” ’ ” or in-\nstead operates differently depending on the information at issue, see\nante, at 14, n. 6 (quoting Brief for Petitioners 32, in turn quoting\nLangevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking Fraud on the Market, 2009\nWis.

See, e.g., ante, at 9 (materiality is “indisputably”\n“an essential predicate of the fraud-on-the-market the-\nory”); Brief for Respondent 29 (“If the statement is not\nmaterially false, then no one in the class can establish\nreliance via the integrity of the market”). The materiality\nof a specific statement is, therefore, essential to the fraud-\non-the-market presumption, which in turn enables a\nplaintiff to prove reliance.\n                             B\n    Basic’s fraud-on-the-market presumption is highly sig-\n——————\n   6 The United States as amicus curiae invokes Rule 23(a)(3) to suggest\n\nthat the third element, the timing of the relevant stock trades, is a\n“limit on the definition of the class.” Brief for United States 15, n. 2.\nBut it is also necessary to establish the timing of the allegedly material,\npublic misstatement made into an allegedly efficient market (as well as\nwhen the fraud ended due to entry of truth on the market) before the\nfraud-on-the-market theory can be evaluated under Rule 23(b)(3).\nThus, the lower court opinion in Basic expressly identified “the time the\nmisrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed” as\npart of fraud on the market. Levinson v. Basic Inc., 786 F. 2d 741, 750\n(CA6 1986). The Basic Court cited the formulation approvingly, 485\nU. S., at 248, n. 27, and recently in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halli-\nburton Co., 563 U. S. ___ (2011), the Court cited the same language as\npart of the “undisputed” elements a securities-fraud plaintiff must\nprove to invoke Basic. 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5–6) (quoting Basic,\nsupra, at 248, n. 27). Unless the timing of the misrepresentation and\ntruth is established at certification, there is no framework within which\nto determine whether fraud on the market renders reliance a common\nquestion. Thus, insofar as the majority recognizes that timing is a\nfactor of the fraud-on-the-market theory, ante, at 16, n. 8, I agree. It\nwould be incorrect to suggest that timing solely relates to Rules 23(a)(3)\nand (4). It is equally important to establish the timing range at certifi-\ncation for Rule 23(b)(3) reliance purposes. This fact undercuts the\nmajority’s attempt to isolate materiality as the only factor of fraud on\nthe market that need not be shown at certification to demonstrate that\nreliance is a common question.\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

See, e.g., Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___, n. 6 (2011)\n(slip op., at 11, n. 6) (“[P]laintiffs seeking 23(b)(3) certifi-\ncation must prove that their shares were traded on an ef-\nficient market,” an element of the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory (emphasis added)).

S., at 242 (“Requiring proof of\nindividualized reliance from each member of the proposed\nplaintiff class effectively would have prevented respond-\nents from proceeding with a class action, since individual\nissues then would have overwhelmed the common ones”).\n   The Court’s solution in Basic was to allow putative class\nmembers to prove reliance through the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption. Id., at 241–250. As the Court today\nrecognizes, failure to establish fraud on the market “leaves\nopen the prospect of individualized proof of reliance.”\nAnte, at 17. Notably, the Court and the Ninth Circuit both\nacknowledge that in order to obtain the benefit of the\npresumption, plaintiffs must establish two of the fraud-on-\nthe-market predicates at class certification: (1) that the\nmarket was generally efficient, and (2) that the alleged\nmisstatement was public. See ante, at 16 (acknowledging\n“that market efficiency and the public nature of the alleged\nmisrepresentations must be proved before a securities-\nfraud class action can be certified”); 660 F. 3d 1170, 1175\n(CA9 2011) (same). See also Erica P. John Fund, 563\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (“It is undisputed that\nsecurities fraud plaintiffs must prove,” at certification\ninter alia, “that the alleged misrepresentations were pub-\nlicly known . . . [and] that the stock traded in an efficient\nmarket”). The Court is correct insofar as its statements\nrecognize that fraud on the market is a condition prece-\ndent to showing that there are common questions of reli-\nance at the time of class certification.\n   Nevertheless, the Court asserts that materiality—by its\nown admission an essential predicate to invoking fraud\non the market—need not be established at certification\nbecause it will ultimately be proved at the merits stage.\n                      Cite as: 568 U.

This assertion is an express admission\nthat parties will not know at certification whether reliance\nis an individual or common question.\n   To support its position, the Court transforms the predi-\ncate certification inquiry into a novel either-or inquiry\noccurring much later on the merits. According to the\nCourt, either (1) plaintiffs will prove materiality on the\nmerits, thus demonstrating ex post that common questions\npredominated at certification, or (2) they will fail to prove\nmateriality, at which point we learn ex post that certifica-\ntion was inappropriate because reliance was not, in fact, a\ncommon question. In the Court’s second scenario, fraud\non the market was never established, reliance for each\nclass member was inherently individualized, and Rule\n23(b)(3) in fact should have barred certification long ago.8\nThe Court suggests that the problem created by the second\nscenario is excusable because the plaintiffs will lose any-\nway on alternative merits grounds, and the case will be\n\n——————\n   8 The majority ignores this explanation of the fundamental flaw in\n\nits position, asserting that I never “explain how . . . a plaintiff class’s\nfailure to prove an essential element of its claim for relief will result in\nindividual questions predominating over common ones.” Ante, at 12.\nBut a plaintiff, who is excused from his burden of showing, at certifi-\ncation that reliance is a common question, fails to demonstrate that\ncommon questions predominate over the individualized questions of re-\nliance that are inherent in a securities fraud claim. A plaintiff must\ncarry this burden at certification for certification to be proper. The\nmajority does not respond to the inherent timing problem in its posi-\ntion. It does not explain how ignoring questions of reliance—that\nundeniably will be individualized in some cases—at certification is\njustified by the fact that those questions will be resolved months or\nyears later on the merits in a way that indicates reliance was indeed an\nindividualized question all along. Far from obeying the dictates of Rule\n23(b)(3) as it claims, ante, at 12–13, the majority unjustifiably puts off a\ncritical part of the Rule 23(b)(3) inquiry until the merits. The only way\nthe majority can purport to follow Rule 23(b)(3) is by ignoring the fact\nthat, under its own analysis, reliance may be an individualized ques-\ntion that predominates over common questions at certification.\n10   AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nover. See ante, at 17 (“[F]ailure of proof on the issue of\nmateriality [at the merits stage] . . . not only precludes a\nplaintiff from invoking the fraud-on-the-market presump-\ntion of classwide reliance; it also establishes as a matter of\nlaw that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the merits of her\nRule 10b–5 claim”). But nothing in logic or precedent\njustifies ignoring at certification whether reliance is sus-\nceptible to Rule 23(b)(3) classwide proof simply because\none predicate of reliance—materiality—will be resolved, if\nat all, much later in the litigation on an independent\nmerits element.\n   It is the Court, not Amgen, that “would have us put the\ncart before the horse,” ante, at 3, by jumping chronologi-\ncally to the §10(b) merits element of materiality. But Rule\n23, as well as common sense, requires class certification\nissues to be addressed first. See Rule 23(c)(1)(A) (“At an\nearly practicable time after a person sues or is sued . . .\nthe court must determine by order whether to certify the\naction as a class action”). A plaintiff who cannot prove\nmateriality does not simply have a claim that is “ ‘dead on\narrival’ ” at the merits, ante, at 17 (quoting 660 F. 3d, at\n1175); he has a class that should never have arrived at the\nmerits at all because it failed Rule 23(b)(3) certification\nfrom the outset. Without materiality, there is no fraud-\non-the-market presumption, questions of reliance remain\nindividualized, and Rule 23(b)(3) certification is impossi-\nble. And the fact that evidence of materiality goes to both\nfraud on the market at certification and an independent\nmerits element is no issue; Wal-Mart expressly held that a\ncourt at certification may inquire into questions that also\nhave later relevance on the merits. See 564 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 10–11). The Court reverses that inquiry,\neffectively saying that certification may be put off until\nlater because an adverse merits determination will retro-\nactively wipe out the entire class. However, a plaintiff\nwho cannot prove materiality cannot prove fraud on the\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Ante, at 10 (“[T]he piv-\notal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is needed to\nensure that the questions of law or fact common to the\nclass will ‘predominate’ ”). The result is that the Court\neffectively equates §10(b) materiality with fraud-on-the-\nmarket materiality and elides reliance as a §10(b) ele-\nment. But a plaintiff seeking certification under Rule 23\nbears the burden of proof with regard to all the elements\nof a §10(b) claim, which includes materiality and reliance.\nAs Wal-Mart explained, “[a] party seeking class certifica-\ntion must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with\n——————\n   9 Of course, the Court’s assertion that materiality will be resolved on\n\nthe merits presumes that certification will not bring in terrorem settle-\nment pressures to bear, foreclosing any materiality inquiry at all. The\nCourt dismisses this concern, ante, at 18–20, attempting to give fraud-\non-the-market analysis the imprimatur of congressional enactment\ninstead of recognizing it as a judicially created doctrine grafted onto an\nimplied cause of action. But the fact that Congress has enacted legisla-\ntion to curb excesses in securities litigation while leaving Basic intact,\nsee ante, at 19–20, says nothing about the proper interpretation of\nBasic at issue here. The Court retains discretion over the contours of\nBasic unless and until Congress sees fit to alter them—a fact Congress\nmust also have realized when it passed the Private Securities Litiga-\ntion Reform Act of 1995, 109 Stat. 737, and other legislation. The\nCourt’s entire argument is based on the assumption that the fraud-on-\nthe-market presumption need not be shown at certification because it\nwill be proved later on the merits; insofar as certification makes that\nlater determination unlikely to occur, it at least counsels against the\ncertitude with which the Court assures us that its gloss on Basic is\ncorrect.\n12   AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe Rule—that is, he must be prepared to prove that there\nare in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common ques-\ntions of law or fact, etc.” 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nIf the elements of fraud on the market are not proved at\ncertification, a plaintiff has failed to carry his burden of\nestablishing that questions of individualized reliance will\nnot predominate, without which the plaintiff class cannot\nobtain certification. Cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (holding\nin Rule 23(a)(2) context that “[w]ithout some glue hold-\ning the alleged reasons for all those decisions together, it\nwill be impossible to say that examination of all the class\nmembers’ claims for relief will produce a common an-\nswer”). It is only by establishing all of the elements of the\nfraud-on-the-market presumption that reliance can be\nproved on a classwide basis. Therefore, if a plaintiff wishes\nto use Basic’s presumption to prove that reliance is a\ncommon question, he must establish the entire presump-\ntion, including materiality, at the class certification stage.\n   Nor is it relevant, as respondent argues, that requiring\nplaintiffs to establish all predicates of fraud on the market\nat certification will make it more difficult to obtain certifi-\ncation. See Brief for Respondent 35–38. In Basic, four\nJustices of a six-Justice Court created the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption from a combination of newly minted\neconomic theories, 485 U. S., at 250–251, n. 1 (White, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part), and “considera-\ntions of fairness, public policy, and probability,” id., at 245\n(majority opinion), to allow claims that otherwise would\nhave been barred due to the plaintiffs’ inability to show\nreliance, id., at 242. Basic is a judicially invented doctrine\nbased on an economic theory adopted to ease the burden\non plaintiffs bringing claims under an implied cause of\naction. There is nothing untoward about requiring plain-\ntiffs to take the steps that the Basic Court created in an\neffort to save otherwise inadequate claims.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Its shortcomings are further highlighted by\nthe role that materiality played in the pre-Basic develop-\nment of the fraud-on-the-market theory as a condition\nprecedent to showing that there are common questions of\nreliance in the class-action context. Materiality, at the\ntime of certification, has been a driving force behind\nthe theory from the outset. This fact further supports the\nneed to prove materiality at the time the fraud-on-the-\nmarket theory is invoked to show that questions of reli-\nance can be answered on a classwide basis.\n                              A\n   Before Basic, two signposts marked the way for courts\napplying the fraud-on-the-market theory. Both demon-\nstrate that the materiality of an alleged falsehood was not\na mere afterthought but rather one of the primary reasons\nfor allowing traditional proof of reliance to be brushed\naside at certification. This fact weighs strongly in favor of\nthe conclusion that materiality must be resolved at certi-\nfication when the fraud-on-the-market presumption is\ninvoked to show that reliance can be proved on a classwide\nbasis.\n   The first signpost was the Ninth Circuit’s 1975 opinion\nin Blackie, termed by one pre-Basic court the “seminal\nfraud on the market case.” Peil, 806 F. 2d, at 1163, n. 16.\nSee also Basic, supra, at 251, n. 1 (White, J., dissenting)\n(“The earliest Court of Appeals case adopting this theory\ncited by the Court is Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F. 2d 891\n(CA9 1975), cert. denied, 429 U. S. 816 (1976)”).\n   Blackie arose from a $90 million loss reported by audio\nequipment manufacturer Ampex Corp. in its 1972 annual\nreport. 524 F. 2d, at 894.10 Ampex’s independent auditors\n——————\n 10 Ampex’s   sales for 1971 were just under $284 million. See Reckert,\n14    AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                      AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nnot only refused to certify the 1972 annual report but also\nwithdrew certification of all 1971 financial statements\n“because of doubts that the loss reported for 1972 was in\nfact suffered in that year.” Ibid. In resultant class ac-\ntions, the defendants argued that reliance stood in the\nway of class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) because it\nwas not a common question.\n   The Ninth Circuit disagreed. Instead, it relieved plain-\ntiffs from providing traditional proof of reliance, ex-\nplaining that “causation is adequately established in the\nimpersonal stock exchange context by proof of purchase and\nof the materiality of misrepresentations, without direct proof\nof reliance.” Id., at 906 (emphasis added). The court left\nno doubt that the materiality of the $90 million shortfall\nin Ampex’s financial statements was central to its deter-\nmination that reliance could be presumed. It asserted\nthat “[m]ateriality circumstantially establishes the reli-\nance of some market traders and hence the inflation in the\nstock price—when the purchase is made[,] the causational\nchain between defendant’s conduct and plaintiff ’s loss is\nsufficiently established to make out a prima facie case.”\nIbid. Materiality was not merely an important factor that\nallowed reliance to be presumed at certification; materiali-\nty was the factor. It demonstrated that the defendants\nhad committed a fraud on the market, that all putative\nclass plaintiffs had relied on it in purchasing stock, and,\ntherefore, that questions of reliance would be susceptible\nto common answers.11\n——————\nA. & P. Registers Deficit for First Fiscal Quarter, N. Y. Times, July 1,\n1972, p. 30 (discussing Ampex’s revenue and net loss in its 1972 Annual\nReport).\n   11 Blackie’s use of materiality to satisfy reliance for purposes of Rule\n\n23(b)(3) predominance continued to form the foundation for the fraud-\non-the-market concept in subsequent pre-Basic appellate cases. See,\ne.g., Peil v. Speiser, 806 F. 2d 1154, 1161 (CA3 1986) (“[W]e hold that\nplaintiffs who purchase in an open and developed market need not\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

See Note, The Fraud-on-the-Market\nTheory, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1143 (1982) (hereinafter Harv.\nL. Rev. Note). The Sixth Circuit opinion reviewed in Basic\ntermed the Note “[t]he clearest statement of the theory of\npresumption of reliance.” Levinson v. Basic Inc., 786 F. 2d\n741, 750 (1986). Indeed, in the briefing for Basic itself,\nthe plaintiffs, the United States, and plaintiffs’ amicus cited\nthe article repeatedly as an authoritative statement on the\nsubject. See Brief for Respondent 43, n. 18, 46, n. 20 (cited\nin Peil, supra, at 1160), Brief for Securities and Exchange\nCommission as Amicus Curiae 22, n. 25, 24, n. 30, 26, n.\n32, and Brief for Joseph Harris et al. as Amicus Curiae 4,\nn. 2, in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, O. T. 1987, No. 86–279.\n   Like Blackie, the Note also hinged the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption of reliance on proof of materiality.\nHarv. L. Rev. Note 1161 (“In developed markets, which\nare apparently efficient, reliance should be presumed from\nthe materiality of the deception” (emphasis added)). Ulti-\nmately, in language that will be familiar to anyone who\nhas read Basic, the Note formulated a “pivotal assump-\ntion” underlying the fraud-on-the-market theory as the\nbelief that:\n     “market prices respond to information disseminated\n     (or not disseminated) concerning the companies whose\n     securities are traded. In such a setting—often de-\n     scribed as an ‘efficient market’—the reliance of some\n     traders upon a material deception influences market\n——————\nprove direct reliance on defendants' misrepresentations, but can satisfy\ntheir burden of proof on the element of causation by showing that the\ndefendants made material misrepresentations” (footnote omitted));\nPanzirer v. Wolf, 663 F. 2d 365, 368 (CA2 1981) (“Blackie held that the\nmateriality of a fraud creates a presumption of reliance through its\npresumed effect on the market. . . . Our holding is no more than an\nextension of Blackie”).\n16    AMGEN, INC. v.

L. Rev. Note\n     1154 (footnote omitted).\n  Again, the materiality of the alleged misstatement was\na key component, without which the market could not be\npresumed to move. As a result, without materiality it is\nimpossible to say that there has been a fraud on the mar-\nket at all, and if that is not the case there is no reason to\nbelieve that the market price at which stock transactions\noccurred was affected by an alleged misstatement or, by\nextension, that any market participants relied on it.\nMateriality should thus be proved when the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption is invoked, or there is no common-\nality with respect to questions of reliance.\n                              B\n   Nor did the importance of materiality diminish in the\nSixth Circuit opinion reviewed in Basic. Rather, the court\nfollowed the path marked by the signposts discussed\nabove. It excused plaintiffs from offering traditional evi-\ndence of reliance, so long as “a defendant is shown to have\nmade a material public misrepresentation that, if relied\non directly, would fraudulently induce an individual to mis-\njudge the value of the stock.” Levinson, 786 F. 2d, at 750\n(emphasis added). The court’s analysis made clear that\nmateriality should be demonstrated at the time the pre-\nsumption was invoked: “In order to invoke the presump-\ntion of reliance based upon the fraud on the market theory,\na plaintiff must allege and prove . . . that the mis-\nrepresentations were material . . . .” Ibid. (citing Blackie,\n524 F. 2d, at 906).\n                            C\n  Finally, the briefing before this Court in Basic itself\nbuilt upon this framework and the foundational principle\nthat materiality is an integral part of the theory.

S. ____ (2013)            17\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncally, the Basic defendants argued that the plaintiffs could\nnot establish fraud on the market at certification even if\nthe theory were valid because the alleged misstatement\nwas immaterial. They “contrast[ed] the likely market\nimpact of disclosure of the [$90 million Blackie loss] . . .\nwith the disclosure of the information which respondents\ncontend[ed] rendered Basic’s statements materially mis-\nleading.” See Brief for Petitioners in O. T. 1987, No. 86–\n279, p. 42. The Basic defendants concluded that “the\ndifferences between a company’s $90 million loss and a\ncompany’s sporadic contacts with a friendly suitor are sub-\nstantial. . . . [T]he fraud on the market theory, if it has\nvitality, should not be applied in a case such as this.” Id.,\nat 43.\n   In response, the plaintiffs in Basic did not argue that\nthe defendants misunderstood the role of materiality in\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory. They instead advanced a\nnow-foreclosed interpretation of dicta from Eisen v. Car-\nlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 177 (1974):\n    “Petitioners’ final argument—that respondents will be\n    unable to establish that Basic’s repeated false and\n    misleading statements impacted the price of Basic\n    stock over a fourteen month period—represents an ef-\n    fort to litigate the merits of this case on the motion for\n    class certification. . . . As this Court held in Eisen v.\n    Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.
