GREG KNOWLES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 19, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) provides\nthat the federal “district courts shall have original juris-\ndiction” over a civil “class action” if, among other things,\nthe “matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of\n$5,000,000.” 28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2), (5). The statute\nadds that “to determine whether the matter in controversy\nexceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000,” the “claims of\nthe individual class members shall be aggregated.”\n§1332(d)(6).\n  The question presented concerns a class-action plaintiff\nwho stipulates, prior to certification of the class, that he,\nand the class he seeks to represent, will not seek damages\nthat exceed $5 million in total. Does that stipulation\nremove the case from CAFA’s scope? In our view, it does\nnot.\n                            I\n  In April 2011 respondent, Greg Knowles, filed this\nproposed class action in an Arkansas state court against\npetitioner, the Standard Fire Insurance Company.\nKnowles claimed that, when the company had made cer-\n2           STANDARD FIRE INS. CO. v. KNOWLES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntain homeowner’s insurance loss payments, it had un-\nlawfully failed to include a general contractor fee. And\nKnowles sought to certify a class of “hundreds, and pos-\nsibly thousands” of similarly harmed Arkansas policyhold-\ners. App. to Pet. for Cert. 66. In describing the relief\nsought, the complaint says that the “Plaintiff and Class\nstipulate they will seek to recover total aggregate damages\nof less than five million dollars.” Id., at 60. An attached\naffidavit stipulates that Knowles “will not at any time\nduring this case . . . seek damages for the class . . . in\nexcess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate.” Id., at 75.\n   On May 18, 2011, the company, pointing to CAFA’s\njurisdictional provision, removed the case to Federal Dis-\ntrict Court. See 28 U. S. C. §1332(d); §1453. Knowles\nargued for remand on the ground that the District Court\nlacked jurisdiction. He claimed that the “sum or value” of\nthe “amount in controversy” fell beneath the $5 million\nthreshold. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. On the basis of evi-\ndence presented by the company, the District Court found\nthat that the “sum or value” of the “amount in contro-\nversy” would, in the absence of the stipulation, have fallen\njust above the $5 million threshold. Id., at 2, 8. Nonethe-\nless, in light of Knowles’ stipulation, the court concluded\nthat the amount fell beneath the threshold. The court con-\nsequently ordered the case remanded to the state court.\nId., at 15.\n   The company appealed from the remand order, but the\nEighth Circuit declined to hear the appeal. Id., at 1. See\n28 U. S. C. §1453(c)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (providing\ndiscretion to hear an appeal from a remand order). The\ncompany petitioned for a writ of certiorari. And, in light of\ndivergent views in the lower courts, we granted the writ.\nCompare Frederick v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 683\nF. 3d 1242, 1247 (CA10 2012) (a proposed class-action\nrepresentative’s “attempt to limit damages in the com-\nplaint is not dispositive when determining the amount in\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncontroversy”); with Rolwing v. Nestle Holdings, Inc.,\n666 F. 3d 1069, 1072 (CA8 2012) (a precertification “bind-\ning stipulation limiting damages sought to an amount\nnot exceeding $5 million can be used to defeat CAFA\njurisdiction”).\n                              II\n  CAFA provides the federal district courts with “original\njurisdiction” to hear a “class action” if the class has more\nthan 100 members, the parties are minimally diverse, and\nthe “matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of\n$5,000,000.” 28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2), (5)(B). To “deter-\nmine whether the matter in controversy” exceeds that\nsum, “the claims of the individual class members shall\nbe aggregated.” §1332(d)(6). And those “class members”\ninclude “persons (named or unnamed) who fall within the\ndefinition of the proposed or certified class.” §1332(d)\n(1)(D) (emphasis added).\n  As applied here, the statute tells the District Court to\ndetermine whether it has jurisdiction by adding up the\nvalue of the claim of each person who falls within the\ndefinition of Knowles’ proposed class and determine\nwhether the resulting sum exceeds $5 million. If so, there\nis jurisdiction and the court may proceed with the case.\nThe District Court in this case found that resulting sum\nwould have exceeded $5 million but for the stipulation.\nAnd we must decide whether the stipulation makes a\ncritical difference.\n  In our view, it does not. Our reason is a simple one:\nStipulations must be binding. See 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence\n§2588, p. 821 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1981) (defining a “judicial\nadmission or stipulation” as an “express waiver made . . .\nby the party or his attorney conceding for the purposes of\nthe trial the truth of some alleged fact” (emphasis deleted));\nChristian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal., Hast-\nings College of Law v. Martinez, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n4           STANDARD FIRE INS. CO. v. KNOWLES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(slip op., at 10) (describing a stipulation as “ ‘binding and\nconclusive’ ” and “ ‘not subject to subsequent variation’ ”\n(quoting 83 C. J. S., Stipulations §93 (2000))); 9 Wigmore,\nsupra, §2590, at 822 (the “vital feature” of a judicial ad-\nmission is “universally conceded to be its conclusiveness\nupon the party making it”). The stipulation Knowles prof-\nfered to the District Court, however, does not speak for\nthose he purports to represent.\n   That is because a plaintiff who files a proposed class\naction cannot legally bind members of the proposed class\nbefore the class is certified. See Smith v. Bayer Corp., 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 15) (“Neither a proposed\nclass action nor a rejected class action may bind nonpar-\nties”); id., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (“ ‘[A] nonnamed class\nmember is [not] a party to the class-action litigation before\nthe class is certified’ ” (quoting Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536\nU. S. 1, 16, n. 1 (2002) (SCALIA, J., dissenting))); Brief for\nRespondent 12 (conceding that “a damages limitation . . .\ncannot have a binding effect on the merits of absent class\nmembers’ claims unless and until the class is certified”).\n   Because his precertification stipulation does not bind\nanyone but himself, Knowles has not reduced the value\nof the putative class members’ claims. For jurisdictional\npurposes, our inquiry is limited to examining the case “as\nof the time it was filed in state court,” Wisconsin Dept.\nof Corrections v. Schacht, 524 U. S. 381, 390 (1998). At\nthat point, Knowles lacked the authority to concede the\namount-in-controversy issue for the absent class members.\nThe Federal District Court, therefore, wrongly concluded\nthat Knowles’ precertification stipulation could overcome\nits finding that the CAFA jurisdictional threshold had\nbeen met.\n\n  Knowles concedes that “[f]ederal jurisdiction cannot be\nbased on contingent future events.” Brief for Respondent\n20. Yet the two legal principles to which we have just\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreferred—that stipulations must be binding and that a\nnamed plaintiff cannot bind precertification class mem-\nbers—mean that the amount to which Knowles has stipu-\nlated is in effect contingent.\n   If, for example, as Knowles’ complaint asserts, “hun-\ndreds, and possibly thousands” of persons in Arkansas\nhave similar claims, App. to Pet. for Cert. 66, and if each\nof those claims places a significant sum in controversy, the\nstate court might certify the class and permit the case to\nproceed, but only on the condition that the stipulation be\nexcised. Or a court might find that Knowles is an inade-\nquate representative due to the artificial cap he purports\nto impose on the class’ recovery. E.g., Back Doctors Ltd. v.\nMetropolitan Property & Cas. Ins. Co., 637 F. 3d 827, 830–\n831 (CA7 2011) (noting a class representative’s fiduciary\nduty not to “throw away what could be a major component\nof the class’s recovery”). Similarly, another class mem-\nber could intervene with an amended complaint (without\na stipulation), and the District Court might permit the\naction to proceed with a new representative. See 5 A.\nConte & H. Newberg, Class Actions §16:7, p. 154 (4th ed.\n2002) (“[M]embers of a class have a right to intervene if\ntheir interests are not adequately represented by existing\nparties”). Even were these possibilities remote in Knowles’\nown case, there is no reason to think them farfetched in\nother cases where similar stipulations could have more\ndramatic amount-lowering effects.\n   The strongest counterargument, we believe, takes a syl-\nlogistic form: First, this complaint contains a presently\nnonbinding stipulation that the class will seek damages\nthat amount to less than $5 million. Second, if the state\ncourt eventually certifies that class, the stipulation will\nbind those who choose to remain as class members. Third,\nif the state court eventually insists upon modification of\nthe stipulation (thereby permitting class members to\nobtain more than $5 million), it will have in effect created\n6           STANDARD FIRE INS. CO. v. KNOWLES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na new, different case. Fourth, CAFA, however, permits the\nfederal court to consider only the complaint that the plain-\ntiff has filed, i.e., this complaint, not a new, modified (or\namended) complaint that might eventually emerge.\n   Our problem with this argument lies in its conclusion.\nWe do not agree that CAFA forbids the federal court to\nconsider, for purposes of determining the amount in con-\ntroversy, the very real possibility that a nonbinding,\namount-limiting, stipulation may not survive the class\ncertification process. This potential outcome does not re-\nsult in the creation of a new case not now before the\nfederal court. To hold otherwise would, for CAFA jurisdic-\ntional purposes, treat a nonbinding stipulation as if it\nwere binding, exalt form over substance, and run directly\ncounter to CAFA’s primary objective: ensuring “Federal\ncourt consideration of interstate cases of national impor-\ntance.” §2(b)(2), 119 Stat. 5. It would also have the ef-\nfect of allowing the subdivision of a $100 million action\ninto 21 just-below-$5-million state-court actions simply by\nincluding nonbinding stipulations; such an outcome would\nsquarely conflict with the statute’s objective.\n\n  We agree with Knowles that a federal district court\nmight find it simpler to value the amount in controversy\non the basis of a stipulation than to aggregate the value of\nthe individual claims of all who meet the class description.\nWe also agree that, when judges must decide jurisdictional\nmatters, simplicity is a virtue. See Hertz Corp. v. Friend,\n559 U. S. 77, 94 (2010). But to ignore a nonbinding stipu-\nlation does no more than require the federal judge to do\nwhat she must do in cases without a stipulation and what\nthe statute requires, namely “aggregat[e]” the “claims of\nthe individual class members.” 28 U. S. C. §1332(d)(6).\n  Knowles also points out that federal courts permit indi-\nvidual plaintiffs, who are the masters of their complaints,\nto avoid removal to federal court, and to obtain a remand\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto state court, by stipulating to amounts at issue that fall\nbelow the federal jurisdictional requirement. That is so.\nSee St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303\nU. S. 283, 294 (1938) (“If [a plaintiff] does not desire to try\nhis case in the federal court he may resort to the expedi-\nent of suing for less than the jurisdictional amount, and\nthough he would be justly entitled to more, the defendant\ncannot remove”). But the key characteristic about those\nstipulations is that they are legally binding on all plain-\ntiffs. See 14AA C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Fed-\neral Practice and Procedure §3702.1, p. 335 (4th ed. 2011)\n(federal court, as condition for remand, can insist on a\n“binding affidavit or stipulation that the plaintiff will\ncontinue to claim less than the jurisdictional amount” (em-\nphasis added)). That essential feature is missing here, as\nKnowles cannot yet bind the absent class.\n   Knowles argues in the alternative that a stipulation is\nbinding to the extent it limits attorney’s fees so that the\namount in controversy remains below the CAFA thresh-\nold. We do not consider this issue because Knowles’ stipu-\nlation did not provide for that option.\n\n   In sum, the stipulation at issue here can tie Knowles’\nhands, but it does not resolve the amount-in-controversy\nquestion in light of his inability to bind the rest of the\nclass. For this reason, we believe the District Court, when\nfollowing the statute to aggregate the proposed class\nmembers’ claims, should have ignored that stipulation.\nBecause it did not, we vacate the judgment below and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 855517, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/03/19/standard_fire_ins._co._v._knowles.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2012                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

GREG KNOWLES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 19, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) provides\nthat the federal “district courts shall have original juris-\ndiction” over a civil “class action” if, among other things,\nthe “matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of\n$5,000,000.” 28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2), (5). The statute\nadds that “to determine whether the matter in controversy\nexceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000,” the “claims of\nthe individual class members shall be aggregated.”\n§1332(d)(6).\n  The question presented concerns a class-action plaintiff\nwho stipulates, prior to certification of the class, that he,\nand the class he seeks to represent, will not seek damages\nthat exceed $5 million in total. Does that stipulation\nremove the case from CAFA’s scope? In our view, it does\nnot.\n                            I\n  In April 2011 respondent, Greg Knowles, filed this\nproposed class action in an Arkansas state court against\npetitioner, the Standard Fire Insurance Company.\nKnowles claimed that, when the company had made cer-\n2           STANDARD FIRE INS. CO. v. KNOWLES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntain homeowner’s insurance loss payments, it had un-\nlawfully failed to include a general contractor fee. And\nKnowles sought to certify a class of “hundreds, and pos-\nsibly thousands” of similarly harmed Arkansas policyhold-\ners. App. to Pet. for Cert. 66. In describing the relief\nsought, the complaint says that the “Plaintiff and Class\nstipulate they will seek to recover total aggregate damages\nof less than five million dollars.” Id., at 60. An attached\naffidavit stipulates that Knowles “will not at any time\nduring this case . . . seek damages for the class . . . in\nexcess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate.” Id., at 75.\n   On May 18, 2011, the company, pointing to CAFA’s\njurisdictional provision, removed the case to Federal Dis-\ntrict Court. See 28 U. S. C. §1332(d); §1453. Knowles\nargued for remand on the ground that the District Court\nlacked jurisdiction. He claimed that the “sum or value” of\nthe “amount in controversy” fell beneath the $5 million\nthreshold. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. On the basis of evi-\ndence presented by the company, the District Court found\nthat that the “sum or value” of the “amount in contro-\nversy” would, in the absence of the stipulation, have fallen\njust above the $5 million threshold. Id., at 2, 8. Nonethe-\nless, in light of Knowles’ stipulation, the court concluded\nthat the amount fell beneath the threshold. The court con-\nsequently ordered the case remanded to the state court.\nId., at 15.\n   The company appealed from the remand order, but the\nEighth Circuit declined to hear the appeal. Id., at 1. See\n28 U. S. C. §1453(c)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (providing\ndiscretion to hear an appeal from a remand order). The\ncompany petitioned for a writ of certiorari. And, in light of\ndivergent views in the lower courts, we granted the writ.\nCompare Frederick v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 683\nF. 3d 1242, 1247 (CA10 2012) (a proposed class-action\nrepresentative’s “attempt to limit damages in the com-\nplaint is not dispositive when determining the amount in\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncontroversy”); with Rolwing v. Nestle Holdings, Inc.,\n666 F. 3d 1069, 1072 (CA8 2012) (a precertification “bind-\ning stipulation limiting damages sought to an amount\nnot exceeding $5 million can be used to defeat CAFA\njurisdiction”).\n                              II\n  CAFA provides the federal district courts with “original\njurisdiction” to hear a “class action” if the class has more\nthan 100 members, the parties are minimally diverse, and\nthe “matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of\n$5,000,000.” 28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2), (5)(B). To “deter-\nmine whether the matter in controversy” exceeds that\nsum, “the claims of the individual class members shall\nbe aggregated.” §1332(d)(6). And those “class members”\ninclude “persons (named or unnamed) who fall within the\ndefinition of the proposed or certified class.” §1332(d)\n(1)(D) (emphasis added).\n  As applied here, the statute tells the District Court to\ndetermine whether it has jurisdiction by adding up the\nvalue of the claim of each person who falls within the\ndefinition of Knowles’ proposed class and determine\nwhether the resulting sum exceeds $5 million. If so, there\nis jurisdiction and the court may proceed with the case.\nThe District Court in this case found that resulting sum\nwould have exceeded $5 million but for the stipulation.\nAnd we must decide whether the stipulation makes a\ncritical difference.\n  In our view, it does not. Our reason is a simple one:\nStipulations must be binding. See 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence\n§2588, p. 821 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1981) (defining a “judicial\nadmission or stipulation” as an “express waiver made . . .\nby the party or his attorney conceding for the purposes of\nthe trial the truth of some alleged fact” (emphasis deleted));\nChristian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal., Hast-\nings College of Law v. Martinez, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n4           STANDARD FIRE INS. CO. v. KNOWLES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(slip op., at 10) (describing a stipulation as “ ‘binding and\nconclusive’ ” and “ ‘not subject to subsequent variation’ ”\n(quoting 83 C. J. S., Stipulations §93 (2000))); 9 Wigmore,\nsupra, §2590, at 822 (the “vital feature” of a judicial ad-\nmission is “universally conceded to be its conclusiveness\nupon the party making it”). The stipulation Knowles prof-\nfered to the District Court, however, does not speak for\nthose he purports to represent.\n   That is because a plaintiff who files a proposed class\naction cannot legally bind members of the proposed class\nbefore the class is certified. See Smith v. Bayer Corp., 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 15) (“Neither a proposed\nclass action nor a rejected class action may bind nonpar-\nties”); id., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (“ ‘[A] nonnamed class\nmember is [not] a party to the class-action litigation before\nthe class is certified’ ” (quoting Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536\nU. S. 1, 16, n. 1 (2002) (SCALIA, J., dissenting))); Brief for\nRespondent 12 (conceding that “a damages limitation . . .\ncannot have a binding effect on the merits of absent class\nmembers’ claims unless and until the class is certified”).\n   Because his precertification stipulation does not bind\nanyone but himself, Knowles has not reduced the value\nof the putative class members’ claims. For jurisdictional\npurposes, our inquiry is limited to examining the case “as\nof the time it was filed in state court,” Wisconsin Dept.\nof Corrections v. Schacht, 524 U. S. 381, 390 (1998). At\nthat point, Knowles lacked the authority to concede the\namount-in-controversy issue for the absent class members.\nThe Federal District Court, therefore, wrongly concluded\nthat Knowles’ precertification stipulation could overcome\nits finding that the CAFA jurisdictional threshold had\nbeen met.\n\n  Knowles concedes that “[f]ederal jurisdiction cannot be\nbased on contingent future events.” Brief for Respondent\n20. Yet the two legal principles to which we have just\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreferred—that stipulations must be binding and that a\nnamed plaintiff cannot bind precertification class mem-\nbers—mean that the amount to which Knowles has stipu-\nlated is in effect contingent.\n   If, for example, as Knowles’ complaint asserts, “hun-\ndreds, and possibly thousands” of persons in Arkansas\nhave similar claims, App. to Pet. for Cert. 66, and if each\nof those claims places a significant sum in controversy, the\nstate court might certify the class and permit the case to\nproceed, but only on the condition that the stipulation be\nexcised. Or a court might find that Knowles is an inade-\nquate representative due to the artificial cap he purports\nto impose on the class’ recovery. E.g., Back Doctors Ltd. v.\nMetropolitan Property & Cas. Ins. Co., 637 F. 3d 827, 830–\n831 (CA7 2011) (noting a class representative’s fiduciary\nduty not to “throw away what could be a major component\nof the class’s recovery”). Similarly, another class mem-\nber could intervene with an amended complaint (without\na stipulation), and the District Court might permit the\naction to proceed with a new representative. See 5 A.\nConte & H. Newberg, Class Actions §16:7, p. 154 (4th ed.\n2002) (“[M]embers of a class have a right to intervene if\ntheir interests are not adequately represented by existing\nparties”). Even were these possibilities remote in Knowles’\nown case, there is no reason to think them farfetched in\nother cases where similar stipulations could have more\ndramatic amount-lowering effects.\n   The strongest counterargument, we believe, takes a syl-\nlogistic form: First, this complaint contains a presently\nnonbinding stipulation that the class will seek damages\nthat amount to less than $5 million. Second, if the state\ncourt eventually certifies that class, the stipulation will\nbind those who choose to remain as class members. Third,\nif the state court eventually insists upon modification of\nthe stipulation (thereby permitting class members to\nobtain more than $5 million), it will have in effect created\n6           STANDARD FIRE INS. CO. v. KNOWLES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na new, different case. Fourth, CAFA, however, permits the\nfederal court to consider only the complaint that the plain-\ntiff has filed, i.e., this complaint, not a new, modified (or\namended) complaint that might eventually emerge.\n   Our problem with this argument lies in its conclusion.\nWe do not agree that CAFA forbids the federal court to\nconsider, for purposes of determining the amount in con-\ntroversy, the very real possibility that a nonbinding,\namount-limiting, stipulation may not survive the class\ncertification process. This potential outcome does not re-\nsult in the creation of a new case not now before the\nfederal court. To hold otherwise would, for CAFA jurisdic-\ntional purposes, treat a nonbinding stipulation as if it\nwere binding, exalt form over substance, and run directly\ncounter to CAFA’s primary objective: ensuring “Federal\ncourt consideration of interstate cases of national impor-\ntance.” §2(b)(2), 119 Stat. 5. It would also have the ef-\nfect of allowing the subdivision of a $100 million action\ninto 21 just-below-$5-million state-court actions simply by\nincluding nonbinding stipulations; such an outcome would\nsquarely conflict with the statute’s objective.\n\n  We agree with Knowles that a federal district court\nmight find it simpler to value the amount in controversy\non the basis of a stipulation than to aggregate the value of\nthe individual claims of all who meet the class description.\nWe also agree that, when judges must decide jurisdictional\nmatters, simplicity is a virtue. See Hertz Corp. v. Friend,\n559 U. S. 77, 94 (2010). But to ignore a nonbinding stipu-\nlation does no more than require the federal judge to do\nwhat she must do in cases without a stipulation and what\nthe statute requires, namely “aggregat[e]” the “claims of\nthe individual class members.” 28 U. S. C. §1332(d)(6).\n  Knowles also points out that federal courts permit indi-\nvidual plaintiffs, who are the masters of their complaints,\nto avoid removal to federal court, and to obtain a remand\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto state court, by stipulating to amounts at issue that fall\nbelow the federal jurisdictional requirement. That is so.\nSee St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303\nU. S. 283, 294 (1938) (“If [a plaintiff] does not desire to try\nhis case in the federal court he may resort to the expedi-\nent of suing for less than the jurisdictional amount, and\nthough he would be justly entitled to more, the defendant\ncannot remove”). But the key characteristic about those\nstipulations is that they are legally binding on all plain-\ntiffs. See 14AA C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Fed-\neral Practice and Procedure §3702.1, p. 335 (4th ed. 2011)\n(federal court, as condition for remand, can insist on a\n“binding affidavit or stipulation that the plaintiff will\ncontinue to claim less than the jurisdictional amount” (em-\nphasis added)). That essential feature is missing here, as\nKnowles cannot yet bind the absent class.\n   Knowles argues in the alternative that a stipulation is\nbinding to the extent it limits attorney’s fees so that the\namount in controversy remains below the CAFA thresh-\nold. We do not consider this issue because Knowles’ stipu-\nlation did not provide for that option.\n\n   In sum, the stipulation at issue here can tie Knowles’\nhands, but it does not resolve the amount-in-controversy\nquestion in light of his inability to bind the rest of the\nclass. For this reason, we believe the District Court, when\nfollowing the statute to aggregate the proposed class\nmembers’ claims, should have ignored that stipulation.\nBecause it did not, we vacate the judgment below and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/855517/", "sha1": "c668532649269707e46f10d82a6674398959c5b0", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2013-03-19T07:25:52.808838"}
