Argued December 3, 2012—Decided March 20, 2013*\nThe Clean Water Act (Act) requires that National Pollutant Discharge\n  Elimination System (NPDES) permits be secured before pollutants\n  are discharged from any point source into the navigable waters of the\n  United States. See 33 U. S. C. §§1311(a), 1362(12). One of the Envi-\n  ronmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) implementing regulations, the\n  Silvicultural Rule, specifies which types of logging-related discharges\n  are point sources. 40 CFR §122.27(b)(1). These discharges require\n  NPDES permits unless some other federal statutory provision ex-\n  empts them from coverage. One such statutory provision exempts\n  “discharges composed entirely of stormwater,” 33 U. S. C.\n  §1342(p)(1), unless the discharge is “associated with industrial activ-\n  ity,” §1342(p)(2)(B). Under the EPA’s Industrial Stormwater Rule,\n  the term “associated with industrial activity” covers only discharges\n  “from any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm\n  water and that is directly related to manufacturing, processing or\n  raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.” 40 CFR\n  §122.26(b)(14). Shortly before oral argument in the instant cases, the\n  EPA issued a final version of an amendment to the Industrial\n  Stormwater Rule, clarifying that the NPDES permit requirement ap-\n  plies only to logging operations involving rock crushing, gravel wash-\n  ing, log sorting, and log storage facilities, which are all listed in the\n  Silvicultural Rule.\n     Petitioner Georgia-Pacific West has a contract with Oregon to har-\n——————\n  * Together with No. 11–347, Georgia-Pacific West, Inc., et al. v.\nNorthwest Environmental Defense Center, also on certiorari to the same\ncourt.\n2      DECKER v.

When it rains, water runs off two\n    logging roads used by petitioner into ditches, culverts, and channels\n    that discharge the water into nearby rivers and streams. The dis-\n    charges often contain large amounts of sediment, which evidence\n    shows may be harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms. Re-\n    spondent Northwest Environmental Defense Center (NEDC) filed\n    suit against petitioner and state and local governments and officials,\n    including petitioner Decker, invoking the Act’s citizen-suit provision,\n    33 U. S. C. §1365, and alleging that the defendants had not obtained\n    NPDES permits before discharging stormwater runoff into two Ore-\n    gon rivers. The District Court dismissed the action for failure to\n    state a claim, concluding that NPDES permits were not required be-\n    cause the ditches, culverts, and channels were not point sources of\n    pollution under the Act and the Silvicultural Rule. The Ninth Circuit\n    reversed. It held that the conveyances were point sources under the\n    Silvicultural Rule. It also concluded that the discharges were “asso-\n    ciated with industrial activity” under the Industrial Stormwater\n    Rule, despite the EPA’s contrary conclusion that the regulation ex-\n    cludes the type of stormwater discharges from logging roads at issue.\n    Thus, the court held, the discharges were not exempt from the\n    NPDES permitting scheme.\nHeld:\n    1. A provision of the Act governing challenges to agency actions,\n §1369(b), is not a jurisdictional bar to this suit. That provision is the\n exclusive vehicle for suits seeking to invalidate certain agency deci-\n sions, such as the establishment of effluent standards and the issu-\n ance of permits. It does not bar a district court from entertaining a\n citizen suit under §1365 when the suit is against an alleged violator\n and seeks to enforce an obligation imposed by the Act or its regula-\n tions. The present action falls within the scope of §1365. Pp. 8–9.\n    2. The EPA’s recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule\n does not make the cases moot. A live controversy continues to exist\n regarding whether petitioners may be held liable for unlawful dis-\n charges under the earlier version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule.\n That version governed petitioners’ past discharges, which might be\n the basis for the imposition of penalties even if, in the future, those\n types of discharges will not require a permit. These cases thus re-\n main live and justiciable. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesa-\n peake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 64–65. The fact that the\n District Court might rule that NEDC’s arguments lack merit, or that\n relief is not warranted on the facts of these cases, does not make the\n cases moot. Pp. 9–11.\n    3.

The regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the\n  statutory term “associated with industrial activity,” §1342(p)(2)(B),\n  and the agency has construed the regulation to exempt the discharges\n  at issue here. When an agency interprets its own regulation, the\n  Court, as a general rule, defers to it “unless that interpretation is\n  ‘plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.’ ” Chase Bank\n  USA, N. A. v. McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (quoting Auer v. Robbins, 519\n  U. S. 452, 461). Here, it was reasonable for the EPA to conclude that\n  the conveyances at issue are “directly related” only to the harvesting\n  of raw materials, rather than to “manufacturing, processing, or raw\n  materials storage areas at an industrial plant.”              40 CFR\n  §122.26(b)(14). The regulatory scheme, taken as a whole, leaves open\n  the rational interpretation that the regulation extends only to tradi-\n  tional industrial buildings such as factories and associated sites and\n  other relatively fixed facilities.\n     Another reason to accord Auer deference to the EPA’s interpreta-\n  tion is that there is no indication that the agency’s current view is a\n  change from prior practice or is a post hoc justification adopted in re-\n  sponse to litigation. See Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,\n  567 U. S. ___, ___. Rather, the EPA has been consistent in its view\n  that the types of discharges at issue do not require NPDES permits.\n  Its decision also exists against a background of state regulation with\n  respect to stormwater runoff from logging roads. In exercising the\n  broad discretion the Act gives the EPA in the realm of stormwater\n  runoff, the agency could reasonably have concluded that further fed-\n  eral regulation would be duplicative or counterproductive in light of\n  Oregon’s extensive rules on the subject.

Under the statute and its implementing\nregulations, a permit is required if the discharges are\ndeemed to be “associated with industrial activity.” 33\nU. S. C. §1342(p)(2)(B). The Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA), with the responsibility to enforce the Act,\nhas issued a regulation defining the term “associated with\nindustrial activity” to cover only discharges “from any\nconveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm\nwater and that is directly related to manufacturing, pro-\ncessing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial\n2   DECKER v.

The EPA interprets\nits regulation to exclude the type of stormwater discharges\nfrom logging roads at issue here. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 24–27. For reasons now to be\nexplained, the Court concludes the EPA’s determination is\na reasonable interpretation of its own regulation; and, in\nconsequence, deference is accorded to the interpretation\nunder Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997).\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972 to “restore\nand maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integ-\nrity of the Nation’s waters.” 86 Stat. 816, 33 U. S. C.\n§1251(a). A central provision of the Act is its require-\nment that individuals, corporations, and governments se-\ncure National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System\n(NPDES) permits before discharging pollution from any\npoint source into the navigable waters of the United\nStates. See §§1311(a), 1362(12); EPA v. California ex rel.\nState Water Resources Control Bd., 426 U. S. 200, 205\n(1976). The Act defines “point source” as\n    “any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, in-\n    cluding but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel,\n    tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, roll-\n    ing stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or\n    vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants\n    are or may be discharged. This term does not include\n    agricultural stormwater discharges and return flows\n    from irrigated agriculture.” §1362(14).\n  When the Act took effect, the EPA found it difficult to\nprocess permit applications from countless owners and\noperators of point sources throughout the country. The\nagency issued regulations exempting certain types of\npoint-source discharges from the NPDES permitting\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nscheme, but in 1977 those directives were found invalid.\nThe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\nruled that the statute did not give the EPA “authority to\nexempt categories of point sources from the permit re-\nquirements” of the Act. Natural Resources Defense Coun-\ncil, Inc. v. Costle, 568 F. 2d 1369, 1377. In response the\nEPA issued new regulations to define with more precision\nwhich categories of discharges qualified as point sources in\nthe first place. Among these regulations was the so-called\nSilvicultural Rule. This rule is at issue here. It provides:\n     “Silvicultural point source means any discernible,\n    confined and discrete conveyance related to rock\n    crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, or log storage\n    facilities which are operated in connection with silvi-\n    cultural activities and from which pollutants are dis-\n    charged into waters of the United States. The term\n    does not include non-point source silvicultural activi-\n    ties such as nursery operations, site preparation,\n    reforestation and subsequent cultural treatment,\n    thinning, prescribed burning, pest and fire control,\n    harvesting operations, surface drainage, or road con-\n    struction and maintenance from which there is natu-\n    ral runoff.” 40 CFR §122.27(b)(1).\n  Under the quoted rule, any discharge from a logging-\nrelated source that qualifies as a point source requires an\nNPDES permit unless some other federal statutory provi-\nsion exempts it from that coverage. In one such provision,\n33 U. S. C. §1342(p), Congress has exempted certain dis-\ncharges of stormwater runoff. The statutory exemptions\nwere considered necessary because, from the outset, the\nEPA had encountered recurring difficulties in determining\nhow best to manage discharges of this kind. See, e.g.,\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 966 F. 2d\n1292, 1295–1296 (CA9 1992). In 1987, Congress responded\nto these problems and adopted various stormwater-related\n4    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\namendments to the Act. §405, 101 Stat. 69, 33 U. S. C.\n§1342(p).\n   The 1987 amendments exempt from the NPDES permit-\nting scheme most “discharges composed entirely of storm-\nwater.” §1342(p)(1). The general exemption, however, does\nnot extend to all stormwater discharges. As relevant here,\nCongress directed the EPA to continue to require per-\nmits for stormwater discharges “associated with indus-\ntrial activity.” §1342(p)(2)(B). The statute does not define\nthat term, but the EPA adopted a regulation (hereinafter\nIndustrial Stormwater Rule) in which it defined it as\n    “the discharge from any conveyance that is used for\n    collecting and conveying storm water and that is\n    directly related to manufacturing, processing or raw\n    materials storage areas at an industrial plant. The\n    term does not include discharges from facilities or ac-\n    tivities excluded from the NPDES program under this\n    part 122. For the categories of industries identified\n    in this section, the term includes, but is not limited\n    to, storm water discharges from . . . immediate access\n    roads and rail lines used or traveled by carriers of raw\n    materials, manufactured products, waste material, or\n    by-products used or created by the facility . . . .” 40\n    CFR §122.26(b)(14) (2006).\n   The Industrial Stormwater Rule also specified that, with\none exception not relevant here, “[f ]acilities classified\nas Standard Industrial Classificatio[n] 24” are “considered\nto be engaging in ‘industrial activity’ for purposes of para-\ngraph (b)(14).” Ibid. The Standard Industrial Classifica-\ntions are a system used by federal agencies to categorize\nfirms engaged in different types of business activity. See\nDept. of Labor, Standard Industrial Classifications Manual,\nonline at http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html (as\nvisited Mar. 14, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file).

This includes the “Logging” indus-\ntry, defined as “[e]stablishments primarily engaged in\ncutting timber and in producing . . . primary forest or\nwood raw materials.” Ibid.\n   On November 30, 2012—three days before the instant\ncases were argued in this Court—the EPA issued its final\nversion of an amendment to the Industrial Stormwater\nRule. The amendment was the agency’s response to the\nCourt of Appeals’ ruling now under review. The amended\nversion seeks to clarify the types of facilities within\nStandard Industrial Classification 24 that are deemed to\nbe engaged in industrial activity for purposes of the rule.\nThe amended Industrial Stormwater Rule does not cover\nall facilities within Standard Industrial Classification 24.\nIt limits covered stormwater discharges to\n    “[f ]acilities classified within Standard Industrial Clas-\n    sification 24, Industry Group 241 that are rock crushing,\n    gravel washing, log sorting, or log storage facilities\n    operated in connection with silvicultural activities\n    . . . and Industry Groups 242 through 249.” 77 Fed.\n    Reg. 72974, pt. 122, subpt. B (2012).\nIt should be noted, by way of explanation, that an Indus-\ntry Group is a subcategory of businesses within a Stand-\nard Industrial Classification. Industry Group 241 is\n“Logging,” while Industry Groups 242 through 245 are,\nrespectively, “Sawmills and Planing Mills,” “Millwork,\nVeneer, Plywood, and Structural Wood,” “Wood Contain-\ners,” and “Wood Buildings and Mobile Homes.” Industry\nGroup 249 is “Miscellaneous Wood Products.” Industry\nGroups 246 through 248 are blank categories. Standard\nIndustrial Classifications Manual, supra, Major Group 24.\n   It is fair to say the purpose of the amended regulation is\nto bring within the NPDES permit process only those\nlogging operations that involve the four types of activity\n6    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n(rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log stor-\nage facilities) that are defined as point sources by the\nexplicit terms of the Silvicultural Rule.\n  Up to this stage in the litigation, of course, the cases\nhave been concerned with the Industrial Stormwater Rule\nbefore the amendment adopted on November 30, 2012.\nThe amended regulation will determine whether from this\npoint forward NPDES permits will be required for the\nstormwater discharges at issue. The parties disagree\nabout the significance of the amended rule for purposes of\nthese cases. Before reaching this and other preliminary\npoints, however, it is appropriate to set forth the facts and\nhistory of the cases leading to the proceedings in this\nCourt.\n                             B\n  At issue are discharges of channeled stormwater runoff\nfrom two logging roads in Oregon’s Tillamook State For-\nest, lying in the Pacific Coast Range about 40 miles west\nof Portland. Petitioner Georgia-Pacific West, along with\nother logging and paper-products companies, has a con-\ntract with the State of Oregon to harvest timber from the\nforest. It uses the roads for that purpose. When it rains\n(which it does often in the mountains of northwest Oregon,\naveraging in some areas more than 100 inches per year),\nwater runs off the graded roads into a system of ditches,\nculverts, and channels that discharge the water into\nnearby rivers and streams. The discharges often contain\nlarge amounts of sediment, in the form of dirt and crushed\ngravel from the roads. There is evidence that this runoff\ncan harm fish and other aquatic organisms.\n  In September 2006, respondent Northwest Environmen-\ntal Defense Center (NEDC) filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Oregon. It invoked the\nClean Water Act’s citizen-suit provision, 33 U. S. C. §1365,\nand named as defendants certain firms involved in log-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nging and paper-products operations (including petitioner\nGeorgia-Pacific West), as well as state and local govern-\nments and officials (including the State Forester of Oregon,\nwho is now petitioner Doug Decker). The suit alleged that\nthe defendants caused discharges of channeled stormwater\nrunoff into two waterways—the South Fork Trask River\nand the Little South Fork Kilchis River. The defendants\nhad not obtained NPDES permits, and so, the suit alleged,\nthey had violated the Act.\n  The District Court dismissed the action for failure to\nstate a claim. It concluded that NPDES permits were not\nrequired because the ditches, culverts, and channels were\nnot point sources of pollution under the Act and the Silvi-\ncultural Rule. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit reversed. Northwest Environmental Defense Center v.\nBrown, 640 F. 3d 1063 (2011). It relied upon three princi-\npal propositions. First, it held that the District Court had\nsubject-matter jurisdiction under §1365 notwithstanding\na different provision of the Act, 33 U. S. C. §1369(b)(1),\nlimiting judicial review of EPA regulations. Second, the\nCourt of Appeals held that while the EPA’s Silvicultural\nRule is ambiguous on the question whether the convey-\nances at issue are point sources, those conveyances must\nbe deemed point sources under the rule in order to give\neffect to the Act’s expansive definition of the term. Third,\nthe Court of Appeals held that because the Industrial\nStormwater Rule makes cross-reference to Standard In-\ndustrial Classification 24, the discharges at issue are\n“associated with industrial activity” within the meaning\nof the regulation, despite the EPA’s conclusion to the con-\ntrary. The regulation was held to be unambiguous on this\npoint. The Court of Appeals thus ruled that the dis-\ncharges were from point sources and not exempt from the\nNPDES permitting scheme by the Industrial Stormwater\nRule. It followed that petitioners had been in violation of\nthe Act.\n8     DECKER v.

S. ___ (2012).\n                             II\n  Before proceeding to the merits, it is necessary to con-\nsider two jurisdictional questions.\n                              A\n   Respondent NEDC invoked the jurisdiction of the Dis-\ntrict Court under 33 U. S. C. §1365(a), which “authorize[s]\nprivate enforcement of the provisions of [the Clean Water\nAct]” and its implementing regulations. Department of\nEnergy v. Ohio, 503 U. S. 607, 613, n. 5 (1992). Petition-\ners, however, maintain that this suit is barred by a sepa-\nrate provision of the Act, §1369(b). That statute provides\nfor “judicial review in the United States courts of appeals\nof various particular actions by the [EPA] Administrator,\nincluding establishment of effluent standards and issu-\nance of permits for discharge of pollutants.” Middlesex\nCounty Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers\nAssn., 453 U. S. 1, 13–14 (1981). Where that review is\navailable, it is the exclusive means of challenging actions\ncovered by the statute, §1369(b)(2), and an application for\nreview must be lodged in the court of appeals within 120\ndays of the Administrator’s action, §1369(b)(1).\n   The Court of Appeals was correct to rule that the exclu-\nsive jurisdiction mandate is not applicable in this suit.\nSection 1369(b) extends only to certain suits challenging\nsome agency actions. It does not bar a district court from\nentertaining a citizen suit under §1365 when the suit is\nagainst an alleged violator and seeks to enforce an obliga-\ntion imposed by the Act or its regulations.\n   The present action is within the scope of §1365. It is a\nclaim to enforce what is at least a permissible reading of\nthe Silvicultural Rule. The rule is ambiguous: Its charac-\nterization of silvicultural harvesting operations “from\nwhich there is natural runoff,” 40 CFR §122.27(b)(1), as a\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

See New Oxford American Dictionary\n1167 (3d ed. 2010) (Oxford Dict.) (“natural” means “existing\nin or caused by nature; not made or caused by human-\nkind”). NEDC’s reading would make the channeled dis-\ncharges here point-source pollution under the Act. In its\nview only this interpretation can be squared with the Act’s\nbroad definition of “point source.” 33 U. S. C. §1362(14).\nOn this premise, the instant suit is an effort not to chal-\nlenge the Silvicultural Rule but to enforce it under a\nproper interpretation. It is a basic tenet that “regulations,\nin order to be valid, must be consistent with the statute\nunder which they are promulgated.” United States v.\nLarionoff, 431 U. S. 864, 873 (1977).\n   For jurisdictional purposes, it is unnecessary to deter-\nmine whether NEDC is correct in arguing that only its\nreading of the Silvicultural Rule is permitted under the\nAct. It suffices to note that NEDC urges the Court to\nadopt a “purposeful but permissible reading of the regula-\ntion . . . to bring it into harmony with . . . the statute.”\nEnvironmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp., 549 U. S.\n561, 573 (2007). NEDC does not seek “an implicit declara-\ntion that the . . . regulations were invalid as written.”\nIbid. And, as a result, §1369(b) is not a jurisdictional bar\nto this suit.\n                             B\n  “It is a basic principle of Article III that a justiciable\ncase or controversy must remain extant at all stages of\nreview, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.”\nUnited States v.

NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nthe EPA’s recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater\nRule makes the cases moot. In a supplemental brief filed\nafter oral argument, petitioner Decker, joined by the\nUnited States as amicus curiae, takes the position that the\nrecent amendment makes these cases moot in relevant part.\nSee Supp. Brief for Petitioners in No. 11–338, pp. 4–6;\nSupp. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4–8.\n   That conclusion is incorrect. “A case becomes moot only\nwhen it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual\nrelief whatever to the prevailing party.” Knox v. Service\nEmployees Int’l, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, despite the\nrecent amendment, a live controversy continues to exist\nregarding whether petitioners may be held liable for un-\nlawful discharges under the earlier version of the Indus-\ntrial Stormwater Rule.\n   Respondent NEDC continues to press its claim that\npetitioners’ discharges are unlawful under both the\namended regulation and the earlier version. See Supp.\nBrief for Respondent 3–13. The instant cases provide no\noccasion to interpret the amended regulation. “ ‘[W]e are a\ncourt of review, not of first view.’ ” Arkansas Game and\nFish Comm’n v. United States, ante, at 13 (quoting Cutter\nv. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005)). The parties,\nhowever, have litigated the suit extensively based on the\nearlier version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule; and\nthat version governed petitioners’ past discharges, which\nmight be the basis for the imposition of penalties even if,\nin the future, those types of discharges will not require a\npermit.\n   If the Court of Appeals is correct that petitioners were\nobligated to secure NPDES permits before discharging\nchanneled stormwater runoff, the District Court might\norder some remedy for their past violations. The Act\ncontemplates civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day, 33\nU. S. C. §1319(d), as well as attorney’s fees for prevailing\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

NEDC, in addition, requests injunctive\nrelief for both past and ongoing violations, in part in the\nform of an order that petitioners incur certain environmental-\nremediation costs to alleviate harms attributable to\ntheir past discharges. Under these circumstances, the\ncases remain live and justiciable, for the possibility of\nsome remedy for a proven past violation is real and not\nremote. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake\nBay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 64–65 (1987). The\nDistrict Court, it is true, might rule that NEDC’s argu-\nments lack merit, or that the relief it seeks is not warranted\non the facts of these cases. That possibility, however, does\nnot make the cases moot. “There may be jurisdiction and\nyet an absence of merits.” General Investment Co. v.\nNew York Central R. Co., 271 U. S. 228, 230 (1926).\n                             III\n   The substantive question of the necessity for an NPDES\npermit under the earlier rule now must be addressed.\nUnder the Act, petitioners were required to secure NPDES\npermits for the discharges of channeled stormwater runoff\nonly if the discharges were “associated with industrial\nactivity,” 33 U. S. C. §1342(p)(2)(B), as that statutory term\nis defined in the preamendment version of the Industrial\nStormwater Rule, 40 CFR §122.26(b)(14) (2006). Other-\nwise, the discharges fall within the Act’s general exemp-\ntion of “discharges composed entirely of stormwater” from\nthe NPDES permitting scheme. 33 U. S. C. §1342(p)(1).\n   NEDC first contends that the statutory term “associated\nwith industrial activity” unambiguously covers discharges\nof channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads. See\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U. S. 837, 842–843 (1984). That view, however,\noverlooks the multiple definitions of the terms “indus-\ntrial” and “industry.” These words can refer to business\nactivity in general, yet so too can they be limited to “eco-\n12   DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnomic activity concerned with the processing of raw mate-\nrials and manufacture of goods in factories.” Oxford Dict.\n887. The latter definition does not necessarily encompass\noutdoor timber harvesting. The statute does not foreclose\nmore specific definition by the agency, since it provides no\nfurther detail as to its intended scope.\n   Somewhat more plausible is NEDC’s claim that the\npreamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule\nunambiguously required a permit for the discharges at\nissue. NEDC reasons that under the rule, “[f]or the cate-\ngories of industries identified in this section,” NPDES\npermits are required for, among other things, “storm\nwater discharges from . . . immediate access roads . . . used\nor traveled by carriers of raw materials.”            40 CFR\n§122.26(b)(14) (2006). Yet this raises the question wheth-\ner logging is a “categor[y] of industr[y]” identified by the\nsection. The regulation goes on to identify a list of “cate-\ngories of facilities” that “are considered to be engaging in\n‘industrial activity’ for purposes” of the Industrial Storm-\nwater Rule. Ibid. In the earlier version of the regulation,\nthis list included “[f]acilities classified as Standard Indus-\ntrial Classificatio[n] 24,” which encompasses “Logging.”\nIbid. See also supra, at 4–5. Hence, NEDC asserts, log-\nging is among the categories of industries for which “storm\nwater discharges from . . . immediate access roads . . . used\nor traveled by carriers of raw materials” required NPDES\npermits under the earlier version of the Industrial Storm-\nwater Rule. §122.26(b)(14). NEDC further notes, in sup-\nport of its reading of the regulation, that modern logging is\na large-scale, highly mechanized enterprise, using sophis-\nticated harvesting machines weighing up to 20 tons. See\nBrief for Respondent 4–5.\n   The EPA takes a different view. It concludes that the\nearlier regulation invoked Standard Industrial Classifica-\ntion 24 “ ‘to regulate traditional industrial sources such\nas sawmills.’ ” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n24–25. It points to the regulation’s reference to “facilities”\nand the classification’s reference to “establishments,”\nwhich suggest industrial sites more fixed and permanent\nthan outdoor timber-harvesting operations. Ibid. See also\n55 Fed. Reg. 47990, 48008 (1990). This reading is re-\ninforced by the Industrial Stormwater Rule’s definition\nof discharges associated with industrial activity as dis-\ncharges “from any conveyance that is used for collecting\nand conveying storm water and that is directly related to\nmanufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas\nat an industrial plant.” 40 CFR §122.26(b)(14) (2006).\nThis language lends support to the EPA’s claim that the\nregulation does not cover temporary, outdoor logging\ninstallations. It was reasonable for the agency to conclude\nthat the conveyances at issue are “directly related” only to\nthe harvesting of raw materials, rather than to “manufac-\nturing,” “processing,” or “raw materials storage areas.”\nSee Oxford Dict. 1066 (manufacturing is “mak[ing] (some-\nthing) on a large scale using machinery”); id., at 1392\n(processing is “perform[ing] a series of mechanical or\nchemical operations on (something) in order to change or\npreserve it”). In addition, even if logging as a general\nmatter is a type of economic activity within the regula-\ntion’s scope, a reasonable interpretation of the regulation\ncould still require the discharges to be related in a direct\nway to operations “at an industrial plant” in order to be\nsubject to NPDES permitting.\n   NEDC resists this conclusion, noting that elsewhere in\nthe Industrial Stormwater Rule the EPA has required\nNPDES permits for stormwater discharges associated\nwith other types of outdoor economic activity.            See\n§122.26(b)(14)(iii) (mining); §122.26(b)(14)(v) (landfills\nreceiving industrial waste); §122.26(b)(14)(x) (large con-\nstruction sites). The EPA reasonably could conclude,\nhowever, that these types of activities tend to be more\nfixed and permanent than timber-harvesting operations\n14   DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nare and have a closer connection to traditional industrial\nsites. In light of the language of the regulation just dis-\ncussed, moreover, the inclusion of these types of economic\nactivity in the Industrial Stormwater Rule need not be\nread to mandate that all stormwater discharges related to\nthese activities fall within the rule, just as the inclusion of\nlogging need not be read to extend to all discharges from\nlogging sites. The regulation’s reach may be limited by\nthe requirement that the discharges be “directly related to\nmanufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas\nat an industrial plant.” §122.26(b)(14).\n   It is well established that an agency’s interpretation\nneed not be the only possible reading of a regulation—or\neven the best one—to prevail. When an agency interprets\nits own regulation, the Court, as a general rule, defers to it\n“unless that interpretation is ‘plainly erroneous or incon-\nsistent with the regulation.’ ” Chase Bank USA, N. A. v.\nMcCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting\nAuer, 519 U. S., at 461). The EPA’s interpretation is\na permissible one. Taken together, the regulation’s ref-\nerences to “facilities,” “establishments,” “manufacturing,”\n“processing,” and an “industrial plant” leave open the\nrational interpretation that the regulation extends only to\ntraditional industrial buildings such as factories and\nassociated sites, as well as other relatively fixed facilities.\n   There is another reason to accord Auer deference to the\nEPA’s interpretation: there is no indication that its cur-\nrent view is a change from prior practice or a post hoc\njustification adopted in response to litigation. See Chris-\ntopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) (slip op., at 10). The opposite is the case. The\nagency has been consistent in its view that the types of\ndischarges at issue here do not require NPDES permits.\n   The EPA’s decision exists against a background of state\nregulation with respect to stormwater runoff from logging\nroads. The State of Oregon has made an extensive effort\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto develop a comprehensive set of best practices to manage\nstormwater runoff from logging roads. These practices\ninclude rules mandating filtration of stormwater runoff\nbefore it enters rivers and streams, Ore. Admin. Rule 629–\n625–0330(4) (2012); requiring logging companies to con-\nstruct roads using surfacing that minimizes the sediment\nin runoff, Rule 629–625–0700(2); and obligating firms to\ncease operations where such efforts fail to prevent vis-\nible increases in water turbidity, Rule 629–625–0700(3).\nOregon has invested substantial time and money in estab-\nlishing these practices. In addition, the development,\nsiting, maintenance, and regulation of roads—and in\nparticular of state forest roads—are areas in which Ore-\ngon has considerable expertise. In exercising the broad\ndiscretion the Clean Water Act gives the EPA in the realm\nof stormwater runoff, the agency could reasonably have\nconcluded that further federal regulation in this area\nwould be duplicative or counterproductive. Indeed, Con-\ngress has given express instructions to the EPA to work\n“in consultation with State and local officials” to alleviate\nstormwater pollution by developing the precise kind of\nbest management practices Oregon has established here.\n33 U.

Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410\n(1945); Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997).\n   Two Terms ago, in my separate concurrence in Talk\nAmerica, I expressed doubts about the validity of this\npractice. In that case, however, the agency’s interpreta-\ntion of the rule was also the fairest one, and no party had\nasked us to reconsider Auer. Today, however, the Court’s\ndeference to the agency makes the difference (note the\nCourt’s defensive insistence that the agency’s interpreta-\ntion need not be “the best one,” ante, at 14). And respon-\ndent has asked us, if necessary, to “ ‘reconsider Auer.’ ” I\nbelieve that it is time to do so. See Brief for Respondent\n42, n. 12; see also Brief for Law Professors on the Propri-\nety of Administrative Deference as Amici Curiae. This is\nespecially true because the circumstances of these cases\nillustrate Auer’s flaws in a particularly vivid way.\n   The canonical formulation of Auer deference is that we\nwill enforce an agency’s interpretation of its own rules\nunless that interpretation is “plainly erroneous or incon-\nsistent with the regulation.” Seminole Rock, supra, at 414.\nBut of course whenever the agency’s interpretation of the\nregulation is different from the fairest reading, it is in that\nsense “inconsistent” with the regulation. Obviously, that\nis not enough, or there would be nothing for Auer to do. In\npractice, Auer deference is Chevron deference applied to\nregulations rather than statutes. See Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837 (1984). The agency’s interpretation will be accepted if,\nthough not the fairest reading of the regulation, it is a\nplausible reading—within the scope of the ambiguity that\nthe regulation contains.\n   Our cases have not put forward a persuasive justifica-\ntion for Auer deference. The first case to apply it, Semi-\nnole Rock, offered no justification whatever—just the ipse\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

S., at 414. Our\nlater cases provide two principal explanations, neither of\nwhich has much to be said for it. See generally Stephen-\nson & Pogoriler, Seminole Rock’s Domain, 79 Geo. Wash.\nL. Rev. 1449, 1454–1458 (2011). First, some cases say\nthat the agency, as the drafter of the rule, will have some\nspecial insight into its intent when enacting it. E.g.,\nMartin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review\nComm’n, 499 U. S. 144, 150–153 (1991). The implied\npremise of this argument—that what we are looking for is\nthe agency’s intent in adopting the rule—is false. There is\ntrue of regulations what is true of statutes. As Justice\nHolmes put it: “[w]e do not inquire what the legislature\nmeant; we ask only what the statute means.” The Theory\nof Legal Interpretation, 12 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 419 (1899).\nWhether governing rules are made by the national legisla-\nture or an administrative agency, we are bound by what\nthey say, not by the unexpressed intention of those who\nmade them.\n   The other rationale our cases provide is that the agency\npossesses special expertise in administering its “ ‘complex\nand highly technical regulatory program.’ ” See, e.g.,\nThomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 512\n(1994). That is true enough, and it leads to the conclu-\nsion that agencies and not courts should make regula-\ntions. But it has nothing to do with who should interpret\nregulations—unless one believes that the purpose of inter-\npretation is to make the regulatory program work in a fashion\nthat the current leadership of the agency deems effective.\nMaking regulatory programs effective is the purpose of\nrulemaking, in which the agency uses its “special exper-\ntise” to formulate the best rule. But the purpose of inter-\npretation is to determine the fair meaning of the rule—to\n“say what the law is,” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,\n4    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                              CENTER\n\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J. \n\n\n177 (1803). Not to make policy, but to determine what\npolicy has been made and promulgated by the agency, to\nwhich the public owes obedience. Indeed, since the leader-\nship of agencies (and hence the policy preferences of agen-\ncies) changes with Presidential administrations, an agency\nhead can only be sure that the application of his “special\nexpertise” to the issue addressed by a regulation will be\ngiven effect if we adhere to predictable principles of textual\ninterpretation rather than defer to the “special expertise”\nof his successors. If we take agency enactments as writ-\nten, the Executive has a stable background against which\nto write its rules and achieve the policy ends it thinks\nbest.\n   Another conceivable justification for Auer deference,\nthough not one that is to be found in our cases, is this: If it\nis reasonable to defer to agencies regarding the meaning of\nstatutes that Congress enacted, as we do per Chevron, it is\na fortiori reasonable to defer to them regarding the mean-\ning of regulations that they themselves crafted. To give an\nagency less control over the meaning of its own regula-\ntions than it has over the meaning of a congressionally\nenacted statute seems quite odd.\n   But it is not odd at all. The theory of Chevron (take it or\nleave it) is that when Congress gives an agency authority\nto administer a statute, including authority to issue in-\nterpretive regulations, it implicitly accords the agency a\ndegree of discretion, which the courts must respect, re-\ngarding the meaning of the statute. See Smiley v. Citi-\nbank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 740–741 (1996).\nWhile the implication of an agency power to clarify the\nstatute is reasonable enough, there is surely no congres-\nsional implication that the agency can resolve ambiguities\nin its own regulations. For that would violate a funda-\nmental principle of separation of powers—that the power\nto write a law and the power to interpret it cannot rest\nin the same hands. “When the legislative and executive\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

XI, ch. 6, pp. 151–152 (O. Piest ed., T.\nNugent transl. 1949). Congress cannot enlarge its own\npower through Chevron—whatever it leaves vague in the\nstatute will be worked out by someone else. Chevron rep-\nresents a presumption about who, as between the Execu-\ntive and the Judiciary, that someone else will be. (The\nExecutive, by the way—the competing political branch—is\nthe less congenial repository of the power as far as Con-\ngress is concerned.) So Congress’s incentive is to speak as\nclearly as possible on the matters it regards as important.\n   But when an agency interprets its own rules—that is\nsomething else. Then the power to prescribe is augmented\nby the power to interpret; and the incentive is to speak\nvaguely and broadly, so as to retain a “flexibility” that\nwill enable “clarification” with retroactive effect. “It is per-\nfectly understandable” for an agency to “issue vague regula-\ntions” if doing so will “maximiz[e] agency power.” Thomas\nJefferson Univ., supra, at 525 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\nCombining the power to prescribe with the power to inter-\npret is not a new evil: Blackstone condemned the practice\nof resolving doubts about “the construction of the Roman\nlaws” by “stat[ing] the case to the emperor in writing, and\ntak[ing] his opinion upon it.” 1 W. Blackstone, Commen-\ntaries on the Laws of England 58 (1765). And our Consti-\ntution did not mirror the British practice of using the\nHouse of Lords as a court of last resort, due in part to the\nfear that he who has “agency in passing bad laws” might\noperate in the “same spirit” in their interpretation. The\nFederalist No. 81, pp. 543–544 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Auer\ndeference encourages agencies to be “vague in framing\nregulations, with the plan of issuing ‘interpretations’ to\ncreate the intended new law without observance of notice\n6    DECKER v.

L. J. Am. U. 1, 11–12 (1996). Auer is not a logical\ncorollary to Chevron but a dangerous permission slip for\nthe arrogation of power. See Talk America, 564 U. S., at\n___ (SCALIA, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2–3); Manning,\nConstitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to Agency\nInterpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612\n(1996).\n   It is true enough that Auer deference has the same\nbeneficial pragmatic effect as Chevron deference: The\ncountry need not endure the uncertainty produced by\ndivergent views of numerous district courts and courts of\nappeals as to what is the fairest reading of the regulation,\nuntil a definitive answer is finally provided, years later, by\nthis Court. The agency’s view can be relied upon, unless it\nis, so to speak, beyond the pale. But the duration of the\nuncertainty produced by a vague regulation need not be as\nlong as the uncertainty produced by a vague statute. For\nas soon as an interpretation uncongenial to the agency is\npronounced by a district court, the agency can begin the\nprocess of amending the regulation to make its meaning\nentirely clear. The circumstances of this case demonstrate\nthe point. While these cases were being briefed before us,\nEPA issued a rule designed to respond to the Court of\nAppeals judgment we are reviewing. See 77 Fed. Reg.\n72974 (2012) (to be codified in 40 CFR pt. 122, sub pt. B).\nIt did so (by the standards of such things) relatively\nquickly: The decision below was handed down in May 2011,\nand in December 2012 the EPA published an amended\nrule setting forth in unmistakable terms the position it ar-\ngues here. And there is another respect in which a lack of\nChevron-type deference has less severe pragmatic conse-\nquences for rules than for statutes. In many cases, when\nan agency believes that its rule permits conduct that the\ntext arguably forbids, it can simply exercise its discretion\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

That is not possible, of course, when, as\nhere, a party harmed by the violation has standing to\ncompel enforcement.\n   In any case, however great may be the efficiency gains\nderived from Auer deference, beneficial effect cannot jus-\ntify a rule that not only has no principled basis but contra-\nvenes one of the great rules of separation of powers: He\nwho writes a law must not adjudge its violation.\n                              II\n   I would therefore resolve these cases by using the famil-\niar tools of textual interpretation to decide: Is what the\npetitioners did here proscribed by the fairest reading of\nthe regulations? What they did was to channel storm-\nwater runoff from logging roads without a permit. To\ndecide whether that was permissible we must answer one,\nand possibly two, questions: First, was the stormwater\ndischarged from a “point source”? If not, no permit was\nrequired. But if so, we face the second question: Were the\nstormwater discharges exempt from the permit require-\nment because they were not “associated with industrial\nactivity”? The fairest reading of the statute and regula-\ntions is that these discharges were from point sources, and\nwere associated with industrial activity.\n                              A\n  The Clean Water Act generally prohibits discharging\npollution without a permit from what it calls a “point\nsource.” 33 U. S. C. §1311(a). A “point source” is defined\nas “any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance,\nincluding but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel,\ntunnel, conduit,” and several other things. §1362(14). The\nstormwater here was discharged from logging roads\nthrough a series of pipes, ditches, and channels—all items\nexpressly named in the definition.\n  EPA argues that the Silvicultural Rule, 40 CFR\n8    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                              CENTER\n\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J. \n\n\n§122.27(b)(1) (2006), excludes from the definition of\n“[s]ilvicultural point source” “harvesting operations . . .\nfrom which there is natural runoff.” This is relevant, says\nthe agency, because that rule specifies that only\n“[s]ilvicultural point sources, as defined in this section,”\nare “point sources subject to the . . . permit program.”\n§122.27(a). In EPA’s view, the stormwater here is “natu-\nral runoff.”\n   But are stormwater discharges “natural runoff ” when\nthey are channeled through manmade pipes and ditches,\nand carry with them manmade pollutants from manmade\nforest roads? It is not obvious that this is so—as the agency\nagrees. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19\n(the rule’s “reference to ‘natural runoff ’ associated with\nlogging roads neither clearly encompasses nor clearly\nexcludes the sort of channeled runoff that is at issue in\nthis case”). In my view, giving the term the agency’s\ninterpretation would contradict the statute’s definition of\n“point source,” which explicitly includes any “pipe, ditch,\nchannel, tunnel, [and] conduit.” Applying the interpretive\npresumption of validity—the canon that we are to “prefe[r]\nthe meaning that preserves to the meaning that destroys,”\nPanama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388, 439 (1935)\n(Cardozo, J., dissenting)—I would hold that the regula-\ntion’s exclusion of “natural runoff ” does not reach the\nsituation here. The stormwater discharges came from point\nsources, because they flowed out of artificial “pipe[s],”\n“ditch[es],” and “channel[s],” 33 U. S. C. §1362(14), and\nwere thus not “natural runoff ” from a logging opera-\ntion, 40 CFR §122.27(b)(1) (emphasis added).\n                           B\n  Many point-source stormwater discharges are nonethe-\nless exempt from the usual permitting requirement. See\n33 U. S. C. §1342(p). This exemption, however, does not\nreach discharges “associated with industrial activity.”\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)               9\n\n         SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                         Opinion part and J.\n\nIbid. EPA has enacted a rule defining what it means for\nstormwater discharges to be “associated with” industrial\nactivity, and what activities count as “industrial.” 40 CFR\n§122.26(b)(14).\n   The regulation sets out eleven “categories of industries”;\nas to those industries, discharges are “associated with\nindustrial activity” if they come from sites used for “trans-\nportation” of “any raw material.” Ibid. The forest roads at\nissue here are used to transport raw material (logs); the\nonly question is whether logging is a “categor[y] of in-\ndustr[y]” enumerated in the definition. It is: The second of\nthe listed “categories of facilities” is “[f]acilities classified\nas Standard Industrial Classifications 24 (except 2434).”\n§122.26(b)(14)(ii). Opening one’s hymnal to Standard\nIndustrial Classification 24 (“Lumber and Wood Products,\nExcept Furniture”), one finds that the first industry group\nlisted, No. 2411, is “Logging”—defined as “[e]stablish-\nments primarily engaged in cutting timber.” 2 App. 64.\n(As if that were not clear enough, an illustrative product of\nthis industry is helpfully listed: “Logs.”) That, I would\nthink, is that.\n   EPA disagrees, and the Court gives the agency’s posi-\ntion Auer deference, but that reading is certainly not the\nmost natural one. The Court relies heavily on the fact\nthat the definition of “[s]torm water discharge associ-\nated with industrial activity” requires that the discharge\nbe “directly related to manufacturing, processing or\nraw materials storage areas at an industrial plant,”\n§122.26(b)(14). The crucial question this definition pre-\nsents is whether the concluding phrase “at an industrial\nplant” limits only the last noun phrase (“raw materials\nstorage areas”) or also the two preceding nouns (“manufac-\nturing” and “processing”). The canon of interpretation\nknown as the rule of the last antecedent states that “a\nlimiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as\nmodifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately\n10   DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                              CENTER\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J.\n\nfollows.” Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U. S. 20, 26 (2003). If\na statute provides that “it shall be unlawful to possess a\ngrenade launcher, a fully-automatic weapon, or a shotgun\nwith a barrel shorter than 12 inches,” that does not mean\nthat a grenade launcher with a barrel longer than 12\ninches is legal. Application of the canon would mean that\n“at an industrial plant” modifies only “raw materials\nstorage areas,” and therefore that “manufacturing” and\n“processing” anywhere, including in the forest, would be\n“associated with industrial activity.” (Standard Industrial\nClassification 24 categorizes logging as a manufacturing\nbusiness, and these discharges are therefore “directly\nrelated to manufacturing.”)\n   Like all canons of interpretation, the rule of the last\nantecedent can be overcome by textual indication of\ncontrary meaning. But that does not exist here. To the\ncontrary, the enumerated categories of industries to\nwhich the term “industrial activity” applies reinforce the\nproposition that “at an industrial plant” does not\nmodify “manufacturing” or “processing.” The term in-\ncludes (in addition to logging) “active or inactive mining\noperations,” §122.26(b)(14)(iii); “[l]andfills” and “open\ndumps,” §122.26(b)(14)(v); “automobile junkyards,”\n§122.26(b)(14)(vi); and “[c]onstruction activity including\nclearing, grading and excavation,” §122.26(b)(14)(x).\nThose industries and activities (while related to manufac-\nturing and processing) virtually never take place at any-\nthing like what one might describe as a “plant.” The rule\nof the last antecedent is therefore confirmed as the correct\nguide to meaning here: “at an industrial plant” limits only\n“raw materials storage areas.”\n   EPA also insists, Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 24, that the regulation reaches only “ ‘traditional’ ”\nsources of industrial stormwater, such as sawmills. But\nStandard Industrial Classification 24 has a specific sub-\ncategory (No. 242) that is “Sawmills and Planing Mills.” 2\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

The rule is not so limited, reaching by its terms\n“Standard Industrial Classificatio[n] 24 (except 2434).”\n§122.26(b)(14)(ii). The explicit carving-out of No. 2434 is\ntelling: Why EPA chose to exclude “establishments pri-\nmarily engaged in manufacturing wood kitchen cabinet\nand wood bathroom vanities” from the definition of indus-\ntrial stormwater, I do not know—but the picayune nature\nof the exclusion gives lie to the idea that the rule’s scope\nought to be decided by a rough sense of its gestalt. If EPA\nhad meant to reach only sawmills, it quite obviously knew\nhow to do so.\n   Finally, the Court believes that Standard Industrial\nClassification 24’s reference to “establishments” “sug-\ngest[s] industrial sites more fixed and permanent than\noutdoor timber-harvesting operations.” Ante, at 13. Not\nso. The Standard Industrial Classification uses “es-\ntablishments” throughout to refer to business entities\nin general; for example, Classification 2411 refers to\n“[e]stablishments primarily engaged in cutting timber,”\nwhich includes “producing wood chips in the field.” 2 App.\n64. I cannot imagine what kind of “fixed and permanent”\nindustrial site the Court and EPA imagine will be “produc-\ning wood chips in the field.” And the Court’s final point,\nante, at 13—that the regulatory definition of “industrial\nactivity” uses the word “facilities”—cuts the other way:\nEPA regulations define “facility” to include “any . . . ‘point\nsource.’ ” 40 CFR §122.2; see, e.g., §122.26(b)(14)(iii) (re-\nferring to mines as “facilities”).\n   The agency also assures us that its intent (Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 25) was to reach a more\nlimited subset of logging activities, an intent that it be-\nlieves can essentially float free from the text of the rele-\nvant rule. In the end, this is the real meat of the matter:\nEPA states that it simply did not mean to require permits\nfor the discharges at issue here. And the Court is willing\nto credit that intent, even given what I think has been\n12   DECKER v.

Argued December 3, 2012—Decided March 20, 2013*\nThe Clean Water Act (Act) requires that National Pollutant Discharge\n  Elimination System (NPDES) permits be secured before pollutants\n  are discharged from any point source into the navigable waters of the\n  United States. See 33 U. S. C. §§1311(a), 1362(12). One of the Envi-\n  ronmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) implementing regulations, the\n  Silvicultural Rule, specifies which types of logging-related discharges\n  are point sources. 40 CFR §122.27(b)(1). These discharges require\n  NPDES permits unless some other federal statutory provision ex-\n  empts them from coverage. One such statutory provision exempts\n  “discharges composed entirely of stormwater,” 33 U. S. C.\n  §1342(p)(1), unless the discharge is “associated with industrial activ-\n  ity,” §1342(p)(2)(B). Under the EPA’s Industrial Stormwater Rule,\n  the term “associated with industrial activity” covers only discharges\n  “from any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm\n  water and that is directly related to manufacturing, processing or\n  raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.” 40 CFR\n  §122.26(b)(14). Shortly before oral argument in the instant cases, the\n  EPA issued a final version of an amendment to the Industrial\n  Stormwater Rule, clarifying that the NPDES permit requirement ap-\n  plies only to logging operations involving rock crushing, gravel wash-\n  ing, log sorting, and log storage facilities, which are all listed in the\n  Silvicultural Rule.\n     Petitioner Georgia-Pacific West has a contract with Oregon to har-\n——————\n  * Together with No. 11–347, Georgia-Pacific West, Inc., et al. v.\nNorthwest Environmental Defense Center, also on certiorari to the same\ncourt.\n2      DECKER v.

When it rains, water runs off two\n    logging roads used by petitioner into ditches, culverts, and channels\n    that discharge the water into nearby rivers and streams. The dis-\n    charges often contain large amounts of sediment, which evidence\n    shows may be harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms. Re-\n    spondent Northwest Environmental Defense Center (NEDC) filed\n    suit against petitioner and state and local governments and officials,\n    including petitioner Decker, invoking the Act’s citizen-suit provision,\n    33 U. S. C. §1365, and alleging that the defendants had not obtained\n    NPDES permits before discharging stormwater runoff into two Ore-\n    gon rivers. The District Court dismissed the action for failure to\n    state a claim, concluding that NPDES permits were not required be-\n    cause the ditches, culverts, and channels were not point sources of\n    pollution under the Act and the Silvicultural Rule. The Ninth Circuit\n    reversed. It held that the conveyances were point sources under the\n    Silvicultural Rule. It also concluded that the discharges were “asso-\n    ciated with industrial activity” under the Industrial Stormwater\n    Rule, despite the EPA’s contrary conclusion that the regulation ex-\n    cludes the type of stormwater discharges from logging roads at issue.\n    Thus, the court held, the discharges were not exempt from the\n    NPDES permitting scheme.\nHeld:\n    1. A provision of the Act governing challenges to agency actions,\n §1369(b), is not a jurisdictional bar to this suit. That provision is the\n exclusive vehicle for suits seeking to invalidate certain agency deci-\n sions, such as the establishment of effluent standards and the issu-\n ance of permits. It does not bar a district court from entertaining a\n citizen suit under §1365 when the suit is against an alleged violator\n and seeks to enforce an obligation imposed by the Act or its regula-\n tions. The present action falls within the scope of §1365. Pp. 8–9.\n    2. The EPA’s recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule\n does not make the cases moot. A live controversy continues to exist\n regarding whether petitioners may be held liable for unlawful dis-\n charges under the earlier version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule.\n That version governed petitioners’ past discharges, which might be\n the basis for the imposition of penalties even if, in the future, those\n types of discharges will not require a permit. These cases thus re-\n main live and justiciable. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesa-\n peake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 64–65. The fact that the\n District Court might rule that NEDC’s arguments lack merit, or that\n relief is not warranted on the facts of these cases, does not make the\n cases moot. Pp. 9–11.\n    3.

The regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the\n  statutory term “associated with industrial activity,” §1342(p)(2)(B),\n  and the agency has construed the regulation to exempt the discharges\n  at issue here. When an agency interprets its own regulation, the\n  Court, as a general rule, defers to it “unless that interpretation is\n  ‘plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.’ ” Chase Bank\n  USA, N. A. v. McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (quoting Auer v. Robbins, 519\n  U. S. 452, 461). Here, it was reasonable for the EPA to conclude that\n  the conveyances at issue are “directly related” only to the harvesting\n  of raw materials, rather than to “manufacturing, processing, or raw\n  materials storage areas at an industrial plant.”              40 CFR\n  §122.26(b)(14). The regulatory scheme, taken as a whole, leaves open\n  the rational interpretation that the regulation extends only to tradi-\n  tional industrial buildings such as factories and associated sites and\n  other relatively fixed facilities.\n     Another reason to accord Auer deference to the EPA’s interpreta-\n  tion is that there is no indication that the agency’s current view is a\n  change from prior practice or is a post hoc justification adopted in re-\n  sponse to litigation. See Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,\n  567 U. S. ___, ___. Rather, the EPA has been consistent in its view\n  that the types of discharges at issue do not require NPDES permits.\n  Its decision also exists against a background of state regulation with\n  respect to stormwater runoff from logging roads. In exercising the\n  broad discretion the Act gives the EPA in the realm of stormwater\n  runoff, the agency could reasonably have concluded that further fed-\n  eral regulation would be duplicative or counterproductive in light of\n  Oregon’s extensive rules on the subject.

Under the statute and its implementing\nregulations, a permit is required if the discharges are\ndeemed to be “associated with industrial activity.” 33\nU. S. C. §1342(p)(2)(B). The Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA), with the responsibility to enforce the Act,\nhas issued a regulation defining the term “associated with\nindustrial activity” to cover only discharges “from any\nconveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm\nwater and that is directly related to manufacturing, pro-\ncessing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial\n2   DECKER v.

The EPA interprets\nits regulation to exclude the type of stormwater discharges\nfrom logging roads at issue here. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 24–27. For reasons now to be\nexplained, the Court concludes the EPA’s determination is\na reasonable interpretation of its own regulation; and, in\nconsequence, deference is accorded to the interpretation\nunder Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997).\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972 to “restore\nand maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integ-\nrity of the Nation’s waters.” 86 Stat. 816, 33 U. S. C.\n§1251(a). A central provision of the Act is its require-\nment that individuals, corporations, and governments se-\ncure National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System\n(NPDES) permits before discharging pollution from any\npoint source into the navigable waters of the United\nStates. See §§1311(a), 1362(12); EPA v. California ex rel.\nState Water Resources Control Bd., 426 U. S. 200, 205\n(1976). The Act defines “point source” as\n    “any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, in-\n    cluding but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel,\n    tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, roll-\n    ing stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or\n    vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants\n    are or may be discharged. This term does not include\n    agricultural stormwater discharges and return flows\n    from irrigated agriculture.” §1362(14).\n  When the Act took effect, the EPA found it difficult to\nprocess permit applications from countless owners and\noperators of point sources throughout the country. The\nagency issued regulations exempting certain types of\npoint-source discharges from the NPDES permitting\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nscheme, but in 1977 those directives were found invalid.\nThe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\nruled that the statute did not give the EPA “authority to\nexempt categories of point sources from the permit re-\nquirements” of the Act. Natural Resources Defense Coun-\ncil, Inc. v. Costle, 568 F. 2d 1369, 1377. In response the\nEPA issued new regulations to define with more precision\nwhich categories of discharges qualified as point sources in\nthe first place. Among these regulations was the so-called\nSilvicultural Rule. This rule is at issue here. It provides:\n     “Silvicultural point source means any discernible,\n    confined and discrete conveyance related to rock\n    crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, or log storage\n    facilities which are operated in connection with silvi-\n    cultural activities and from which pollutants are dis-\n    charged into waters of the United States. The term\n    does not include non-point source silvicultural activi-\n    ties such as nursery operations, site preparation,\n    reforestation and subsequent cultural treatment,\n    thinning, prescribed burning, pest and fire control,\n    harvesting operations, surface drainage, or road con-\n    struction and maintenance from which there is natu-\n    ral runoff.” 40 CFR §122.27(b)(1).\n  Under the quoted rule, any discharge from a logging-\nrelated source that qualifies as a point source requires an\nNPDES permit unless some other federal statutory provi-\nsion exempts it from that coverage. In one such provision,\n33 U. S. C. §1342(p), Congress has exempted certain dis-\ncharges of stormwater runoff. The statutory exemptions\nwere considered necessary because, from the outset, the\nEPA had encountered recurring difficulties in determining\nhow best to manage discharges of this kind. See, e.g.,\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 966 F. 2d\n1292, 1295–1296 (CA9 1992). In 1987, Congress responded\nto these problems and adopted various stormwater-related\n4    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\namendments to the Act. §405, 101 Stat. 69, 33 U. S. C.\n§1342(p).\n   The 1987 amendments exempt from the NPDES permit-\nting scheme most “discharges composed entirely of storm-\nwater.” §1342(p)(1). The general exemption, however, does\nnot extend to all stormwater discharges. As relevant here,\nCongress directed the EPA to continue to require per-\nmits for stormwater discharges “associated with indus-\ntrial activity.” §1342(p)(2)(B). The statute does not define\nthat term, but the EPA adopted a regulation (hereinafter\nIndustrial Stormwater Rule) in which it defined it as\n    “the discharge from any conveyance that is used for\n    collecting and conveying storm water and that is\n    directly related to manufacturing, processing or raw\n    materials storage areas at an industrial plant. The\n    term does not include discharges from facilities or ac-\n    tivities excluded from the NPDES program under this\n    part 122. For the categories of industries identified\n    in this section, the term includes, but is not limited\n    to, storm water discharges from . . . immediate access\n    roads and rail lines used or traveled by carriers of raw\n    materials, manufactured products, waste material, or\n    by-products used or created by the facility . . . .” 40\n    CFR §122.26(b)(14) (2006).\n   The Industrial Stormwater Rule also specified that, with\none exception not relevant here, “[f ]acilities classified\nas Standard Industrial Classificatio[n] 24” are “considered\nto be engaging in ‘industrial activity’ for purposes of para-\ngraph (b)(14).” Ibid. The Standard Industrial Classifica-\ntions are a system used by federal agencies to categorize\nfirms engaged in different types of business activity. See\nDept. of Labor, Standard Industrial Classifications Manual,\nonline at http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html (as\nvisited Mar. 14, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file).

This includes the “Logging” indus-\ntry, defined as “[e]stablishments primarily engaged in\ncutting timber and in producing . . . primary forest or\nwood raw materials.” Ibid.\n   On November 30, 2012—three days before the instant\ncases were argued in this Court—the EPA issued its final\nversion of an amendment to the Industrial Stormwater\nRule. The amendment was the agency’s response to the\nCourt of Appeals’ ruling now under review. The amended\nversion seeks to clarify the types of facilities within\nStandard Industrial Classification 24 that are deemed to\nbe engaged in industrial activity for purposes of the rule.\nThe amended Industrial Stormwater Rule does not cover\nall facilities within Standard Industrial Classification 24.\nIt limits covered stormwater discharges to\n    “[f ]acilities classified within Standard Industrial Clas-\n    sification 24, Industry Group 241 that are rock crushing,\n    gravel washing, log sorting, or log storage facilities\n    operated in connection with silvicultural activities\n    . . . and Industry Groups 242 through 249.” 77 Fed.\n    Reg. 72974, pt. 122, subpt. B (2012).\nIt should be noted, by way of explanation, that an Indus-\ntry Group is a subcategory of businesses within a Stand-\nard Industrial Classification. Industry Group 241 is\n“Logging,” while Industry Groups 242 through 245 are,\nrespectively, “Sawmills and Planing Mills,” “Millwork,\nVeneer, Plywood, and Structural Wood,” “Wood Contain-\ners,” and “Wood Buildings and Mobile Homes.” Industry\nGroup 249 is “Miscellaneous Wood Products.” Industry\nGroups 246 through 248 are blank categories. Standard\nIndustrial Classifications Manual, supra, Major Group 24.\n   It is fair to say the purpose of the amended regulation is\nto bring within the NPDES permit process only those\nlogging operations that involve the four types of activity\n6    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n(rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log stor-\nage facilities) that are defined as point sources by the\nexplicit terms of the Silvicultural Rule.\n  Up to this stage in the litigation, of course, the cases\nhave been concerned with the Industrial Stormwater Rule\nbefore the amendment adopted on November 30, 2012.\nThe amended regulation will determine whether from this\npoint forward NPDES permits will be required for the\nstormwater discharges at issue. The parties disagree\nabout the significance of the amended rule for purposes of\nthese cases. Before reaching this and other preliminary\npoints, however, it is appropriate to set forth the facts and\nhistory of the cases leading to the proceedings in this\nCourt.\n                             B\n  At issue are discharges of channeled stormwater runoff\nfrom two logging roads in Oregon’s Tillamook State For-\nest, lying in the Pacific Coast Range about 40 miles west\nof Portland. Petitioner Georgia-Pacific West, along with\nother logging and paper-products companies, has a con-\ntract with the State of Oregon to harvest timber from the\nforest. It uses the roads for that purpose. When it rains\n(which it does often in the mountains of northwest Oregon,\naveraging in some areas more than 100 inches per year),\nwater runs off the graded roads into a system of ditches,\nculverts, and channels that discharge the water into\nnearby rivers and streams. The discharges often contain\nlarge amounts of sediment, in the form of dirt and crushed\ngravel from the roads. There is evidence that this runoff\ncan harm fish and other aquatic organisms.\n  In September 2006, respondent Northwest Environmen-\ntal Defense Center (NEDC) filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Oregon. It invoked the\nClean Water Act’s citizen-suit provision, 33 U. S. C. §1365,\nand named as defendants certain firms involved in log-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nging and paper-products operations (including petitioner\nGeorgia-Pacific West), as well as state and local govern-\nments and officials (including the State Forester of Oregon,\nwho is now petitioner Doug Decker). The suit alleged that\nthe defendants caused discharges of channeled stormwater\nrunoff into two waterways—the South Fork Trask River\nand the Little South Fork Kilchis River. The defendants\nhad not obtained NPDES permits, and so, the suit alleged,\nthey had violated the Act.\n  The District Court dismissed the action for failure to\nstate a claim. It concluded that NPDES permits were not\nrequired because the ditches, culverts, and channels were\nnot point sources of pollution under the Act and the Silvi-\ncultural Rule. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit reversed. Northwest Environmental Defense Center v.\nBrown, 640 F. 3d 1063 (2011). It relied upon three princi-\npal propositions. First, it held that the District Court had\nsubject-matter jurisdiction under §1365 notwithstanding\na different provision of the Act, 33 U. S. C. §1369(b)(1),\nlimiting judicial review of EPA regulations. Second, the\nCourt of Appeals held that while the EPA’s Silvicultural\nRule is ambiguous on the question whether the convey-\nances at issue are point sources, those conveyances must\nbe deemed point sources under the rule in order to give\neffect to the Act’s expansive definition of the term. Third,\nthe Court of Appeals held that because the Industrial\nStormwater Rule makes cross-reference to Standard In-\ndustrial Classification 24, the discharges at issue are\n“associated with industrial activity” within the meaning\nof the regulation, despite the EPA’s conclusion to the con-\ntrary. The regulation was held to be unambiguous on this\npoint. The Court of Appeals thus ruled that the dis-\ncharges were from point sources and not exempt from the\nNPDES permitting scheme by the Industrial Stormwater\nRule. It followed that petitioners had been in violation of\nthe Act.\n8     DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n\n                         CENTER\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n    This Court granted certiorari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                             II\n  Before proceeding to the merits, it is necessary to con-\nsider two jurisdictional questions.\n                              A\n   Respondent NEDC invoked the jurisdiction of the Dis-\ntrict Court under 33 U. S. C. §1365(a), which “authorize[s]\nprivate enforcement of the provisions of [the Clean Water\nAct]” and its implementing regulations. Department of\nEnergy v. Ohio, 503 U. S. 607, 613, n. 5 (1992). Petition-\ners, however, maintain that this suit is barred by a sepa-\nrate provision of the Act, §1369(b). That statute provides\nfor “judicial review in the United States courts of appeals\nof various particular actions by the [EPA] Administrator,\nincluding establishment of effluent standards and issu-\nance of permits for discharge of pollutants.” Middlesex\nCounty Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers\nAssn., 453 U. S. 1, 13–14 (1981). Where that review is\navailable, it is the exclusive means of challenging actions\ncovered by the statute, §1369(b)(2), and an application for\nreview must be lodged in the court of appeals within 120\ndays of the Administrator’s action, §1369(b)(1).\n   The Court of Appeals was correct to rule that the exclu-\nsive jurisdiction mandate is not applicable in this suit.\nSection 1369(b) extends only to certain suits challenging\nsome agency actions. It does not bar a district court from\nentertaining a citizen suit under §1365 when the suit is\nagainst an alleged violator and seeks to enforce an obliga-\ntion imposed by the Act or its regulations.\n   The present action is within the scope of §1365. It is a\nclaim to enforce what is at least a permissible reading of\nthe Silvicultural Rule. The rule is ambiguous: Its charac-\nterization of silvicultural harvesting operations “from\nwhich there is natural runoff,” 40 CFR §122.27(b)(1), as a\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnonpoint source might be read, as petitioners contend, to\napply to the channeled stormwater runoff at issue; or it\nmight be read, as respondent NEDC urges, to apply only\nto runoff not collected in channels or other engineered\nimprovements. See New Oxford American Dictionary\n1167 (3d ed. 2010) (Oxford Dict.) (“natural” means “existing\nin or caused by nature; not made or caused by human-\nkind”). NEDC’s reading would make the channeled dis-\ncharges here point-source pollution under the Act. In its\nview only this interpretation can be squared with the Act’s\nbroad definition of “point source.” 33 U. S. C. §1362(14).\nOn this premise, the instant suit is an effort not to chal-\nlenge the Silvicultural Rule but to enforce it under a\nproper interpretation. It is a basic tenet that “regulations,\nin order to be valid, must be consistent with the statute\nunder which they are promulgated.” United States v.\nLarionoff, 431 U. S. 864, 873 (1977).\n   For jurisdictional purposes, it is unnecessary to deter-\nmine whether NEDC is correct in arguing that only its\nreading of the Silvicultural Rule is permitted under the\nAct. It suffices to note that NEDC urges the Court to\nadopt a “purposeful but permissible reading of the regula-\ntion . . . to bring it into harmony with . . . the statute.”\nEnvironmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp., 549 U. S.\n561, 573 (2007). NEDC does not seek “an implicit declara-\ntion that the . . . regulations were invalid as written.”\nIbid. And, as a result, §1369(b) is not a jurisdictional bar\nto this suit.\n                             B\n  “It is a basic principle of Article III that a justiciable\ncase or controversy must remain extant at all stages of\nreview, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.”\nUnited States v. Juvenile Male, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This principle requires us to determine whether\n10   DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nthe EPA’s recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater\nRule makes the cases moot. In a supplemental brief filed\nafter oral argument, petitioner Decker, joined by the\nUnited States as amicus curiae, takes the position that the\nrecent amendment makes these cases moot in relevant part.\nSee Supp. Brief for Petitioners in No. 11–338, pp. 4–6;\nSupp. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4–8.\n   That conclusion is incorrect. “A case becomes moot only\nwhen it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual\nrelief whatever to the prevailing party.” Knox v. Service\nEmployees Int’l, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, despite the\nrecent amendment, a live controversy continues to exist\nregarding whether petitioners may be held liable for un-\nlawful discharges under the earlier version of the Indus-\ntrial Stormwater Rule.\n   Respondent NEDC continues to press its claim that\npetitioners’ discharges are unlawful under both the\namended regulation and the earlier version. See Supp.\nBrief for Respondent 3–13. The instant cases provide no\noccasion to interpret the amended regulation. “ ‘[W]e are a\ncourt of review, not of first view.’ ” Arkansas Game and\nFish Comm’n v. United States, ante, at 13 (quoting Cutter\nv. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005)). The parties,\nhowever, have litigated the suit extensively based on the\nearlier version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule; and\nthat version governed petitioners’ past discharges, which\nmight be the basis for the imposition of penalties even if,\nin the future, those types of discharges will not require a\npermit.\n   If the Court of Appeals is correct that petitioners were\nobligated to secure NPDES permits before discharging\nchanneled stormwater runoff, the District Court might\norder some remedy for their past violations. The Act\ncontemplates civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day, 33\nU. S. C. §1319(d), as well as attorney’s fees for prevailing\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nparties, §1365(d). NEDC, in addition, requests injunctive\nrelief for both past and ongoing violations, in part in the\nform of an order that petitioners incur certain environmental-\nremediation costs to alleviate harms attributable to\ntheir past discharges. Under these circumstances, the\ncases remain live and justiciable, for the possibility of\nsome remedy for a proven past violation is real and not\nremote. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake\nBay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 64–65 (1987). The\nDistrict Court, it is true, might rule that NEDC’s argu-\nments lack merit, or that the relief it seeks is not warranted\non the facts of these cases. That possibility, however, does\nnot make the cases moot. “There may be jurisdiction and\nyet an absence of merits.” General Investment Co. v.\nNew York Central R. Co., 271 U. S. 228, 230 (1926).\n                             III\n   The substantive question of the necessity for an NPDES\npermit under the earlier rule now must be addressed.\nUnder the Act, petitioners were required to secure NPDES\npermits for the discharges of channeled stormwater runoff\nonly if the discharges were “associated with industrial\nactivity,” 33 U. S. C. §1342(p)(2)(B), as that statutory term\nis defined in the preamendment version of the Industrial\nStormwater Rule, 40 CFR §122.26(b)(14) (2006). Other-\nwise, the discharges fall within the Act’s general exemp-\ntion of “discharges composed entirely of stormwater” from\nthe NPDES permitting scheme. 33 U. S. C. §1342(p)(1).\n   NEDC first contends that the statutory term “associated\nwith industrial activity” unambiguously covers discharges\nof channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads. See\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U. S. 837, 842–843 (1984). That view, however,\noverlooks the multiple definitions of the terms “indus-\ntrial” and “industry.” These words can refer to business\nactivity in general, yet so too can they be limited to “eco-\n12   DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnomic activity concerned with the processing of raw mate-\nrials and manufacture of goods in factories.” Oxford Dict.\n887. The latter definition does not necessarily encompass\noutdoor timber harvesting. The statute does not foreclose\nmore specific definition by the agency, since it provides no\nfurther detail as to its intended scope.\n   Somewhat more plausible is NEDC’s claim that the\npreamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule\nunambiguously required a permit for the discharges at\nissue. NEDC reasons that under the rule, “[f]or the cate-\ngories of industries identified in this section,” NPDES\npermits are required for, among other things, “storm\nwater discharges from . . . immediate access roads . . . used\nor traveled by carriers of raw materials.”            40 CFR\n§122.26(b)(14) (2006). Yet this raises the question wheth-\ner logging is a “categor[y] of industr[y]” identified by the\nsection. The regulation goes on to identify a list of “cate-\ngories of facilities” that “are considered to be engaging in\n‘industrial activity’ for purposes” of the Industrial Storm-\nwater Rule. Ibid. In the earlier version of the regulation,\nthis list included “[f]acilities classified as Standard Indus-\ntrial Classificatio[n] 24,” which encompasses “Logging.”\nIbid. See also supra, at 4–5. Hence, NEDC asserts, log-\nging is among the categories of industries for which “storm\nwater discharges from . . . immediate access roads . . . used\nor traveled by carriers of raw materials” required NPDES\npermits under the earlier version of the Industrial Storm-\nwater Rule. §122.26(b)(14). NEDC further notes, in sup-\nport of its reading of the regulation, that modern logging is\na large-scale, highly mechanized enterprise, using sophis-\nticated harvesting machines weighing up to 20 tons. See\nBrief for Respondent 4–5.\n   The EPA takes a different view. It concludes that the\nearlier regulation invoked Standard Industrial Classifica-\ntion 24 “ ‘to regulate traditional industrial sources such\nas sawmills.’ ” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n24–25. It points to the regulation’s reference to “facilities”\nand the classification’s reference to “establishments,”\nwhich suggest industrial sites more fixed and permanent\nthan outdoor timber-harvesting operations. Ibid. See also\n55 Fed. Reg. 47990, 48008 (1990). This reading is re-\ninforced by the Industrial Stormwater Rule’s definition\nof discharges associated with industrial activity as dis-\ncharges “from any conveyance that is used for collecting\nand conveying storm water and that is directly related to\nmanufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas\nat an industrial plant.” 40 CFR §122.26(b)(14) (2006).\nThis language lends support to the EPA’s claim that the\nregulation does not cover temporary, outdoor logging\ninstallations. It was reasonable for the agency to conclude\nthat the conveyances at issue are “directly related” only to\nthe harvesting of raw materials, rather than to “manufac-\nturing,” “processing,” or “raw materials storage areas.”\nSee Oxford Dict. 1066 (manufacturing is “mak[ing] (some-\nthing) on a large scale using machinery”); id., at 1392\n(processing is “perform[ing] a series of mechanical or\nchemical operations on (something) in order to change or\npreserve it”). In addition, even if logging as a general\nmatter is a type of economic activity within the regula-\ntion’s scope, a reasonable interpretation of the regulation\ncould still require the discharges to be related in a direct\nway to operations “at an industrial plant” in order to be\nsubject to NPDES permitting.\n   NEDC resists this conclusion, noting that elsewhere in\nthe Industrial Stormwater Rule the EPA has required\nNPDES permits for stormwater discharges associated\nwith other types of outdoor economic activity.

In light of the language of the regulation just dis-\ncussed, moreover, the inclusion of these types of economic\nactivity in the Industrial Stormwater Rule need not be\nread to mandate that all stormwater discharges related to\nthese activities fall within the rule, just as the inclusion of\nlogging need not be read to extend to all discharges from\nlogging sites. The regulation’s reach may be limited by\nthe requirement that the discharges be “directly related to\nmanufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas\nat an industrial plant.” §122.26(b)(14).\n   It is well established that an agency’s interpretation\nneed not be the only possible reading of a regulation—or\neven the best one—to prevail. When an agency interprets\nits own regulation, the Court, as a general rule, defers to it\n“unless that interpretation is ‘plainly erroneous or incon-\nsistent with the regulation.’ ” Chase Bank USA, N. A. v.\nMcCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting\nAuer, 519 U. S., at 461). The EPA’s interpretation is\na permissible one. Taken together, the regulation’s ref-\nerences to “facilities,” “establishments,” “manufacturing,”\n“processing,” and an “industrial plant” leave open the\nrational interpretation that the regulation extends only to\ntraditional industrial buildings such as factories and\nassociated sites, as well as other relatively fixed facilities.\n   There is another reason to accord Auer deference to the\nEPA’s interpretation: there is no indication that its cur-\nrent view is a change from prior practice or a post hoc\njustification adopted in response to litigation. See Chris-\ntopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) (slip op., at 10). The opposite is the case. The\nagency has been consistent in its view that the types of\ndischarges at issue here do not require NPDES permits.\n   The EPA’s decision exists against a background of state\nregulation with respect to stormwater runoff from logging\nroads. The State of Oregon has made an extensive effort\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto develop a comprehensive set of best practices to manage\nstormwater runoff from logging roads. These practices\ninclude rules mandating filtration of stormwater runoff\nbefore it enters rivers and streams, Ore. Admin. Rule 629–\n625–0330(4) (2012); requiring logging companies to con-\nstruct roads using surfacing that minimizes the sediment\nin runoff, Rule 629–625–0700(2); and obligating firms to\ncease operations where such efforts fail to prevent vis-\nible increases in water turbidity, Rule 629–625–0700(3).\nOregon has invested substantial time and money in estab-\nlishing these practices. In addition, the development,\nsiting, maintenance, and regulation of roads—and in\nparticular of state forest roads—are areas in which Ore-\ngon has considerable expertise. In exercising the broad\ndiscretion the Clean Water Act gives the EPA in the realm\nof stormwater runoff, the agency could reasonably have\nconcluded that further federal regulation in this area\nwould be duplicative or counterproductive. Indeed, Con-\ngress has given express instructions to the EPA to work\n“in consultation with State and local officials” to alleviate\nstormwater pollution by developing the precise kind of\nbest management practices Oregon has established here.\n33 U.

Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410\n(1945); Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997).\n   Two Terms ago, in my separate concurrence in Talk\nAmerica, I expressed doubts about the validity of this\npractice. In that case, however, the agency’s interpreta-\ntion of the rule was also the fairest one, and no party had\nasked us to reconsider Auer. Today, however, the Court’s\ndeference to the agency makes the difference (note the\nCourt’s defensive insistence that the agency’s interpreta-\ntion need not be “the best one,” ante, at 14). And respon-\ndent has asked us, if necessary, to “ ‘reconsider Auer.’ ” I\nbelieve that it is time to do so. See Brief for Respondent\n42, n. 12; see also Brief for Law Professors on the Propri-\nety of Administrative Deference as Amici Curiae. This is\nespecially true because the circumstances of these cases\nillustrate Auer’s flaws in a particularly vivid way.\n   The canonical formulation of Auer deference is that we\nwill enforce an agency’s interpretation of its own rules\nunless that interpretation is “plainly erroneous or incon-\nsistent with the regulation.” Seminole Rock, supra, at 414.\nBut of course whenever the agency’s interpretation of the\nregulation is different from the fairest reading, it is in that\nsense “inconsistent” with the regulation. Obviously, that\nis not enough, or there would be nothing for Auer to do. In\npractice, Auer deference is Chevron deference applied to\nregulations rather than statutes. See Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837 (1984). The agency’s interpretation will be accepted if,\nthough not the fairest reading of the regulation, it is a\nplausible reading—within the scope of the ambiguity that\nthe regulation contains.\n   Our cases have not put forward a persuasive justifica-\ntion for Auer deference. The first case to apply it, Semi-\nnole Rock, offered no justification whatever—just the ipse\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

S., at 414. Our\nlater cases provide two principal explanations, neither of\nwhich has much to be said for it. See generally Stephen-\nson & Pogoriler, Seminole Rock’s Domain, 79 Geo. Wash.\nL. Rev. 1449, 1454–1458 (2011). First, some cases say\nthat the agency, as the drafter of the rule, will have some\nspecial insight into its intent when enacting it. E.g.,\nMartin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review\nComm’n, 499 U. S. 144, 150–153 (1991). The implied\npremise of this argument—that what we are looking for is\nthe agency’s intent in adopting the rule—is false. There is\ntrue of regulations what is true of statutes. As Justice\nHolmes put it: “[w]e do not inquire what the legislature\nmeant; we ask only what the statute means.” The Theory\nof Legal Interpretation, 12 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 419 (1899).\nWhether governing rules are made by the national legisla-\nture or an administrative agency, we are bound by what\nthey say, not by the unexpressed intention of those who\nmade them.\n   The other rationale our cases provide is that the agency\npossesses special expertise in administering its “ ‘complex\nand highly technical regulatory program.’ ” See, e.g.,\nThomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 512\n(1994). That is true enough, and it leads to the conclu-\nsion that agencies and not courts should make regula-\ntions. But it has nothing to do with who should interpret\nregulations—unless one believes that the purpose of inter-\npretation is to make the regulatory program work in a fashion\nthat the current leadership of the agency deems effective.\nMaking regulatory programs effective is the purpose of\nrulemaking, in which the agency uses its “special exper-\ntise” to formulate the best rule. But the purpose of inter-\npretation is to determine the fair meaning of the rule—to\n“say what the law is,” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,\n4    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                              CENTER\n\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J. \n\n\n177 (1803). Not to make policy, but to determine what\npolicy has been made and promulgated by the agency, to\nwhich the public owes obedience. Indeed, since the leader-\nship of agencies (and hence the policy preferences of agen-\ncies) changes with Presidential administrations, an agency\nhead can only be sure that the application of his “special\nexpertise” to the issue addressed by a regulation will be\ngiven effect if we adhere to predictable principles of textual\ninterpretation rather than defer to the “special expertise”\nof his successors. If we take agency enactments as writ-\nten, the Executive has a stable background against which\nto write its rules and achieve the policy ends it thinks\nbest.\n   Another conceivable justification for Auer deference,\nthough not one that is to be found in our cases, is this: If it\nis reasonable to defer to agencies regarding the meaning of\nstatutes that Congress enacted, as we do per Chevron, it is\na fortiori reasonable to defer to them regarding the mean-\ning of regulations that they themselves crafted. To give an\nagency less control over the meaning of its own regula-\ntions than it has over the meaning of a congressionally\nenacted statute seems quite odd.\n   But it is not odd at all. The theory of Chevron (take it or\nleave it) is that when Congress gives an agency authority\nto administer a statute, including authority to issue in-\nterpretive regulations, it implicitly accords the agency a\ndegree of discretion, which the courts must respect, re-\ngarding the meaning of the statute. See Smiley v. Citi-\nbank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 740–741 (1996).\nWhile the implication of an agency power to clarify the\nstatute is reasonable enough, there is surely no congres-\nsional implication that the agency can resolve ambiguities\nin its own regulations. For that would violate a funda-\nmental principle of separation of powers—that the power\nto write a law and the power to interpret it cannot rest\nin the same hands. “When the legislative and executive\n                   Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)               5\n\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J.\n\npowers are united in the same person . . . there can be no\nliberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same\nmonarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to exe-\ncute them in a tyrannical manner.” Montesquieu, Spirit\nof the Laws bk. XI, ch. 6, pp. 151–152 (O. Piest ed., T.\nNugent transl. 1949). Congress cannot enlarge its own\npower through Chevron—whatever it leaves vague in the\nstatute will be worked out by someone else. Chevron rep-\nresents a presumption about who, as between the Execu-\ntive and the Judiciary, that someone else will be. (The\nExecutive, by the way—the competing political branch—is\nthe less congenial repository of the power as far as Con-\ngress is concerned.) So Congress’s incentive is to speak as\nclearly as possible on the matters it regards as important.\n   But when an agency interprets its own rules—that is\nsomething else. Then the power to prescribe is augmented\nby the power to interpret; and the incentive is to speak\nvaguely and broadly, so as to retain a “flexibility” that\nwill enable “clarification” with retroactive effect. “It is per-\nfectly understandable” for an agency to “issue vague regula-\ntions” if doing so will “maximiz[e] agency power.” Thomas\nJefferson Univ., supra, at 525 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\nCombining the power to prescribe with the power to inter-\npret is not a new evil: Blackstone condemned the practice\nof resolving doubts about “the construction of the Roman\nlaws” by “stat[ing] the case to the emperor in writing, and\ntak[ing] his opinion upon it.” 1 W. Blackstone, Commen-\ntaries on the Laws of England 58 (1765). And our Consti-\ntution did not mirror the British practice of using the\nHouse of Lords as a court of last resort, due in part to the\nfear that he who has “agency in passing bad laws” might\noperate in the “same spirit” in their interpretation. The\nFederalist No. 81, pp. 543–544 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Auer\ndeference encourages agencies to be “vague in framing\nregulations, with the plan of issuing ‘interpretations’ to\ncreate the intended new law without observance of notice\n6    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                              CENTER\n\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J. \n\n\nand comment procedures.” Anthony, The Supreme Court\nand the APA: Sometimes They Just Don’t Get It, 10 Ad-\nmin. L. J. Am. U. 1, 11–12 (1996). Auer is not a logical\ncorollary to Chevron but a dangerous permission slip for\nthe arrogation of power. See Talk America, 564 U. S., at\n___ (SCALIA, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2–3); Manning,\nConstitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to Agency\nInterpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612\n(1996).\n   It is true enough that Auer deference has the same\nbeneficial pragmatic effect as Chevron deference: The\ncountry need not endure the uncertainty produced by\ndivergent views of numerous district courts and courts of\nappeals as to what is the fairest reading of the regulation,\nuntil a definitive answer is finally provided, years later, by\nthis Court. The agency’s view can be relied upon, unless it\nis, so to speak, beyond the pale. But the duration of the\nuncertainty produced by a vague regulation need not be as\nlong as the uncertainty produced by a vague statute. For\nas soon as an interpretation uncongenial to the agency is\npronounced by a district court, the agency can begin the\nprocess of amending the regulation to make its meaning\nentirely clear. The circumstances of this case demonstrate\nthe point. While these cases were being briefed before us,\nEPA issued a rule designed to respond to the Court of\nAppeals judgment we are reviewing. See 77 Fed. Reg.\n72974 (2012) (to be codified in 40 CFR pt. 122, sub pt. B).\nIt did so (by the standards of such things) relatively\nquickly: The decision below was handed down in May 2011,\nand in December 2012 the EPA published an amended\nrule setting forth in unmistakable terms the position it ar-\ngues here. And there is another respect in which a lack of\nChevron-type deference has less severe pragmatic conse-\nquences for rules than for statutes. In many cases, when\nan agency believes that its rule permits conduct that the\ntext arguably forbids, it can simply exercise its discretion\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

That is not possible, of course, when, as\nhere, a party harmed by the violation has standing to\ncompel enforcement.\n   In any case, however great may be the efficiency gains\nderived from Auer deference, beneficial effect cannot jus-\ntify a rule that not only has no principled basis but contra-\nvenes one of the great rules of separation of powers: He\nwho writes a law must not adjudge its violation.\n                              II\n   I would therefore resolve these cases by using the famil-\niar tools of textual interpretation to decide: Is what the\npetitioners did here proscribed by the fairest reading of\nthe regulations? What they did was to channel storm-\nwater runoff from logging roads without a permit. To\ndecide whether that was permissible we must answer one,\nand possibly two, questions: First, was the stormwater\ndischarged from a “point source”? If not, no permit was\nrequired. But if so, we face the second question: Were the\nstormwater discharges exempt from the permit require-\nment because they were not “associated with industrial\nactivity”? The fairest reading of the statute and regula-\ntions is that these discharges were from point sources, and\nwere associated with industrial activity.\n                              A\n  The Clean Water Act generally prohibits discharging\npollution without a permit from what it calls a “point\nsource.” 33 U. S. C. §1311(a). A “point source” is defined\nas “any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance,\nincluding but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel,\ntunnel, conduit,” and several other things. §1362(14). The\nstormwater here was discharged from logging roads\nthrough a series of pipes, ditches, and channels—all items\nexpressly named in the definition.\n  EPA argues that the Silvicultural Rule, 40 CFR\n8    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                              CENTER\n\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J. \n\n\n§122.27(b)(1) (2006), excludes from the definition of\n“[s]ilvicultural point source” “harvesting operations . . .\nfrom which there is natural runoff.” This is relevant, says\nthe agency, because that rule specifies that only\n“[s]ilvicultural point sources, as defined in this section,”\nare “point sources subject to the . . . permit program.”\n§122.27(a). In EPA’s view, the stormwater here is “natu-\nral runoff.”\n   But are stormwater discharges “natural runoff ” when\nthey are channeled through manmade pipes and ditches,\nand carry with them manmade pollutants from manmade\nforest roads? It is not obvious that this is so—as the agency\nagrees. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19\n(the rule’s “reference to ‘natural runoff ’ associated with\nlogging roads neither clearly encompasses nor clearly\nexcludes the sort of channeled runoff that is at issue in\nthis case”). In my view, giving the term the agency’s\ninterpretation would contradict the statute’s definition of\n“point source,” which explicitly includes any “pipe, ditch,\nchannel, tunnel, [and] conduit.” Applying the interpretive\npresumption of validity—the canon that we are to “prefe[r]\nthe meaning that preserves to the meaning that destroys,”\nPanama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388, 439 (1935)\n(Cardozo, J., dissenting)—I would hold that the regula-\ntion’s exclusion of “natural runoff ” does not reach the\nsituation here. The stormwater discharges came from point\nsources, because they flowed out of artificial “pipe[s],”\n“ditch[es],” and “channel[s],” 33 U. S. C. §1362(14), and\nwere thus not “natural runoff ” from a logging opera-\ntion, 40 CFR §122.27(b)(1) (emphasis added).\n                           B\n  Many point-source stormwater discharges are nonethe-\nless exempt from the usual permitting requirement. See\n33 U. S. C. §1342(p). This exemption, however, does not\nreach discharges “associated with industrial activity.”\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

Opening one’s hymnal to Standard\nIndustrial Classification 24 (“Lumber and Wood Products,\nExcept Furniture”), one finds that the first industry group\nlisted, No. 2411, is “Logging”—defined as “[e]stablish-\nments primarily engaged in cutting timber.” 2 App. 64.\n(As if that were not clear enough, an illustrative product of\nthis industry is helpfully listed: “Logs.”) That, I would\nthink, is that.\n   EPA disagrees, and the Court gives the agency’s posi-\ntion Auer deference, but that reading is certainly not the\nmost natural one. The Court relies heavily on the fact\nthat the definition of “[s]torm water discharge associ-\nated with industrial activity” requires that the discharge\nbe “directly related to manufacturing, processing or\nraw materials storage areas at an industrial plant,”\n§122.26(b)(14). The crucial question this definition pre-\nsents is whether the concluding phrase “at an industrial\nplant” limits only the last noun phrase (“raw materials\nstorage areas”) or also the two preceding nouns (“manufac-\nturing” and “processing”). The canon of interpretation\nknown as the rule of the last antecedent states that “a\nlimiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as\nmodifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately\n10   DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                              CENTER\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J.\n\nfollows.” Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U. S. 20, 26 (2003). If\na statute provides that “it shall be unlawful to possess a\ngrenade launcher, a fully-automatic weapon, or a shotgun\nwith a barrel shorter than 12 inches,” that does not mean\nthat a grenade launcher with a barrel longer than 12\ninches is legal. Application of the canon would mean that\n“at an industrial plant” modifies only “raw materials\nstorage areas,” and therefore that “manufacturing” and\n“processing” anywhere, including in the forest, would be\n“associated with industrial activity.” (Standard Industrial\nClassification 24 categorizes logging as a manufacturing\nbusiness, and these discharges are therefore “directly\nrelated to manufacturing.”)\n   Like all canons of interpretation, the rule of the last\nantecedent can be overcome by textual indication of\ncontrary meaning. But that does not exist here. To the\ncontrary, the enumerated categories of industries to\nwhich the term “industrial activity” applies reinforce the\nproposition that “at an industrial plant” does not\nmodify “manufacturing” or “processing.” The term in-\ncludes (in addition to logging) “active or inactive mining\noperations,” §122.26(b)(14)(iii); “[l]andfills” and “open\ndumps,” §122.26(b)(14)(v); “automobile junkyards,”\n§122.26(b)(14)(vi); and “[c]onstruction activity including\nclearing, grading and excavation,” §122.26(b)(14)(x).\nThose industries and activities (while related to manufac-\nturing and processing) virtually never take place at any-\nthing like what one might describe as a “plant.” The rule\nof the last antecedent is therefore confirmed as the correct\nguide to meaning here: “at an industrial plant” limits only\n“raw materials storage areas.”\n   EPA also insists, Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 24, that the regulation reaches only “ ‘traditional’ ”\nsources of industrial stormwater, such as sawmills. But\nStandard Industrial Classification 24 has a specific sub-\ncategory (No. 242) that is “Sawmills and Planing Mills.” 2\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

The rule is not so limited, reaching by its terms\n“Standard Industrial Classificatio[n] 24 (except 2434).”\n§122.26(b)(14)(ii). The explicit carving-out of No. 2434 is\ntelling: Why EPA chose to exclude “establishments pri-\nmarily engaged in manufacturing wood kitchen cabinet\nand wood bathroom vanities” from the definition of indus-\ntrial stormwater, I do not know—but the picayune nature\nof the exclusion gives lie to the idea that the rule’s scope\nought to be decided by a rough sense of its gestalt. If EPA\nhad meant to reach only sawmills, it quite obviously knew\nhow to do so.\n   Finally, the Court believes that Standard Industrial\nClassification 24’s reference to “establishments” “sug-\ngest[s] industrial sites more fixed and permanent than\noutdoor timber-harvesting operations.” Ante, at 13. Not\nso. The Standard Industrial Classification uses “es-\ntablishments” throughout to refer to business entities\nin general; for example, Classification 2411 refers to\n“[e]stablishments primarily engaged in cutting timber,”\nwhich includes “producing wood chips in the field.” 2 App.\n64. I cannot imagine what kind of “fixed and permanent”\nindustrial site the Court and EPA imagine will be “produc-\ning wood chips in the field.” And the Court’s final point,\nante, at 13—that the regulatory definition of “industrial\nactivity” uses the word “facilities”—cuts the other way:\nEPA regulations define “facility” to include “any . . . ‘point\nsource.’ ” 40 CFR §122.2; see, e.g., §122.26(b)(14)(iii) (re-\nferring to mines as “facilities”).\n   The agency also assures us that its intent (Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 25) was to reach a more\nlimited subset of logging activities, an intent that it be-\nlieves can essentially float free from the text of the rele-\nvant rule. In the end, this is the real meat of the matter:\nEPA states that it simply did not mean to require permits\nfor the discharges at issue here. And the Court is willing\nto credit that intent, even given what I think has been\n12   DECKER v.
