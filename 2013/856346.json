Argued November 5, 2012—Decided March 27, 2013\nPetitioners, Comcast Corporation and its subsidiaries, allegedly “clus-\n  ter” their cable television operations within a particular region by\n  swapping their systems outside the region for competitor systems in-\n  side the region. Respondents, named plaintiffs in this class-action\n  antitrust suit, claim that they and other Comcast subscribers in the\n  Philadelphia “cluster” are harmed because Comcast’s strategy lessens\n  competition and leads to supra-competitive prices. They sought class\n  certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), which\n  requires that “questions of law or fact common to class members pre-\n  dominate over any questions affecting only individual members.”\n  The District Court required them to show (1) that the “antitrust im-\n  pact” of the violation could be proved at trial through evidence com-\n  mon to the class and (2) that the damages were measurable on a\n  classwide basis through a “common methodology.” The court accept-\n  ed only one of respondents’ four proposed theories of antitrust impact:\n  that Comcast’s actions lessened competition from “overbuilders,” i.e.,\n  companies that build competing networks in areas where an incum-\n  bent cable company already operates. It then certified the class, find-\n  ing that the damages from overbuilder deterrence could be calculated\n  on a classwide basis, even though respondents’ expert acknowledged\n  that his regression model did not isolate damages resulting from any\n  one of respondents’ theories. In affirming, the Third Circuit refused\n  to consider petitioners’ argument that the model failed to attribute\n  damages to overbuilder deterrence because doing so would require\n  reaching the merits of respondents’ claims at the class certification\n  stage.\nHeld: Respondents’ class action was improperly certified under Rule\n 23(b)(3). Pp. 5–11.\n2                     COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n       (a) A party seeking to maintain a class action must be prepared to\n    show that Rule 23(a)’s numerosity, commonality, typicality, and ade-\n    quacy-of-representation requirements have been met, Wal-Mart\n    Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___, and must satisfy through ev-\n    identiary proof at least one of Rule 23(b)’s provisions. The same ana-\n    lytical principles govern certification under both Rule 23(a) and Rule\n    23(b). Courts may have to “ ‘probe behind the pleadings before com-\n    ing to rest on the certification question,’ and [a] certification is proper\n    only if ‘the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that [Rule\n    23’s] prerequisites . . . have been satisfied.’ ” Ibid. The analysis will\n    frequently “overlap with the merits of the plaintiff ’s underlying\n    claim” because a “ ‘class determination generally involves considera-\n    tions that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising\n    the plaintiff ’s cause of action.’ ” Ibid. Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) The Third Circuit ran afoul of this Court’s precedents when it\n    refused to entertain arguments against respondents’ damages model\n    that bore on the propriety of class certification simply because they\n    would also be pertinent to the merits determination. If they prevail,\n    respondents would be entitled only to damages resulting from re-\n    duced overbuilder competition. A model that does not attempt to\n    measure only those damages attributable to that theory cannot estab-\n    lish that damages are susceptible of measurement across the entire\n    class for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes. The lower courts’ contrary reasoning\n    flatly contradicts this Court’s cases, which require a determination\n    that Rule 23 is satisfied, even when that requires inquiry into the\n    merits of the claim. Wal-Mart, supra, at ___, and n. 6. Pp. 6–8.\n       (c) Under the proper standard for evaluating certification, respond-\n    ents’ model falls far short of establishing that damages can be meas-\n    ured classwide.

Because the model cannot bridge the dif-\n    ferences between supra-competitive prices in general and supra-\n    competitive prices attributable to overbuilder deterrence, Rule\n    23(b)(3) cannot authorize treating subscribers in the Philadelphia\n    cluster as members of a single class.

We consider\nwhether certification was appropriate under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).\n                             I\n  Comcast Corporation and its subsidiaries, petitioners\nhere, provide cable-television services to residential and\ncommercial customers. From 1998 to 2007, petitioners\nengaged in a series of transactions that the parties have\ndescribed as “clustering,” a strategy of concentrating op-\nerations within a particular region. The region at issue\nhere, which the parties have referred to as the Philadel-\nphia “cluster” or the Philadelphia “Designated Market\nArea” (DMA), includes 16 counties located in Pennsylvania,\nDelaware, and New Jersey.1 Petitioners pursued their\n——————\n  1 A “Designated Market Area” is a term used by Nielsen Media Re­\n\nsearch to define a broadcast-television market. Strictly speaking, the\n2                 COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nclustering strategy by acquiring competitor cable provid­\ners in the region and swapping their own systems outside\nthe region for competitor systems located in the region.\nFor instance, in 2001, petitioners obtained Adelphia Com-\nmunications’ cable systems in the Philadelphia DMA,\nalong with its 464,000 subscribers; in exchange, petition­\ners sold to Adelphia their systems in Palm Beach, Florida,\nand Los Angeles, California. As a result of nine cluster-\ning transactions, petitioners’ share of subscribers in the re-\ngion allegedly increased from 23.9 percent in 1998 to 69.5\npercent in 2007. See 264 F. R. D. 150, 156, n. 8, 160 (ED\nPa. 2010).\n   The named plaintiffs, respondents here, are subscribers\nto Comcast’s cable-television services. They filed a class­\naction antitrust suit against petitioners, claiming that\npetitioners entered into unlawful swap agreements, in\nviolation of §1 of the Sherman Act, and monopolized or at-\ntempted to monopolize services in the cluster, in viola­\ntion of §2. Ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C.\n§§1, 2. Petitioners’ clustering scheme, respondents con­\ntended, harmed subscribers in the Philadelphia cluster by\neliminating competition and holding prices for cable ser­\nvices above competitive levels.\n   Respondents sought to certify a class under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). That provision permits\ncertification only if “the court finds that the questions of\nlaw or fact common to class members predominate over\nany questions affecting only individual members.” The\nDistrict Court held, and it is uncontested here, that to\nmeet the predominance requirement respondents had to\nshow (1) that the existence of individual injury resulting\nfrom the alleged antitrust violation (referred to as “anti­\ntrust impact”) was “capable of proof at trial through\nevidence that [was] common to the class rather than indi­\n—————— \n\nPhiladelphia DMA comprises 18 counties, not 16. \n\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

R. D., at\n154.2\n   Respondents proposed four theories of antitrust impact:\nFirst, Comcast’s clustering made it profitable for Comcast\nto withhold local sports programming from its competi­\ntors, resulting in decreased market penetration by direct\nbroadcast satellite providers. Second, Comcast’s activities\nreduced the level of competition from “overbuilders,” com­\npanies that build competing cable networks in areas\nwhere an incumbent cable company already operates.\nThird, Comcast reduced the level of “benchmark” competi­\ntion on which cable customers rely to compare prices.\nFourth, clustering increased Comcast’s bargaining power\nrelative to content providers. Each of these forms of im­\npact, respondents alleged, increased cable subscription\nrates throughout the Philadelphia DMA.\n   The District Court accepted the overbuilder theory of\nantitrust impact as capable of classwide proof and rejected\nthe rest. Id., at 165, 174, 178, 181. Accordingly, in its\ncertification order, the District Court limited respondents’\n“proof of antitrust impact” to “the theory that Comcast\nengaged in anticompetitive clustering conduct, the effect of\nwhich was to deter the entry of overbuilders in the Phila­\ndelphia DMA.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 192a–193a.3\n——————\n  2 Respondents    sought certification for the following class: “All cable\ntelevision customers who subscribe or subscribed at any times since\nDecember 1, 1999, to the present to video programming services (other\nthan solely to basic cable services) from Comcast, or any of its subsidi­\naries or affiliates in Comcast’s Philadelphia cluster.” App. 35a.\n   3 The District Court did not hold that the three alternative theories of\n\nliability failed to establish antitrust impact, but merely that those\ntheories could not be determined in a manner common to all the class\nplaintiffs. The other theories of liability may well be available for\nthe plaintiffs to pursue as individual actions. Any contention that the\nplaintiffs should be allowed to recover damages attributable to all four\n4                COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court further found that the damages\nresulting from overbuilder-deterrence impact could be\ncalculated on a classwide basis. To establish such dam-\nages, respondents had relied solely on the testimony of Dr.\nJames McClave. Dr. McClave designed a regression model\ncomparing actual cable prices in the Philadelphia DMA\nwith hypothetical prices that would have prevailed but\nfor petitioners’ allegedly anticompetitive activities. The\nmodel calculated damages of $875,576,662 for the entire\nclass. App. 1388a (sealed). As Dr. McClave acknowledged,\nhowever, the model did not isolate damages resulting\nfrom any one theory of antitrust impact. Id., at 189a–\n190a. The District Court nevertheless certified the class.\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. On\nappeal, petitioners contended the class was improperly\ncertified because the model, among other shortcomings,\nfailed to attribute damages resulting from overbuilder\ndeterrence, the only theory of injury remaining in the case.\nThe court refused to consider the argument because, in its\nview, such an “attac[k] on the merits of the methodology\n[had] no place in the class certification inquiry.” 655 F. 3d\n182, 207 (CA3 2011). The court emphasized that, “[a]t\nthe class certification stage,” respondents were not required\nto “tie each theory of antitrust impact to an exact calcula­\ntion of damages.” Id., at 206. According to the court, it\nhad “not reached the stage of determining on the merits\nwhether the methodology is a just and reasonable infer­\nence or speculative.” Ibid. Rather, the court said, re­\nspondents must “assure us that if they can prove antitrust\nimpact, the resulting damages are capable of measure­\nment and will not require labyrinthine individual calcula­\n\n——————\ntheories in this class action would erroneously suggest one of two\nthings—either that the plaintiffs may also recover such damages in\nindividual actions or that they are precluded from asserting those\ntheories in individual actions.\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

In the court’s view, that burden was met\nbecause respondents’ model calculated “supra-competitive\nprices regardless of the type of anticompetitive conduct.”\nId., at 205.\n   We granted certiorari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).4\n                             II\n   The class action is “an exception to the usual rule that\nlitigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual\nnamed parties only.” Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682,\n700–701 (1979). To come within the exception, a party\nseeking to maintain a class action “must affirmatively\ndemonstrate his compliance” with Rule 23. Wal-Mart\nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n10). The Rule “does not set forth a mere pleading stand­\nard.” Ibid. Rather, a party must not only “be prepared to\nprove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties,\ncommon questions of law or fact,” typicality of claims or\ndefenses, and adequacy of representation, as required by\nRule 23(a). Ibid. The party must also satisfy through\nevidentiary proof at least one of the provisions of Rule\n——————\n   4 The question presented reads: “Whether a district court may certify\n\na class action without resolving whether the plaintiff class had intro­\nduced admissible evidence, including expert testimony, to show that the\ncase is susceptible to awarding damages on a class-wide basis.” 567\nU. S., at ___. Respondents contend that petitioners forfeited their\nability to answer this question in the negative because they did not\nmake an objection to the admission of Dr. McClave’s testimony under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharma-\nceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579 (1993). Such a forfeit would make it\nimpossible for petitioners to argue that Dr. McClave’s testimony was\nnot “admissible evidence” under the Rules; but it does not make it\nimpossible for them to argue that the evidence failed “to show that the\ncase is susceptible to awarding damages on a class-wide basis.” Peti­\ntioners argued below, and continue to argue here, that certification was\nimproper because respondents had failed to establish that damages\ncould be measured on a classwide basis. That is the question we\naddress here.\n6                COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n23(b). The provision at issue here is Rule 23(b)(3), which\nrequires a court to find that “the questions of law or fact\ncommon to class members predominate over any questions\naffecting only individual members.”\n   Repeatedly, we have emphasized that it “ ‘may be neces­\nsary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before\ncoming to rest on the certification question,’ and that\ncertification is proper only if ‘the trial court is satisfied,\nafter a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule\n23(a) have been satisfied.’ ” Ibid. (quoting General Tele-\nphone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, 160–161\n(1982)). Such an analysis will frequently entail “overlap\nwith the merits of the plaintiff ’s underlying claim.” 564\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). That is so because the “ ‘class\ndetermination generally involves considerations that are\nenmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the\nplaintiff ’s cause of action.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Falcon, supra,\nat 160).\n   The same analytical principles govern Rule 23(b). If\nanything, Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance criterion is even\nmore demanding than Rule 23(a). Amchem Products, Inc.\nv. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 623–624 (1997). Rule 23(b)(3),\nas an “ ‘adventuresome innovation,’ ” is designed for situa­\ntions “ ‘in which “class-action treatment is not as clearly\ncalled for.” ’ ” Wal-Mart, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 22)\n(quoting Amchem, 521 U. S., at 614–615). That explains\nCongress’s addition of procedural safeguards for (b)(3)\nclass members beyond those provided for (b)(1) or (b)(2)\nclass members (e.g., an opportunity to opt out), and the\ncourt’s duty to take a “ ‘close look’ ” at whether common\nquestions predominate over individual ones. Id., at 615.\n                           III\n  Respondents’ class action was improperly certified un­\nder Rule 23(b)(3). By refusing to entertain arguments\nagainst respondents’ damages model that bore on the\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npropriety of class certification, simply because those ar­\nguments would also be pertinent to the merits determina­\ntion, the Court of Appeals ran afoul of our precedents\nrequiring precisely that inquiry. And it is clear that,\nunder the proper standard for evaluating certification,\nrespondents’ model falls far short of establishing that\ndamages are capable of measurement on a classwide basis.\nWithout presenting another methodology, respondents\ncannot show Rule 23(b)(3) predominance: Questions of\nindividual damage calculations will inevitably overwhelm\nquestions common to the class. This case thus turns on\nthe straightforward application of class-certification prin­\nciples; it provides no occasion for the dissent’s extended\ndiscussion, post, at 5–11 (GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ.,\ndissenting), of substantive antitrust law.\n                              A\n   We start with an unremarkable premise. If respondents\nprevail on their claims, they would be entitled only to\ndamages resulting from reduced overbuilder competition,\nsince that is the only theory of antitrust impact accepted\nfor class-action treatment by the District Court. It follows\nthat a model purporting to serve as evidence of damages in\nthis class action must measure only those damages at­\ntributable to that theory. If the model does not even at­\ntempt to do that, it cannot possibly establish that damages\nare susceptible of measurement across the entire class for\npurposes of Rule 23(b)(3). Calculations need not be exact,\nsee Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co.,\n282 U. S. 555, 563 (1931), but at the class-certification\nstage (as at trial), any model supporting a “plaintiff ’s\ndamages case must be consistent with its liability case,\nparticularly with respect to the alleged anticompetitive\neffect of the violation.” ABA Section of Antitrust Law,\nProving Antitrust Damages: Legal and Economic Issues\n57, 62 (2d ed. 2010); see, e.g., Image Tech. Servs. v. East-\n8                   COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nman Kodak Co., 125 F. 3d 1195, 1224 (CA9 1997). And for\npurposes of Rule 23, courts must conduct a “ ‘rigorous\nanalysis’ ” to determine whether that is so. Wal-Mart,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n  The District Court and the Court of Appeals saw no\nneed for respondents to “tie each theory of antitrust im­\npact” to a calculation of damages. 655 F. 3d, at 206. That,\nthey said, would involve consideration of the “merits”\nhaving “no place in the class certification inquiry.” Id.,\nat 206–207. That reasoning flatly contradicts our cases\nrequiring a determination that Rule 23 is satisfied, even\nwhen that requires inquiry into the merits of the claim.\nWal-Mart, supra, at ___, and n. 6 (slip op., at 10–11, and\nn. 6). The Court of Appeals simply concluded that re­\nspondents “provided a method to measure and quantify\ndamages on a classwide basis,” finding it unnecessary to\ndecide “whether the methodology [was] a just and reason­\nable inference or speculative.” 655 F. 3d, at 206. Under\nthat logic, at the class-certification stage any method of\nmeasurement is acceptable so long as it can be applied\nclasswide, no matter how arbitrary the measurements\nmay be. Such a proposition would reduce Rule 23(b)(3)’s\npredominance requirement to a nullity.\n                              B\n  There is no question that the model failed to measure\ndamages resulting from the particular antitrust injury\non which petitioners’ liability in this action is premised.5\n——————\n  5 The dissent is of the view that what an econometric model proves is\n\na “question of fact” on which we will not “undertake to review concur­\nrent findings . . . by two courts below in the absence of a very obvious\nand exceptional showing of error.” Post, at 9 (quoting United States v.\nVirginia, 518 U. S. 515, 589, n. 5 (1996) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (inter­\nnal quotation marks omitted)). To begin with, neither of the courts\nbelow found that the model established damages attributable to over­\nbuilding alone. Second, while the data contained within an econometric\nmodel may well be “questions of fact” in the relevant sense, what those\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nThe scheme devised by respondents’ expert, Dr. McClave,\nsought to establish a “but for” baseline—a figure that\nwould show what the competitive prices would have been\nif there had been no antitrust violations. Damages would\nthen be determined by comparing to that baseline what\nthe actual prices were during the charged period. The\n“but for” figure was calculated, however, by assuming a\nmarket that contained none of the four distortions that\nrespondents attributed to petitioners’ actions. In other\nwords, the model assumed the validity of all four theories\nof antitrust impact initially advanced by respondents:\ndecreased penetration by satellite providers, overbuilder\ndeterrence, lack of benchmark competition, and increased\nbargaining power.      At the evidentiary hearing, Dr.\nMcClave expressly admitted that the model calculated\ndamages resulting from “the alleged anticompetitive\nconduct as a whole” and did not attribute damages to\nany one particular theory of anticompetitive impact. App.\n189a–190a, 208a.\n   This methodology might have been sound, and might\nhave produced commonality of damages, if all four of those\nalleged distortions remained in the case. But as Judge\nJordan’s partial dissent pointed out:\n     “[B]ecause the only surviving theory of antitrust im­\n     pact is that clustering reduced overbuilding, for Dr.\n     McClave’s comparison to be relevant, his benchmark\n     counties must reflect the conditions that would have\n     prevailed in the Philadelphia DMA but for the alleged\n     reduction in overbuilding. In all respects unrelated to\n     reduced overbuilding, the benchmark counties should\n\n—————— \n\ndata prove is no more a question of fact than what our opinions hold.\n\nAnd finally, even if it were a question of fact, concluding that the model \n\nhere established damages attributable to overbuilding alone would be\n\n“obvious[ly] and exceptional[ly]” erroneous. \n\n10                 COMCAST CORP. v.

But such assurance\nis not provided by a methodology that identifies damages\nthat are not the result of the wrong. For all we know,\ncable subscribers in Gloucester County may have been\novercharged because of petitioners’ alleged elimination of\nsatellite competition (a theory of liability that is not ca-\npable of classwide proof ); while subscribers in Camden\nCounty may have paid elevated prices because of petitioners’\nincreased bargaining power vis-à-vis content providers\n(another theory that is not capable of classwide proof );\nwhile yet other subscribers in Montgomery County may\nhave paid rates produced by the combined effects of multi­\nple forms of alleged antitrust harm; and so on. The per­\nmutations involving four theories of liability and 2 million\nsubscribers located in 16 counties are nearly endless.\n   In light of the model’s inability to bridge the differences\nbetween supra-competitive prices in general and supra­\ncompetitive prices attributable to the deterrence of over­\nbuilding, Rule 23(b)(3) cannot authorize treating subscrib­\ners within the Philadelphia cluster as members of a single\nclass.6 Prices whose level above what an expert deems\n——————\n  6 We might add that even if the model had identified subscribers who\n\npaid more solely because of the deterrence of overbuilding, it still would\nnot have established the requisite commonality of damages unless it\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

On both procedural and substantive\ngrounds, we dissent.\n                              I\n   This case comes to the Court infected by our misguided\nreformulation of the question presented. For that reason\nalone, we would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvi­\ndently granted.\n   Comcast sought review of the following question:\n“[W]hether a district court may certify a class action with­\nout resolving ‘merits arguments’ that bear on [Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure] 23’s prerequisites for certifica­\ntion, including whether purportedly common issues pre­\ndominate over individual ones under Rule 23(b)(3).” Pet.\nfor Cert. i. We granted review of a different question:\n“Whether a district court may certify a class action with­\nout resolving whether the plaintiff class has introduced\nadmissible evidence, including expert testimony, to show\nthat the case is susceptible to awarding damages on a\nclass-wide basis.” 567 U. S. ___ (2012) (emphasis added).\n   Our rephrasing shifted the focus of the dispute from the\nDistrict Court’s Rule 23(b)(3) analysis to its attention (or\n2               COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nlack thereof) to the admissibility of expert testimony. The\nparties, responsively, devoted much of their briefing to the\nquestion whether the standards for admissibility of expert\nevidence set out in Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and\nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S.\n579 (1993), apply in class certification proceedings. See\nBrief for Petitioners 35–49; Brief for Respondents 24–37.\nIndeed, respondents confirmed at oral argument that they\nunderstood our rewritten question to center on admissibil­\nity, not Rule 23(b)(3). See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 25.\n   As it turns out, our reformulated question was inapt. To\npreserve a claim of error in the admission of evidence, a\nparty must timely object to or move to strike the evidence.\nFed. Rule Evid. 103(a)(1). In the months preceding the\nDistrict Court’s class certification order, Comcast did not\nobject to the admission of Dr. McClave’s damages model\nunder Rule 702 or Daubert. Nor did Comcast move to\nstrike his testimony and expert report. Consequently,\nComcast forfeited any objection to the admission of Dr.\nMcClave’s model at the certification stage. At this late\ndate, Comcast may no longer argue that respondents’\ndamages evidence was inadmissible.\n   Comcast’s forfeiture of the question on which we granted\nreview is reason enough to dismiss the writ as improvi­\ndently granted. See Rogers v. United States, 522 U. S.\n252, 259 (1998) (O’Connor, J., concurring in result) (“[W]e\nought not to decide the question if it has not been cleanly\npresented.”); The Monrosa v. Carbon Black Export, Inc.,\n359 U. S. 180, 183 (1959) (dismissal appropriate in light\nof “circumstances . . . not fully apprehended at the time\ncertiorari was granted” (internal quotation marks omit­\nted)). The Court, however, elects to evaluate whether re­\nspondents “failed to show that the case is susceptible to\nawarding damages on a class-wide basis.” Ante, at 5, n. 4\n(internal quotation marks omitted). To justify this second\nrevision of the question presented, the Court observes that\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nComcast “argued below, and continue[s] to argue here,\nthat certification was improper because respondents had\nfailed to establish that damages could be measured on a\nclasswide basis.” Ibid. And so Comcast did, in addition to\nendeavoring to address the question on which we granted\nreview. By treating the first part of our reformulated\nquestion as though it did not exist, the Court is hardly fair\nto respondents.\n  Abandoning the question we instructed the parties to\nbrief does “not reflect well on the processes of the Court.”\nRedrup v. New York, 386 U. S. 767, 772 (1967) (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting). Taking their cue from our order, respondents\ndid not train their energies on defending the District\nCourt’s finding of predominance in their briefing or at oral\nargument. The Court’s newly revised question, focused on\npredominance, phrased only after briefing was done, left\nrespondents without an unclouded opportunity to air the\nissue the Court today decides against them. And by re­\nsolving a complex and fact-intensive question without the\nbenefit of full briefing, the Court invites the error into\nwhich it has fallen. See infra, at 5–11.\n                              II\n   While the Court’s decision to review the merits of the\nDistrict Court’s certification order is both unwise and un­\nfair to respondents, the opinion breaks no new ground on\nthe standard for certifying a class action under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). In particular, the deci­\nsion should not be read to require, as a prerequisite to\ncertification, that damages attributable to a classwide\ninjury be measurable “ ‘on a class-wide basis.’ ” See ante,\nat 2–3 (acknowledging Court’s dependence on the absence\nof contest on the matter in this case); Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.\n   To gain class-action certification under Rule 23(b)(3),\nthe named plaintiff must demonstrate, and the District\nCourt must find, “that the questions of law or fact common\n4                  COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n                 GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nto class members predominate over any questions affect­\ning only individual members.” This predominance re­\nquirement is meant to “tes[t] whether proposed classes are\nsufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by represen­\ntation,” Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591,\n623 (1997), but it scarcely demands commonality as to all\nquestions. See 7AA C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane,\nFederal Practice and Procedure §1778, p. 121 (3d ed. 2005)\n(hereinafter Wright, Miller, & Kane). In particular, when\nadjudication of questions of liability common to the class\nwill achieve economies of time and expense, the predomi­\nnance standard is generally satisfied even if damages are\nnot provable in the aggregate. See Advisory Committee’s\n1966 Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U. S. C. App.,\np. 141 (“[A] fraud perpetrated on numerous persons by\nthe use of similar misrepresentations may be an appealing\nsituation for a class action, and it may remain so despite\nthe need, if liability is found, for separate determination of\nthe damages suffered by individuals within the class.”);\n7AA Wright, Miller, & Kane §1781, at 235–237.*\n   Recognition that individual damages calculations do not\npreclude class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is well nigh\nuniversal. See 2 W. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Ac­\ntions §4:54, p. 205 (5th ed. 2012) (ordinarily, “individual\ndamage[s] calculations should not scuttle class certifica­\ntion under Rule 23(b)(3)”). Legions of appellate decisions\nacross a range of substantive claims are illustrative. See,\ne.g., Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F. 3d 1, 6 (CA1 2004)\n(Fourth Amendment); Chiang v.

As\nthis Court has rightly observed, “[p]redominance is a test\nreadily met” in actions alleging “violations of the antitrust\nlaws.” Amchem, 521 U.

And in doing so, it relies on its own version\nof the facts, a version inconsistent with factual findings\nmade by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of\nAppeals.\n6               COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\n                              A\n   To understand the antitrust problem, some (simplified)\nbackground discussion is necessary. Plaintiffs below, re­\nspondents here, alleged that Comcast violated §§1 and 2\nof the Sherman Act. See 15 U. S. C. §§1, 2. For present\npurposes, the §2 claim provides the better illustration. A\nfirm is guilty of monopolization under §2 if the plaintiff\nproves (1) “the possession of monopoly power in the rele­\nvant market” and (2) “the willful acquisition or mainte­\nnance of that power[,] as distinguished from growth or\ndevelopment as a consequence of a superior product, busi­\nness acumen, or historic accident.” United States v.\nGrinnell Corp., 384 U. S. 563, 570–571 (1966). A private\nplaintiff seeking damages must also show that (3) the\nmonopolization caused “injur[y].” 15 U. S. C. §15. We\nhave said that antitrust injuries must be “of the type the\nantitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flo[w]\nfrom that which makes defendants’ acts unlawful.” Atlan-\ntic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U. S. 328, 334\n(1990) (quoting Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat,\nInc., 429 U. S. 477, 489 (1977)). See 2A Areeda & Ho­\nvenkamp ¶391a, at 320 (To prove antitrust injury, “[a]\nprivate plaintiff must identify the economic rationale for a\nbusiness practice’s illegality under the antitrust laws and\nshow that its harm flows from whatever it is that makes\nthe practice unlawful.”).\n   As plaintiffs below, respondents attempted to meet\nthese requirements by showing that (1) Comcast obtained\na 60% or greater share of the Philadelphia market, and\nthat its share provides it with monopoly power; (2) Com­\ncast acquired its share through exclusionary conduct\nconsisting of a series of mergers with competitors and\n“swaps” of customers and locations; and (3) Comcast con­\nsequently injured respondents by charging them supra­\ncompetitive prices.\n   If, as respondents contend, Philadelphia is a separate\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

A market, such as the one alleged by\nrespondents, where one firm controls 60% is far worse.\nSee id., §5.3, at 18–19, and n. 9 (using a concentration\nindex that determines a market’s concentration level by\nsumming the squares of each firm’s market share, one\nfirm with 100% yielding 10,000, five firms with 20% each\nyielding 2000, while a market where one firm accounts for\n60% yields an index number of at least 3,600). The Guide­\nlines, and any standard antitrust treatise, explain why\nfirms in highly concentrated markets normally have the\npower to raise prices significantly above competitive lev­\nels. See, e.g., 2B Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶503, at 115.\n                              B\n   So far there is agreement. But consider the last matter\nrespondents must prove: Can they show that Comcast\ninjured them by charging higher prices? After all, a firm\nwith monopoly power will not necessarily exercise that\npower by charging higher prices. It could instead act less\ncompetitively in other ways, such as by leading the quiet\nlife. See J. Hicks, Annual Survey of Economic Theory: The\nTheory of Monopoly, 3 Econometrica 1, 8 (1935) (“The best\nof all monopoly profits is a quiet life.”).\n   It is at this point that Dr. McClave’s model enters the\nscene. His model first selects a group of comparable\noutside-Philadelphia “benchmark” counties, where Comcast\nenjoyed a lower market share (and where satellite broad­\ncasting accounted for more of the local business). Using\nmultiple regression analysis, McClave’s model measures\n8               COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nthe effect of the anticompetitive conduct by comparing\nthe class counties to the benchmark counties. The model\nconcludes that the prices Philadelphia area consumers\nwould have paid had the Philadelphia counties shared\nthe properties of the benchmark counties (including a\ndiminished Comcast market share), would have been\n13.1% lower than those they actually paid. Thus, the model\nprovides evidence that Comcast’s anticompetitive conduct,\nwhich led to a 60% market share, caused the class to\nsuffer injuriously higher prices.\n                              C\n                              1\n   The special antitrust-related difficulty present here\nstems from the manner in which respondents attempted\nto prove their antitrust injuries. They proffered four\n“non-exclusive mechanisms” that allegedly “cause[d] the\nhigh prices” in the Philadelphia area. App. 403a. Those four\ntheories posit that (1) due to Comcast’s acquisitions of\ncompetitors, customers found it more difficult to compare\nprices; (2) one set of potential competitors, namely Direct\nBroadcast Satellite companies, found it more difficult to\nobtain access to local sports broadcasts and consequently\ndecided not to enter the Philadelphia market; (3) Com­\ncast’s ability to obtain programming material at lower\nprices permitted it to raise prices; and (4) a number of\npotential competitors (called “overbuilders”), whose pres­\nence in the market would have limited Comcast’s power to\nraise prices, were ready to enter some parts of the market\nbut decided not to do so in light of Comcast’s anticompeti­\ntive conduct. 264 F. R. D. 150, 161–162 (ED Pa. 2010).\n   For reasons not here relevant, the District Court found\nthe first three theories inapplicable and limited the\nliability-phase proof to the “overbuilder” theory. See App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 192a–193a. It then asked the parties to\nbrief whether doing so had any impact on the viability of\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nMcClave’s model as a measure of classwide damages. See\n264 F. R. D., at 190. After considering the parties’ argu­\nments, the District Court found that striking the three\ntheories “does not impeach Dr. McClave’s damages model”\nbecause “[a]ny anticompetitive conduct is reflected in the\n[higher Philadelphia] price [which Dr. McClave’s model\ndetermines], not in the [the model’s] selection of the\ncomparison counties, [i.e., the lower-price ‘benchmark\ncounties’ with which the Philadelphia area prices were\ncompared].” Id., at 190–191. The court explained that\n“whether or not we accepted all [four] . . . theories . . . is\ninapposite to Dr. McClave’s methods of choosing bench­\nmarks.” Ibid. On appeal, the Third Circuit held that this\nfinding was not an abuse of discretion. 655 F. 3d 182, 207\n(2011).\n                              2\n   The Court, however, concludes that “the model failed to\nmeasure damages resulting from the particular antitrust\ninjury on which petitioners’ liability in this action is prem­\nised.” Ante, at 8. To reach this conclusion the Court must\nconsider fact-based matters, namely what this econometric\nmultiple-regression model is about, what it proves, and\nhow it does so. And it must overturn two lower courts’\nrelated factual findings to the contrary.\n   We are normally “reluctant to disturb findings of fact in\nwhich two courts below have concurred.” United States v.\nDoe, 465 U. S. 605, 614 (1984). See also United States v.\nVirginia, 518 U. S. 515, 589, n. 5 (1996) (SCALIA, J., dis­\nsenting) (noting “our well-settled rule that we will not\n‘undertake to review concurrent findings of fact by two\ncourts below in the absence of a very obvious and excep­\ntional showing of error’ ” (quoting Graver Tank & Mfg. Co.\nv. Linde Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271, 275 (1949))).\nHere, the District Court found McClave’s econometric\nmodel capable of measuring damages on a classwide basis,\n10              COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\neven after striking three of the injury theories. 264\nF. R. D., at 190–191. Contrary to the Court’s characteriza­\ntion, see ante, at 8–9, n. 5, this was not a legal conclusion\nabout what the model proved; it was a factual finding\nabout how the model worked. Under our typical practice,\nwe should leave that finding alone.\n   In any event, as far as we can tell, the lower courts were\nright. On the basis of the record as we understand it, the\nDistrict Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that\nMcClave’s model could measure damages suffered by the\nclass—even if the damages were limited to those caused by\ndeterred overbuilding. That is because respondents al­\nleged that Comcast’s anticompetitive conduct increased\nComcast’s market share (and market power) by deterring\npotential entrants, in particular, overbuilders, from enter­\ning the Philadelphia area market. See App. 43a–66a. By\nshowing that this was so, respondents’ proof tends to show\nthe same in respect to other entrants. The overbuilders’\nfailure to enter deprives the market of the price discipline\nthat their entry would have provided in other parts via\nthreat of the overbuilders’ expansion or that of others\npotentially led on by their example. Indeed, in the District\nCourt, Comcast argued that the three other theories,\ni.e., the three rejected theories, had no impact on prices.\nSee 264 F. R. D., at 166, 176, 180–181. If Comcast was\nright, then the damages McClave’s model found must\nhave stemmed exclusively from conduct that deterred new\nentry, say from “overbuilders.” Not surprisingly, the\nCourt offers no support at all for its contrary conclusion,\nnamely, that the District Court’s finding was “ ‘obvious[ly]\nand exceptional[ly]’ erroneous.” Ante, at 8–9, n. 5 (quoting\nVirginia, 518 U. S., at 589, n. 5 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)).\n   We are particularly concerned about the matter because\nthe Court, in reaching its contrary conclusion, makes\nbroad statements about antitrust law that it could not\nmean to apply in other cases. The Court begins with what\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nit calls an “unremarkable premise” that respondents could\nbe “entitled only to damages resulting from reduced over­\nbuilder competition.” Ante, at 7. In most §2 cases, how­\never, the Court’s starting place would seem remarkable, not\n“unremarkable.”\n   Suppose in a different case a plaintiff were to prove that\nWidget, Inc. has obtained, through anticompetitive means,\na 90% share of the California widget market. Suppose the\nplaintiff also proves that the two small remaining firms—\none in Ukiah, the other in San Diego—lack the capacity to\nexpand their widget output to the point where that pos­\nsibility could deter Widget, Inc. from raising its prices.\nSuppose further that the plaintiff introduces a model that\nshows California widget prices are now twice those in\nevery other State, which, the model concludes is (after\naccounting for other possible reasons) the result of lack of\ncompetition in the California widget market. Why would a\ncourt hearing that case restrict damages solely to custom­\ners in the vicinity of Ukiah and San Diego?\n   Like the model in this example, Dr. McClave’s model\ndoes not purport to show precisely how Comcast’s conduct\nled to higher prices in the Philadelphia area. It simply\nshows that Comcast’s conduct brought about higher prices.\nAnd it measures the amount of subsequent harm.\n                        *    *     *\n  Because the parties did not fully argue the question the\nCourt now answers, all Members of the Court may lack a\ncomplete understanding of the model or the meaning of\nrelated statements in the record. The need for focused\nargument is particularly strong here where, as we have\nsaid, the underlying considerations are detailed, technical,\nand fact-based. The Court departs from our ordinary\npractice, risks inaccurate judicial decisionmaking, and is\nunfair to respondents and the courts below.

Argued November 5, 2012—Decided March 27, 2013\nPetitioners, Comcast Corporation and its subsidiaries, allegedly “clus-\n  ter” their cable television operations within a particular region by\n  swapping their systems outside the region for competitor systems in-\n  side the region. Respondents, named plaintiffs in this class-action\n  antitrust suit, claim that they and other Comcast subscribers in the\n  Philadelphia “cluster” are harmed because Comcast’s strategy lessens\n  competition and leads to supra-competitive prices. They sought class\n  certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), which\n  requires that “questions of law or fact common to class members pre-\n  dominate over any questions affecting only individual members.”\n  The District Court required them to show (1) that the “antitrust im-\n  pact” of the violation could be proved at trial through evidence com-\n  mon to the class and (2) that the damages were measurable on a\n  classwide basis through a “common methodology.” The court accept-\n  ed only one of respondents’ four proposed theories of antitrust impact:\n  that Comcast’s actions lessened competition from “overbuilders,” i.e.,\n  companies that build competing networks in areas where an incum-\n  bent cable company already operates. It then certified the class, find-\n  ing that the damages from overbuilder deterrence could be calculated\n  on a classwide basis, even though respondents’ expert acknowledged\n  that his regression model did not isolate damages resulting from any\n  one of respondents’ theories. In affirming, the Third Circuit refused\n  to consider petitioners’ argument that the model failed to attribute\n  damages to overbuilder deterrence because doing so would require\n  reaching the merits of respondents’ claims at the class certification\n  stage.\nHeld: Respondents’ class action was improperly certified under Rule\n 23(b)(3). Pp. 5–11.\n2                     COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n       (a) A party seeking to maintain a class action must be prepared to\n    show that Rule 23(a)’s numerosity, commonality, typicality, and ade-\n    quacy-of-representation requirements have been met, Wal-Mart\n    Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___, and must satisfy through ev-\n    identiary proof at least one of Rule 23(b)’s provisions. The same ana-\n    lytical principles govern certification under both Rule 23(a) and Rule\n    23(b). Courts may have to “ ‘probe behind the pleadings before com-\n    ing to rest on the certification question,’ and [a] certification is proper\n    only if ‘the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that [Rule\n    23’s] prerequisites . . . have been satisfied.’ ” Ibid. The analysis will\n    frequently “overlap with the merits of the plaintiff ’s underlying\n    claim” because a “ ‘class determination generally involves considera-\n    tions that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising\n    the plaintiff ’s cause of action.’ ” Ibid. Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) The Third Circuit ran afoul of this Court’s precedents when it\n    refused to entertain arguments against respondents’ damages model\n    that bore on the propriety of class certification simply because they\n    would also be pertinent to the merits determination. If they prevail,\n    respondents would be entitled only to damages resulting from re-\n    duced overbuilder competition. A model that does not attempt to\n    measure only those damages attributable to that theory cannot estab-\n    lish that damages are susceptible of measurement across the entire\n    class for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes. The lower courts’ contrary reasoning\n    flatly contradicts this Court’s cases, which require a determination\n    that Rule 23 is satisfied, even when that requires inquiry into the\n    merits of the claim.

Because the model cannot bridge the dif-\n    ferences between supra-competitive prices in general and supra-\n    competitive prices attributable to overbuilder deterrence, Rule\n    23(b)(3) cannot authorize treating subscribers in the Philadelphia\n    cluster as members of a single class.

We consider\nwhether certification was appropriate under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).\n                             I\n  Comcast Corporation and its subsidiaries, petitioners\nhere, provide cable-television services to residential and\ncommercial customers. From 1998 to 2007, petitioners\nengaged in a series of transactions that the parties have\ndescribed as “clustering,” a strategy of concentrating op-\nerations within a particular region. The region at issue\nhere, which the parties have referred to as the Philadel-\nphia “cluster” or the Philadelphia “Designated Market\nArea” (DMA), includes 16 counties located in Pennsylvania,\nDelaware, and New Jersey.1 Petitioners pursued their\n——————\n  1 A “Designated Market Area” is a term used by Nielsen Media Re­\n\nsearch to define a broadcast-television market.

As a result of nine cluster-\ning transactions, petitioners’ share of subscribers in the re-\ngion allegedly increased from 23.9 percent in 1998 to 69.5\npercent in 2007. See 264 F. R. D. 150, 156, n. 8, 160 (ED\nPa. 2010).\n   The named plaintiffs, respondents here, are subscribers\nto Comcast’s cable-television services. They filed a class­\naction antitrust suit against petitioners, claiming that\npetitioners entered into unlawful swap agreements, in\nviolation of §1 of the Sherman Act, and monopolized or at-\ntempted to monopolize services in the cluster, in viola­\ntion of §2. Ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C.\n§§1, 2. Petitioners’ clustering scheme, respondents con­\ntended, harmed subscribers in the Philadelphia cluster by\neliminating competition and holding prices for cable ser­\nvices above competitive levels.\n   Respondents sought to certify a class under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). That provision permits\ncertification only if “the court finds that the questions of\nlaw or fact common to class members predominate over\nany questions affecting only individual members.” The\nDistrict Court held, and it is uncontested here, that to\nmeet the predominance requirement respondents had to\nshow (1) that the existence of individual injury resulting\nfrom the alleged antitrust violation (referred to as “anti­\ntrust impact”) was “capable of proof at trial through\nevidence that [was] common to the class rather than indi­\n—————— \n\nPhiladelphia DMA comprises 18 counties, not 16. \n\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

R. D., at\n154.2\n   Respondents proposed four theories of antitrust impact:\nFirst, Comcast’s clustering made it profitable for Comcast\nto withhold local sports programming from its competi­\ntors, resulting in decreased market penetration by direct\nbroadcast satellite providers. Second, Comcast’s activities\nreduced the level of competition from “overbuilders,” com­\npanies that build competing cable networks in areas\nwhere an incumbent cable company already operates.\nThird, Comcast reduced the level of “benchmark” competi­\ntion on which cable customers rely to compare prices.\nFourth, clustering increased Comcast’s bargaining power\nrelative to content providers. Each of these forms of im­\npact, respondents alleged, increased cable subscription\nrates throughout the Philadelphia DMA.\n   The District Court accepted the overbuilder theory of\nantitrust impact as capable of classwide proof and rejected\nthe rest. Id., at 165, 174, 178, 181. Accordingly, in its\ncertification order, the District Court limited respondents’\n“proof of antitrust impact” to “the theory that Comcast\nengaged in anticompetitive clustering conduct, the effect of\nwhich was to deter the entry of overbuilders in the Phila­\ndelphia DMA.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 192a–193a.3\n——————\n  2 Respondents    sought certification for the following class: “All cable\ntelevision customers who subscribe or subscribed at any times since\nDecember 1, 1999, to the present to video programming services (other\nthan solely to basic cable services) from Comcast, or any of its subsidi­\naries or affiliates in Comcast’s Philadelphia cluster.” App. 35a.\n   3 The District Court did not hold that the three alternative theories of\n\nliability failed to establish antitrust impact, but merely that those\ntheories could not be determined in a manner common to all the class\nplaintiffs. The other theories of liability may well be available for\nthe plaintiffs to pursue as individual actions. Any contention that the\nplaintiffs should be allowed to recover damages attributable to all four\n4                COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court further found that the damages\nresulting from overbuilder-deterrence impact could be\ncalculated on a classwide basis. To establish such dam-\nages, respondents had relied solely on the testimony of Dr.\nJames McClave. Dr. McClave designed a regression model\ncomparing actual cable prices in the Philadelphia DMA\nwith hypothetical prices that would have prevailed but\nfor petitioners’ allegedly anticompetitive activities. The\nmodel calculated damages of $875,576,662 for the entire\nclass. App. 1388a (sealed). As Dr. McClave acknowledged,\nhowever, the model did not isolate damages resulting\nfrom any one theory of antitrust impact. Id., at 189a–\n190a. The District Court nevertheless certified the class.\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. On\nappeal, petitioners contended the class was improperly\ncertified because the model, among other shortcomings,\nfailed to attribute damages resulting from overbuilder\ndeterrence, the only theory of injury remaining in the case.\nThe court refused to consider the argument because, in its\nview, such an “attac[k] on the merits of the methodology\n[had] no place in the class certification inquiry.” 655 F. 3d\n182, 207 (CA3 2011). The court emphasized that, “[a]t\nthe class certification stage,” respondents were not required\nto “tie each theory of antitrust impact to an exact calcula­\ntion of damages.” Id., at 206. According to the court, it\nhad “not reached the stage of determining on the merits\nwhether the methodology is a just and reasonable infer­\nence or speculative.” Ibid. Rather, the court said, re­\nspondents must “assure us that if they can prove antitrust\nimpact, the resulting damages are capable of measure­\nment and will not require labyrinthine individual calcula­\n\n——————\ntheories in this class action would erroneously suggest one of two\nthings—either that the plaintiffs may also recover such damages in\nindividual actions or that they are precluded from asserting those\ntheories in individual actions.\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

Wal-Mart\nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n10). The Rule “does not set forth a mere pleading stand­\nard.” Ibid. Rather, a party must not only “be prepared to\nprove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties,\ncommon questions of law or fact,” typicality of claims or\ndefenses, and adequacy of representation, as required by\nRule 23(a). Ibid. The party must also satisfy through\nevidentiary proof at least one of the provisions of Rule\n——————\n   4 The question presented reads: “Whether a district court may certify\n\na class action without resolving whether the plaintiff class had intro­\nduced admissible evidence, including expert testimony, to show that the\ncase is susceptible to awarding damages on a class-wide basis.” 567\nU. S., at ___. Respondents contend that petitioners forfeited their\nability to answer this question in the negative because they did not\nmake an objection to the admission of Dr. McClave’s testimony under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharma-\nceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579 (1993). Such a forfeit would make it\nimpossible for petitioners to argue that Dr. McClave’s testimony was\nnot “admissible evidence” under the Rules; but it does not make it\nimpossible for them to argue that the evidence failed “to show that the\ncase is susceptible to awarding damages on a class-wide basis.” Peti­\ntioners argued below, and continue to argue here, that certification was\nimproper because respondents had failed to establish that damages\ncould be measured on a classwide basis. That is the question we\naddress here.\n6                COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n23(b). The provision at issue here is Rule 23(b)(3), which\nrequires a court to find that “the questions of law or fact\ncommon to class members predominate over any questions\naffecting only individual members.”\n   Repeatedly, we have emphasized that it “ ‘may be neces­\nsary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before\ncoming to rest on the certification question,’ and that\ncertification is proper only if ‘the trial court is satisfied,\nafter a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule\n23(a) have been satisfied.’ ” Ibid. (quoting General Tele-\nphone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, 160–161\n(1982)). Such an analysis will frequently entail “overlap\nwith the merits of the plaintiff ’s underlying claim.” 564\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). That is so because the “ ‘class\ndetermination generally involves considerations that are\nenmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the\nplaintiff ’s cause of action.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Falcon, supra,\nat 160).\n   The same analytical principles govern Rule 23(b). If\nanything, Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance criterion is even\nmore demanding than Rule 23(a). Amchem Products, Inc.\nv. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 623–624 (1997). Rule 23(b)(3),\nas an “ ‘adventuresome innovation,’ ” is designed for situa­\ntions “ ‘in which “class-action treatment is not as clearly\ncalled for.” ’ ” Wal-Mart, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 22)\n(quoting Amchem, 521 U. S., at 614–615). That explains\nCongress’s addition of procedural safeguards for (b)(3)\nclass members beyond those provided for (b)(1) or (b)(2)\nclass members (e.g., an opportunity to opt out), and the\ncourt’s duty to take a “ ‘close look’ ” at whether common\nquestions predominate over individual ones. Id., at 615.\n                           III\n  Respondents’ class action was improperly certified un­\nder Rule 23(b)(3). By refusing to entertain arguments\nagainst respondents’ damages model that bore on the\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npropriety of class certification, simply because those ar­\nguments would also be pertinent to the merits determina­\ntion, the Court of Appeals ran afoul of our precedents\nrequiring precisely that inquiry. And it is clear that,\nunder the proper standard for evaluating certification,\nrespondents’ model falls far short of establishing that\ndamages are capable of measurement on a classwide basis.\nWithout presenting another methodology, respondents\ncannot show Rule 23(b)(3) predominance: Questions of\nindividual damage calculations will inevitably overwhelm\nquestions common to the class. This case thus turns on\nthe straightforward application of class-certification prin­\nciples; it provides no occasion for the dissent’s extended\ndiscussion, post, at 5–11 (GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ.,\ndissenting), of substantive antitrust law.\n                              A\n   We start with an unremarkable premise. If respondents\nprevail on their claims, they would be entitled only to\ndamages resulting from reduced overbuilder competition,\nsince that is the only theory of antitrust impact accepted\nfor class-action treatment by the District Court. It follows\nthat a model purporting to serve as evidence of damages in\nthis class action must measure only those damages at­\ntributable to that theory. If the model does not even at­\ntempt to do that, it cannot possibly establish that damages\nare susceptible of measurement across the entire class for\npurposes of Rule 23(b)(3). Calculations need not be exact,\nsee Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co.,\n282 U. S. 555, 563 (1931), but at the class-certification\nstage (as at trial), any model supporting a “plaintiff ’s\ndamages case must be consistent with its liability case,\nparticularly with respect to the alleged anticompetitive\neffect of the violation.” ABA Section of Antitrust Law,\nProving Antitrust Damages: Legal and Economic Issues\n57, 62 (2d ed. 2010); see, e.g., Image Tech. Servs. v. East-\n8                   COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nman Kodak Co., 125 F. 3d 1195, 1224 (CA9 1997). And for\npurposes of Rule 23, courts must conduct a “ ‘rigorous\nanalysis’ ” to determine whether that is so. Wal-Mart,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n  The District Court and the Court of Appeals saw no\nneed for respondents to “tie each theory of antitrust im­\npact” to a calculation of damages. 655 F. 3d, at 206. That,\nthey said, would involve consideration of the “merits”\nhaving “no place in the class certification inquiry.” Id.,\nat 206–207. That reasoning flatly contradicts our cases\nrequiring a determination that Rule 23 is satisfied, even\nwhen that requires inquiry into the merits of the claim.\nWal-Mart, supra, at ___, and n. 6 (slip op., at 10–11, and\nn. 6). The Court of Appeals simply concluded that re­\nspondents “provided a method to measure and quantify\ndamages on a classwide basis,” finding it unnecessary to\ndecide “whether the methodology [was] a just and reason­\nable inference or speculative.” 655 F. 3d, at 206. Under\nthat logic, at the class-certification stage any method of\nmeasurement is acceptable so long as it can be applied\nclasswide, no matter how arbitrary the measurements\nmay be. Such a proposition would reduce Rule 23(b)(3)’s\npredominance requirement to a nullity.\n                              B\n  There is no question that the model failed to measure\ndamages resulting from the particular antitrust injury\non which petitioners’ liability in this action is premised.5\n——————\n  5 The dissent is of the view that what an econometric model proves is\n\na “question of fact” on which we will not “undertake to review concur­\nrent findings . . . by two courts below in the absence of a very obvious\nand exceptional showing of error.” Post, at 9 (quoting United States v.\nVirginia, 518 U. S. 515, 589, n. 5 (1996) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (inter­\nnal quotation marks omitted)). To begin with, neither of the courts\nbelow found that the model established damages attributable to over­\nbuilding alone. Second, while the data contained within an econometric\nmodel may well be “questions of fact” in the relevant sense, what those\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nThe scheme devised by respondents’ expert, Dr. McClave,\nsought to establish a “but for” baseline—a figure that\nwould show what the competitive prices would have been\nif there had been no antitrust violations. Damages would\nthen be determined by comparing to that baseline what\nthe actual prices were during the charged period. The\n“but for” figure was calculated, however, by assuming a\nmarket that contained none of the four distortions that\nrespondents attributed to petitioners’ actions. In other\nwords, the model assumed the validity of all four theories\nof antitrust impact initially advanced by respondents:\ndecreased penetration by satellite providers, overbuilder\ndeterrence, lack of benchmark competition, and increased\nbargaining power.      At the evidentiary hearing, Dr.\nMcClave expressly admitted that the model calculated\ndamages resulting from “the alleged anticompetitive\nconduct as a whole” and did not attribute damages to\nany one particular theory of anticompetitive impact.

But as Judge\nJordan’s partial dissent pointed out:\n     “[B]ecause the only surviving theory of antitrust im­\n     pact is that clustering reduced overbuilding, for Dr.\n     McClave’s comparison to be relevant, his benchmark\n     counties must reflect the conditions that would have\n     prevailed in the Philadelphia DMA but for the alleged\n     reduction in overbuilding.

But such assurance\nis not provided by a methodology that identifies damages\nthat are not the result of the wrong. For all we know,\ncable subscribers in Gloucester County may have been\novercharged because of petitioners’ alleged elimination of\nsatellite competition (a theory of liability that is not ca-\npable of classwide proof ); while subscribers in Camden\nCounty may have paid elevated prices because of petitioners’\nincreased bargaining power vis-à-vis content providers\n(another theory that is not capable of classwide proof );\nwhile yet other subscribers in Montgomery County may\nhave paid rates produced by the combined effects of multi­\nple forms of alleged antitrust harm; and so on. The per­\nmutations involving four theories of liability and 2 million\nsubscribers located in 16 counties are nearly endless.\n   In light of the model’s inability to bridge the differences\nbetween supra-competitive prices in general and supra­\ncompetitive prices attributable to the deterrence of over­\nbuilding, Rule 23(b)(3) cannot authorize treating subscrib­\ners within the Philadelphia cluster as members of a single\nclass.6 Prices whose level above what an expert deems\n——————\n  6 We might add that even if the model had identified subscribers who\n\npaid more solely because of the deterrence of overbuilding, it still would\nnot have established the requisite commonality of damages unless it\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

On both procedural and substantive\ngrounds, we dissent.\n                              I\n   This case comes to the Court infected by our misguided\nreformulation of the question presented. For that reason\nalone, we would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvi­\ndently granted.\n   Comcast sought review of the following question:\n“[W]hether a district court may certify a class action with­\nout resolving ‘merits arguments’ that bear on [Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure] 23’s prerequisites for certifica­\ntion, including whether purportedly common issues pre­\ndominate over individual ones under Rule 23(b)(3).” Pet.\nfor Cert. i. We granted review of a different question:\n“Whether a district court may certify a class action with­\nout resolving whether the plaintiff class has introduced\nadmissible evidence, including expert testimony, to show\nthat the case is susceptible to awarding damages on a\nclass-wide basis.” 567 U. S. ___ (2012) (emphasis added).\n   Our rephrasing shifted the focus of the dispute from the\nDistrict Court’s Rule 23(b)(3) analysis to its attention (or\n2               COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nlack thereof) to the admissibility of expert testimony. The\nparties, responsively, devoted much of their briefing to the\nquestion whether the standards for admissibility of expert\nevidence set out in Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and\nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S.\n579 (1993), apply in class certification proceedings. See\nBrief for Petitioners 35–49; Brief for Respondents 24–37.\nIndeed, respondents confirmed at oral argument that they\nunderstood our rewritten question to center on admissibil­\nity, not Rule 23(b)(3). See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 25.\n   As it turns out, our reformulated question was inapt. To\npreserve a claim of error in the admission of evidence, a\nparty must timely object to or move to strike the evidence.\nFed. Rule Evid. 103(a)(1). In the months preceding the\nDistrict Court’s class certification order, Comcast did not\nobject to the admission of Dr. McClave’s damages model\nunder Rule 702 or Daubert. Nor did Comcast move to\nstrike his testimony and expert report. Consequently,\nComcast forfeited any objection to the admission of Dr.\nMcClave’s model at the certification stage. At this late\ndate, Comcast may no longer argue that respondents’\ndamages evidence was inadmissible.\n   Comcast’s forfeiture of the question on which we granted\nreview is reason enough to dismiss the writ as improvi­\ndently granted. See Rogers v. United States, 522 U. S.\n252, 259 (1998) (O’Connor, J., concurring in result) (“[W]e\nought not to decide the question if it has not been cleanly\npresented.”); The Monrosa v. Carbon Black Export, Inc.,\n359 U. S. 180, 183 (1959) (dismissal appropriate in light\nof “circumstances . . . not fully apprehended at the time\ncertiorari was granted” (internal quotation marks omit­\nted)). The Court, however, elects to evaluate whether re­\nspondents “failed to show that the case is susceptible to\nawarding damages on a class-wide basis.” Ante, at 5, n. 4\n(internal quotation marks omitted). To justify this second\nrevision of the question presented, the Court observes that\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nComcast “argued below, and continue[s] to argue here,\nthat certification was improper because respondents had\nfailed to establish that damages could be measured on a\nclasswide basis.” Ibid. And so Comcast did, in addition to\nendeavoring to address the question on which we granted\nreview. By treating the first part of our reformulated\nquestion as though it did not exist, the Court is hardly fair\nto respondents.\n  Abandoning the question we instructed the parties to\nbrief does “not reflect well on the processes of the Court.”\nRedrup v. New York, 386 U. S. 767, 772 (1967) (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting). Taking their cue from our order, respondents\ndid not train their energies on defending the District\nCourt’s finding of predominance in their briefing or at oral\nargument. The Court’s newly revised question, focused on\npredominance, phrased only after briefing was done, left\nrespondents without an unclouded opportunity to air the\nissue the Court today decides against them. And by re­\nsolving a complex and fact-intensive question without the\nbenefit of full briefing, the Court invites the error into\nwhich it has fallen. See infra, at 5–11.\n                              II\n   While the Court’s decision to review the merits of the\nDistrict Court’s certification order is both unwise and un­\nfair to respondents, the opinion breaks no new ground on\nthe standard for certifying a class action under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). In particular, the deci­\nsion should not be read to require, as a prerequisite to\ncertification, that damages attributable to a classwide\ninjury be measurable “ ‘on a class-wide basis.’ ” See ante,\nat 2–3 (acknowledging Court’s dependence on the absence\nof contest on the matter in this case); Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.\n   To gain class-action certification under Rule 23(b)(3),\nthe named plaintiff must demonstrate, and the District\nCourt must find, “that the questions of law or fact common\n4                  COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n                 GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nto class members predominate over any questions affect­\ning only individual members.” This predominance re­\nquirement is meant to “tes[t] whether proposed classes are\nsufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by represen­\ntation,” Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591,\n623 (1997), but it scarcely demands commonality as to all\nquestions. See 7AA C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane,\nFederal Practice and Procedure §1778, p. 121 (3d ed. 2005)\n(hereinafter Wright, Miller, & Kane). In particular, when\nadjudication of questions of liability common to the class\nwill achieve economies of time and expense, the predomi­\nnance standard is generally satisfied even if damages are\nnot provable in the aggregate. See Advisory Committee’s\n1966 Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U. S. C. App.,\np. 141 (“[A] fraud perpetrated on numerous persons by\nthe use of similar misrepresentations may be an appealing\nsituation for a class action, and it may remain so despite\nthe need, if liability is found, for separate determination of\nthe damages suffered by individuals within the class.”);\n7AA Wright, Miller, & Kane §1781, at 235–237.*\n   Recognition that individual damages calculations do not\npreclude class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is well nigh\nuniversal. See 2 W. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Ac­\ntions §4:54, p. 205 (5th ed. 2012) (ordinarily, “individual\ndamage[s] calculations should not scuttle class certifica­\ntion under Rule 23(b)(3)”). Legions of appellate decisions\nacross a range of substantive claims are illustrative. See,\ne.g., Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F. 3d 1, 6 (CA1 2004)\n(Fourth Amendment); Chiang v.

As\nthis Court has rightly observed, “[p]redominance is a test\nreadily met” in actions alleging “violations of the antitrust\nlaws.” Amchem, 521 U.

And in doing so, it relies on its own version\nof the facts, a version inconsistent with factual findings\nmade by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of\nAppeals.\n6               COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\n                              A\n   To understand the antitrust problem, some (simplified)\nbackground discussion is necessary. Plaintiffs below, re­\nspondents here, alleged that Comcast violated §§1 and 2\nof the Sherman Act. See 15 U. S. C. §§1, 2. For present\npurposes, the §2 claim provides the better illustration. A\nfirm is guilty of monopolization under §2 if the plaintiff\nproves (1) “the possession of monopoly power in the rele­\nvant market” and (2) “the willful acquisition or mainte­\nnance of that power[,] as distinguished from growth or\ndevelopment as a consequence of a superior product, busi­\nness acumen, or historic accident.” United States v.\nGrinnell Corp., 384 U. S. 563, 570–571 (1966). A private\nplaintiff seeking damages must also show that (3) the\nmonopolization caused “injur[y].” 15 U. S. C. §15. We\nhave said that antitrust injuries must be “of the type the\nantitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flo[w]\nfrom that which makes defendants’ acts unlawful.” Atlan-\ntic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U. S. 328, 334\n(1990) (quoting Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat,\nInc., 429 U. S. 477, 489 (1977)). See 2A Areeda & Ho­\nvenkamp ¶391a, at 320 (To prove antitrust injury, “[a]\nprivate plaintiff must identify the economic rationale for a\nbusiness practice’s illegality under the antitrust laws and\nshow that its harm flows from whatever it is that makes\nthe practice unlawful.”).\n   As plaintiffs below, respondents attempted to meet\nthese requirements by showing that (1) Comcast obtained\na 60% or greater share of the Philadelphia market, and\nthat its share provides it with monopoly power; (2) Com­\ncast acquired its share through exclusionary conduct\nconsisting of a series of mergers with competitors and\n“swaps” of customers and locations; and (3) Comcast con­\nsequently injured respondents by charging them supra­\ncompetitive prices.\n   If, as respondents contend, Philadelphia is a separate\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

A market, such as the one alleged by\nrespondents, where one firm controls 60% is far worse.\nSee id., §5.3, at 18–19, and n. 9 (using a concentration\nindex that determines a market’s concentration level by\nsumming the squares of each firm’s market share, one\nfirm with 100% yielding 10,000, five firms with 20% each\nyielding 2000, while a market where one firm accounts for\n60% yields an index number of at least 3,600). The Guide­\nlines, and any standard antitrust treatise, explain why\nfirms in highly concentrated markets normally have the\npower to raise prices significantly above competitive lev­\nels. See, e.g., 2B Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶503, at 115.\n                              B\n   So far there is agreement. But consider the last matter\nrespondents must prove: Can they show that Comcast\ninjured them by charging higher prices? After all, a firm\nwith monopoly power will not necessarily exercise that\npower by charging higher prices. It could instead act less\ncompetitively in other ways, such as by leading the quiet\nlife. See J. Hicks, Annual Survey of Economic Theory: The\nTheory of Monopoly, 3 Econometrica 1, 8 (1935) (“The best\nof all monopoly profits is a quiet life.”).\n   It is at this point that Dr. McClave’s model enters the\nscene. His model first selects a group of comparable\noutside-Philadelphia “benchmark” counties, where Comcast\nenjoyed a lower market share (and where satellite broad­\ncasting accounted for more of the local business). Using\nmultiple regression analysis, McClave’s model measures\n8               COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nthe effect of the anticompetitive conduct by comparing\nthe class counties to the benchmark counties. The model\nconcludes that the prices Philadelphia area consumers\nwould have paid had the Philadelphia counties shared\nthe properties of the benchmark counties (including a\ndiminished Comcast market share), would have been\n13.1% lower than those they actually paid. Thus, the model\nprovides evidence that Comcast’s anticompetitive conduct,\nwhich led to a 60% market share, caused the class to\nsuffer injuriously higher prices.\n                              C\n                              1\n   The special antitrust-related difficulty present here\nstems from the manner in which respondents attempted\nto prove their antitrust injuries. They proffered four\n“non-exclusive mechanisms” that allegedly “cause[d] the\nhigh prices” in the Philadelphia area. App. 403a. Those four\ntheories posit that (1) due to Comcast’s acquisitions of\ncompetitors, customers found it more difficult to compare\nprices; (2) one set of potential competitors, namely Direct\nBroadcast Satellite companies, found it more difficult to\nobtain access to local sports broadcasts and consequently\ndecided not to enter the Philadelphia market; (3) Com­\ncast’s ability to obtain programming material at lower\nprices permitted it to raise prices; and (4) a number of\npotential competitors (called “overbuilders”), whose pres­\nence in the market would have limited Comcast’s power to\nraise prices, were ready to enter some parts of the market\nbut decided not to do so in light of Comcast’s anticompeti­\ntive conduct. 264 F. R. D. 150, 161–162 (ED Pa. 2010).\n   For reasons not here relevant, the District Court found\nthe first three theories inapplicable and limited the\nliability-phase proof to the “overbuilder” theory. See App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 192a–193a. It then asked the parties to\nbrief whether doing so had any impact on the viability of\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nMcClave’s model as a measure of classwide damages. See\n264 F. R. D., at 190. After considering the parties’ argu­\nments, the District Court found that striking the three\ntheories “does not impeach Dr. McClave’s damages model”\nbecause “[a]ny anticompetitive conduct is reflected in the\n[higher Philadelphia] price [which Dr. McClave’s model\ndetermines], not in the [the model’s] selection of the\ncomparison counties, [i.e., the lower-price ‘benchmark\ncounties’ with which the Philadelphia area prices were\ncompared].” Id., at 190–191. The court explained that\n“whether or not we accepted all [four] . . . theories . . . is\ninapposite to Dr. McClave’s methods of choosing bench­\nmarks.” Ibid. On appeal, the Third Circuit held that this\nfinding was not an abuse of discretion. 655 F. 3d 182, 207\n(2011).\n                              2\n   The Court, however, concludes that “the model failed to\nmeasure damages resulting from the particular antitrust\ninjury on which petitioners’ liability in this action is prem­\nised.” Ante, at 8. To reach this conclusion the Court must\nconsider fact-based matters, namely what this econometric\nmultiple-regression model is about, what it proves, and\nhow it does so. And it must overturn two lower courts’\nrelated factual findings to the contrary.\n   We are normally “reluctant to disturb findings of fact in\nwhich two courts below have concurred.” United States v.\nDoe, 465 U. S. 605, 614 (1984). See also United States v.\nVirginia, 518 U. S. 515, 589, n. 5 (1996) (SCALIA, J., dis­\nsenting) (noting “our well-settled rule that we will not\n‘undertake to review concurrent findings of fact by two\ncourts below in the absence of a very obvious and excep­\ntional showing of error’ ” (quoting Graver Tank & Mfg. Co.\nv. Linde Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271, 275 (1949))).\nHere, the District Court found McClave’s econometric\nmodel capable of measuring damages on a classwide basis,\n10              COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\neven after striking three of the injury theories. 264\nF. R. D., at 190–191. Contrary to the Court’s characteriza­\ntion, see ante, at 8–9, n. 5, this was not a legal conclusion\nabout what the model proved; it was a factual finding\nabout how the model worked. Under our typical practice,\nwe should leave that finding alone.\n   In any event, as far as we can tell, the lower courts were\nright. On the basis of the record as we understand it, the\nDistrict Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that\nMcClave’s model could measure damages suffered by the\nclass—even if the damages were limited to those caused by\ndeterred overbuilding. That is because respondents al­\nleged that Comcast’s anticompetitive conduct increased\nComcast’s market share (and market power) by deterring\npotential entrants, in particular, overbuilders, from enter­\ning the Philadelphia area market. See App. 43a–66a. By\nshowing that this was so, respondents’ proof tends to show\nthe same in respect to other entrants. The overbuilders’\nfailure to enter deprives the market of the price discipline\nthat their entry would have provided in other parts via\nthreat of the overbuilders’ expansion or that of others\npotentially led on by their example. Indeed, in the District\nCourt, Comcast argued that the three other theories,\ni.e., the three rejected theories, had no impact on prices.\nSee 264 F. R. D., at 166, 176, 180–181. If Comcast was\nright, then the damages McClave’s model found must\nhave stemmed exclusively from conduct that deterred new\nentry, say from “overbuilders.” Not surprisingly, the\nCourt offers no support at all for its contrary conclusion,\nnamely, that the District Court’s finding was “ ‘obvious[ly]\nand exceptional[ly]’ erroneous.” Ante, at 8–9, n. 5 (quoting\nVirginia, 518 U. S., at 589, n. 5 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)).\n   We are particularly concerned about the matter because\nthe Court, in reaching its contrary conclusion, makes\nbroad statements about antitrust law that it could not\nmean to apply in other cases. The Court begins with what\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n              GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nit calls an “unremarkable premise” that respondents could\nbe “entitled only to damages resulting from reduced over­\nbuilder competition.” Ante, at 7. In most §2 cases, how­\never, the Court’s starting place would seem remarkable, not\n“unremarkable.”\n   Suppose in a different case a plaintiff were to prove that\nWidget, Inc. has obtained, through anticompetitive means,\na 90% share of the California widget market. Suppose the\nplaintiff also proves that the two small remaining firms—\none in Ukiah, the other in San Diego—lack the capacity to\nexpand their widget output to the point where that pos­\nsibility could deter Widget, Inc. from raising its prices.\nSuppose further that the plaintiff introduces a model that\nshows California widget prices are now twice those in\nevery other State, which, the model concludes is (after\naccounting for other possible reasons) the result of lack of\ncompetition in the California widget market. Why would a\ncourt hearing that case restrict damages solely to custom­\ners in the vicinity of Ukiah and San Diego?\n   Like the model in this example, Dr. McClave’s model\ndoes not purport to show precisely how Comcast’s conduct\nled to higher prices in the Philadelphia area. It simply\nshows that Comcast’s conduct brought about higher prices.\nAnd it measures the amount of subsequent harm.\n                        *    *     *\n  Because the parties did not fully argue the question the\nCourt now answers, all Members of the Court may lack a\ncomplete understanding of the model or the meaning of\nrelated statements in the record. The need for focused\nargument is particularly strong here where, as we have\nsaid, the underlying considerations are detailed, technical,\nand fact-based. The Court departs from our ordinary\npractice, risks inaccurate judicial decisionmaking, and is\nunfair to respondents and the courts below. For these rea­\nsons, we would not disturb the Court of Appeals’ judgment\n12            COMCAST CORP. v. BEHREND\n\n            GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ., dissenting\n\nand, instead, would dismiss the writ as improvidently\ngranted.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/856346/", "sha1": "7e2e1ede1dec7cf72552ebc89a9cef56b50ac21a", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2013-03-27T07:19:14.293230"}
