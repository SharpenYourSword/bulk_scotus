The premise of that question is\nthat a breakdown in Louisiana’s system for paying the\nattorneys representing petitioner, an indigent defendant\nwho was charged with a capital offense, caused most of\nthe lengthy delay between his arrest and trial. Because the\nrecord shows otherwise, I agree that the writ of certiorari\nwas improvidently granted.\n   In February 2002, petitioner and his brother were\nhitchhiking in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. Petitioner\nrobbed and murdered a driver who picked them up. After\nenlisting his brother to help him cover up the crime, peti-\ntioner fled to Florida, where he was captured about a\nmonth later. The evidence of petitioner’s guilt was over-\nwhelming. He gave the police a detailed statement de-\nscribing the murder; his brother, an eyewitness, agreed to\ntestify about the crime; multiple other members of peti-\ntioner’s family told police that they had heard petitioner\nconfess; and petitioner’s fingerprints were found in the\n2                   BOYER v. LOUISIANA\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nvictim’s truck.\n   Louisiana prosecutors announced that they would seek\nthe death penalty, and the state court appointed Thomas\nLorenzi, an experienced trial attorney, to serve as peti-\ntioner’s primary defense counsel. For the next five years,\nMr. Lorenzi led petitioner’s defense, but he was assisted at\nall times by at least one highly credentialed but less expe-\nrienced attorney from the Louisiana Capital Assistance\nCenter (LCAC).\n   The attorneys from the LCAC were paid by the State,\nbut there was confusion about which branch of the state\ngovernment was responsible for paying Mr. Lorenzi’s fees.\nThe trial court promptly scheduled a hearing on that pre-\nliminary matter, but the hearing was repeatedly put off\nat the urging of the defense. Over the course of more\nthan three years, the defense requested that the hearing\nbe continued on eight separate occasions, causing a total\ndelay of approximately 20 months. The trial court also\nissued several other continuances without any objection\nfrom the defense, delaying the hearing an additional 15\nmonths. And just when it seemed that the hearing would\nfinally be held, Hurricane Rita forced the Calcasieu Parish\nCourthouse to close.\n   The trial court held the hearing on March 27, 2006, and\nat that time it became clear that Mr. Lorenzi’s fees could\nnot be fully paid until the start of the next fiscal year. Ten\nmonths later, the State broke the resulting impasse by\nannouncing that it would no longer seek the death pen-\nalty. That greatly reduced the complexity and cost of peti-\ntioner’s defense and allowed his case to proceed. Mr.\nLorenzi withdrew, and attorneys from the LCAC accepted\nthe role of lead counsel.\n   From that point, the case proceeded at a plodding pace.\nPetitioner filed voluminous pretrial motions, took multiple\ninterlocutory appeals, and twice demanded the recusal of\nthe trial judge. The trial court halted proceedings for 11\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

At last, despite petitioner’s\ncontention that he needed still more time to prepare, the\ntrial began on September 22, 2009. A jury found peti-\ntioner guilty of second-degree murder and armed robbery.\n   In sum, the record shows that the single largest share\nof the delay in this case was the direct result of defense\nrequests for continuances, that other defense motions\ncaused substantial additional delay, and that much of the\nrest of the delay was caused by events beyond anyone’s\ncontrol. It is also quite clear that the delay caused by the\ndefense likely worked in petitioner’s favor. The state court\nobserved that petitioner’s assertions of his speedy trial\nright were “more perfunctory than aggressive.” 2010–693,\np. 34 (La.

And\nwhat started out as a very strong case of first-degree\nmurder ended up, after much delay, in a conviction for\nlesser offenses.\n   The dissent would ignore what the record plainly shows\nbased largely on the Louisiana Court of Appeals’ obser-\nvation that “[t]he majority of the seven-year delay was\ncaused by the ‘lack of funding.’ ” Id., at 1142. See post, at\n5, 8 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But when this statement\nis read in context, what it most likely means is not that\nthe delay in question was caused by the State’s failure to\nprovide funding but simply that the delay was attributable\nto the funding issue. And as noted, most of this delay was\ncaused by the many defense requests for continuances of\nhearings on the issue of funding. If the defense had not\nsought and obtained those continuances, the trial might\nwell have commenced at a much earlier date—and might\nhave reached a conclusion far less favorable to the\ndefense.*\n——————\n  * The dissent also claims that “Louisiana conceded below that most of\nthe delay resulted from the lack of funding for Boyer’s defense.” Post,\n4                        BOYER v.

But the dissent’s only citation is to the State’s\nargument in the alternative that even if the legislature’s failure to\nappropriate funds for the defense caused the delay, that delay should\nnot count against the prosecution for purposes of Louisiana’s statutory\nspeedy trial requirement. The State in no way conceded that it caused\nthe delay in this case. Indeed, the very next paragraph of the State’s\nbrief argued that “the defendant sought to delay the inception of his\ntrial via his funding motion.” App. 317a.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Nevertheless, the court did\nnot weigh that part of the delay against the State in as-\nsessing the merits of Boyer’s claim, reasoning that it was\n“ ‘out of the State’s control.’ ” Id., at 1145.\n    We granted certiorari to decide whether a delay caused\nby a State’s failure to fund counsel for an indigent’s de-\nfense should be weighed against the State in determining\nwhether there was a deprivation of a defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment right to a speedy trial. 568 U. S. ___ (2012).\nRather than dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, I\nwould simply address this question. Our precedents pro-\nvide a clear answer: Such a delay should weigh against the\nState. It is important for States to understand that they\nhave an obligation to protect a defendant’s constitutional\nright to a speedy trial. I respectfully dissent.\n2                       BOYER v. LOUISIANA\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                              I\n  The decision below describes the facts as follows. On\nFebruary 4, 2002, Boyer and his brother were walking by\nthe side of the road in Sulphur, Louisiana. Bradlee Marsh\nstopped his truck and gave the two men a ride. Once\ninside the truck, Boyer demanded money. When Marsh\nrefused, Boyer shot him three times in the head and then\ntook some cash and a silver chain from his person. Marsh\neventually died of his wounds. On March, 8, 2002, Boyer\nwas arrested in Jacksonville, Florida, and was indicted\nin Louisiana for first-degree murder on June 6, 2002, in\nviolation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §14:30 (West 1997). Loui-\nsiana sought the death penalty.\n  Boyer filed a motion to determine the source of funds for\nhis defense in November 2002. A hearing on the motion\nwas held on August 15, 2003, which was continued until a\nlater date. From that point on, “the only matters that\ncame before the trial court concerned the source of fund-\ning.” 56 So. 3d, at 1142. Boyer and the State filed numer-\nous continuances over the next two years that further\npostponed the funding hearing.\n  On July 7, 2005, Boyer filed a motion to quash the in-\ndictment as a violation of his right to a speedy trial under\nthe Louisiana Constitution, the State’s speedy trial stat-\nute, and the Sixth Amendment.1 This hearing was itself\npostponed. Among other things, disruptions caused by\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita resulted in further delay.\nWhen a hearing on the motion to quash was finally held,\ndefense counsel moved to dismiss Boyer’s federal speedy\n——————\n   1 Under the relevant statute, “no trial shall be commenced . . . [i]n\n\ncapital cases after three years from the date of the institution of the\nprosecution.” La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 578(1) (West 2003). The\ntrial court may dismiss the indictment upon the expiration of the 3-year\nperiod. See Art. 581. Boyer brought this motion to quash soon after\nthe limitations period under the statute had elapsed. See 56 So. 3d, at\n1142.\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

It concluded that under Louisiana’s speedy\ntrial statute, such delays could not be attributed to the\nprosecution because they were “beyond [its] control” and\nrested instead with the “legislature.” App. 703a. The\nLouisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed. 56 So.\n3d, at 1142.\n   On May 21, 2007, Louisiana amended the indictment to\nreduce the charge to second-degree murder, which is a\nnoncapital offense. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §14:30.1(B)\n(West 1997). The same day, the State filed a bill of infor-\nmation charging Boyer with armed robbery with a fire-\narm, a violation of §14:64.\n   On January 22, 2008, Boyer filed a second motion to\nquash the indictment and bill of information on the\ngrounds that the pretrial delay violated his right to a\nspeedy trial under the Louisiana Constitution and the\nSixth Amendment. The trial court denied the motion. On\nJuly 19, 2008, the court found Boyer incompetent to stand\ntrial, but later found his competency restored on April 15,\n2009. A trial commenced on September 22, 2009, more\nthan seven years after Boyer’s arrest. A week later, the\njury entered a verdict finding Boyer guilty of second-\ndegree murder and armed robbery.\n   The Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed\nBoyer’s conviction, finding, as relevant here, that there\nhad been no violation of Boyer’s right to a speedy trial\nunder the Sixth Amendment. 56 So. 3d, at 1139–1145.\nApplying our decision in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514\n(1972), the court recognized that the more than seven\nyears from the date of arrest to trial was “presumptively\n——————\n   2 Boyer’s counsel moved to dismiss the constitutional claim because\n\nhe lacked the “resources . . . to be able to prove prejudice [in] an eviden-\ntiary hearing.” App. 688a.\n4                    BOYER v. LOUISIANA\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nprejudicial.” 56 So. 3d, at 1144. It then went on to consider\nthe reason for the delay, and found that the “majority of\nthe . . . delay was caused by the ‘lack of funding’ ” for Boy-\ner’s defense. Id., at 1142.\n   The court, however, declined to weigh this period of the\ndelay against the State at all for the purposes of its analy-\nsis under Barker. 56 So. 3d, at 1145. It found that “[t]he\nfirst three years he was incarcerated, [while Boyer] was\ncharged with first degree murder . . . the progression of\nthe prosecution was ‘out of the State’s control.’ ” Ibid.\n(emphasis added). The Louisiana Supreme Court denied\nreview. 2011–0769 (La. 1/20/12), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 139.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n    The Sixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy\n. . . trial.” In Barker, we explained that whether there has\nbeen a violation of a defendant’s right to a speedy trial\nturns on a balancing test that “compels courts to approach\nspeedy trial cases on an ad hoc basis.” 407 U. S., at 530.\nWe identified four factors that courts should consider as\npart of that inquiry. These include the “[l]ength of delay,\nthe reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his\nright, and prejudice to the defendant.” Ibid.\n    While each of the factors is relevant, “[t]he flag all liti-\ngants seek to capture is the second factor, the reason for\ndelay.” United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 315\n(1986). We have explained that “different weights should\nbe assigned to different reasons.” Barker, 407 U. S., at\n531. “A deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to\nhamper the defense” is particularly serious, and “should\nbe weighted heavily against the government.” Ibid. “A\nmore neutral reason such as negligence or overcrowded\ncourts should be weighted less heavily but nevertheless\nshould be considered since the ultimate responsibility for\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

At the other end of the\nspectrum, “a valid reason, such as a missing witness,\nshould serve to justify appropriate delay.” Ibid.\n                              B\n  The Louisiana court found that the “majority of the\nseven-year delay” in Boyer’s case was caused by the “ ‘lack\nof funding’ ” made available for the defense, see 56 So. 3d,\nat 1142, and I defer to that factual determination, see\nHernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 366 (1991) (plurality\nopinion).3 The question is whether, once the Louisiana\ncourt found that most of the delay in Boyer’s case was\ncaused by the State’s failure to fund Boyer’s defense, the\ncourt was required to weigh that period of the delay\nagainst the State for the purposes of its analysis under\nBarker. The court’s conclusion that for the first three\nyears of Boyer’s case, the “progression of the prosecution\nwas ‘out of the State’s control’ ” makes clear that it did not.\n56 So. 3d, at 1145.\n  Our reasoning in Barker, however, requires that a delay\ncaused by a State’s failure to provide funding for an indi-\ngent’s defense must count against the State, and not the\naccused. As noted, we held there that even a more “neu-\ntral reason” for a delay such as “overcrowded courts”\nshould be weighed against the State, because “the ulti-\nmate responsibility for such circumstances” lies squarely\nwith the state system as a whole. 407 U. S., at 531. Ap-\n\n——————\n  3 Louisiana  previously conceded that the delay was caused by a lack\nof funding. See Brief in Opposition to Defendant’s Writ Application in\nNo. KW–07–00085 (La. App. 3 Cir.), App. 317a (“In this case, because\nthe defendant was without properly funded counsel for so long, the\nState simply could not ethically or legally bring him to trial. The in-\ndigent defense representation and funding situation is beyond the\nability of the State to control”); see also Brief for Louisiana in No. KA–\n10–693 etc. (La. App. 3 Cir.), App. 198a (same).\n6                   BOYER v. LOUISIANA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nplying similar logic, we recently indicated that “[d]elay\nresulting from a systemic breakdown in the public defender\nsystem, could be charged to the State” as well. Vermont v.\nBrillon, 556 U. S. 81, 94 (2009) (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n   A State’s failure to provide adequate funding for an\nindigent’s defense that prevents a case from going to trial\nis no different. Where a State has failed to provide fund-\ning for the defense and that lack of funding causes a delay,\nthe defendant cannot reasonably be faulted. See Barker,\n407 U. S., at 531. Placing the consequences of such a\ndelay squarely on the State’s shoulders is proper for the\nsimple reason that an indigent defendant has no control\nover whether a State has set aside funds to pay his lawyer\nor fund any necessary investigation. The failure to fund\nan indigent’s defense is not as serious as a deliberate\neffort by a State to cause delay. Ibid. But States routinely\nmake tradeoffs in the allocation of limited resources, and\nit is reasonable that a State bear the consequences of\nthese choices.\n   The Louisiana court’s analysis under Barker was there-\nfore based on a critical misapprehension of our precedents:\nIt did not attribute responsibility for the delay to the\nState, and thus incorrectly applied the factor that we have\nfound to be especially significant. See Loud Hawk, 474\nU. S., at 315. We have explained that, in every case,\n“courts must still engage in a difficult and sensitive bal-\nancing process,” and “none of the four factors [is] either a\nnecessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a depri-\nvation of the right of speedy trial.” Barker, 407 U. S., at\n533. Because the Barker factors must be viewed collec-\ntively, this error could very well have affected the out-\ncome. “[T]he balance arrived at in close cases ordinarily\nwould not prompt this Court’s review,” but the Louisiana\ncourt’s misattribution of the reason for the delay was a\n“fundamental error . . . that calls for this Court’s correc-\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntion.” Brillon, 556 U. S., at 91.\n   Our precedents therefore point the way to a straight-\nforward resolution of this case. I take no view as to how\nthe other elements of the Barker inquiry should be weighed,\nor the ultimate issue whether the delay violated Boyer’s\nright to a speedy trial. Instead, I would decide only\nthe narrow question on which we granted certiorari and\nhold that, under Barker, any delay that results from a\nState’s failure to provide funding for an indigent’s defense\nweighs against the State. On remand, the Louisiana court\ncould conduct the Barker analysis under the correct legal\nstandard.\n                             III\n  Louisiana’s primary arguments are either unpersuasive\nor are more appropriately addressed on remand. They\nprovide no barrier to the Court’s resolution of the question\npresented.\n  Louisiana’s procedures require that capital defendants\nbe appointed two capital-qualified attorneys. See La. Sup.\nCt. Rule 31(A)(1)(a) (2012). In Louisiana’s view, the fact\nthat there may have been insufficient funds for a second\nlawyer did not contribute to the delay. See Brief for Re-\nspondent 31–33. It contends that these procedural rules\ndid not create an affirmative right to two lawyers, so that\nBoyer could have forgone the second lawyer at any time\nand gone to trial if he had so desired. See id., at 32 (citing\nLa. Sup. Ct. Rules 31(A)(1)(a), (B)).\n  The Louisiana court treated it as a given that Boyer\ncould not proceed to trial during the period of the funding\ncrisis. We therefore have no need to address how these\nstate-law procedures might have affected the overall\nreason for the delay. Cf. Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S.\n684, 690–691 (1975); General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503\nU. S. 181, 187 (1992). To the extent Louisiana disputes\nthe lower court’s conclusions about how state-law princi-\n8                   BOYER v.

And in fact, Boyer\nalleged that there were substantial costs other than the\nappointment of a second lawyer, such as the expenses\nassociated with pretrial investigation, that necessitated\nadditional resources before any counsel—one or two—\ncould have gone to trial. App. 377a.\n   Louisiana also contends that the delay was mostly\nattributable to Boyer, because he failed to move the case\nforward. Brief for Respondent 28–38. The Louisiana\ncourt did not so find.

In any event, the question of how Boyer’s\ndiligence, or lack thereof, affects the overall balance of\nthe Barker factors would be an appropriate subject for\nremand.\n   JUSTICE ALITO’s concurrence largely adopts Louisiana’s\narguments, and contends that the majority of the delay\nshould be attributed to Boyer’s requests for continuances\nin the trial court, and not the funding crisis. See ante, at\n3. It is a mistake to second-guess the state court’s findings\non this point, particularly because Louisiana conceded\nbelow that most of the delay resulted from the lack of\nfunding for Boyer’s defense. See n. 3, supra. Contrary to\nthe concurrence’s assertion, see ante, at 3–4, n. 1, this\nconcession was not made arguendo. The most reasonable\nreading of the state court’s opinion is that it simply ac-\ncepted Louisiana’s concession when it found that the\n“majority of the seven-year delay was caused by the ‘lack\nof funding.’ ” 56 So. 3d, at 1142.

The premise of that question is\nthat a breakdown in Louisiana’s system for paying the\nattorneys representing petitioner, an indigent defendant\nwho was charged with a capital offense, caused most of\nthe lengthy delay between his arrest and trial. Because the\nrecord shows otherwise, I agree that the writ of certiorari\nwas improvidently granted.\n   In February 2002, petitioner and his brother were\nhitchhiking in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. Petitioner\nrobbed and murdered a driver who picked them up. After\nenlisting his brother to help him cover up the crime, peti-\ntioner fled to Florida, where he was captured about a\nmonth later. The evidence of petitioner’s guilt was over-\nwhelming. He gave the police a detailed statement de-\nscribing the murder; his brother, an eyewitness, agreed to\ntestify about the crime; multiple other members of peti-\ntioner’s family told police that they had heard petitioner\nconfess; and petitioner’s fingerprints were found in the\n2                   BOYER v. LOUISIANA\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nvictim’s truck.\n   Louisiana prosecutors announced that they would seek\nthe death penalty, and the state court appointed Thomas\nLorenzi, an experienced trial attorney, to serve as peti-\ntioner’s primary defense counsel. For the next five years,\nMr. Lorenzi led petitioner’s defense, but he was assisted at\nall times by at least one highly credentialed but less expe-\nrienced attorney from the Louisiana Capital Assistance\nCenter (LCAC).\n   The attorneys from the LCAC were paid by the State,\nbut there was confusion about which branch of the state\ngovernment was responsible for paying Mr. Lorenzi’s fees.\nThe trial court promptly scheduled a hearing on that pre-\nliminary matter, but the hearing was repeatedly put off\nat the urging of the defense. Over the course of more\nthan three years, the defense requested that the hearing\nbe continued on eight separate occasions, causing a total\ndelay of approximately 20 months. The trial court also\nissued several other continuances without any objection\nfrom the defense, delaying the hearing an additional 15\nmonths. And just when it seemed that the hearing would\nfinally be held, Hurricane Rita forced the Calcasieu Parish\nCourthouse to close.\n   The trial court held the hearing on March 27, 2006, and\nat that time it became clear that Mr. Lorenzi’s fees could\nnot be fully paid until the start of the next fiscal year. Ten\nmonths later, the State broke the resulting impasse by\nannouncing that it would no longer seek the death pen-\nalty. That greatly reduced the complexity and cost of peti-\ntioner’s defense and allowed his case to proceed. Mr.\nLorenzi withdrew, and attorneys from the LCAC accepted\nthe role of lead counsel.\n   From that point, the case proceeded at a plodding pace.\nPetitioner filed voluminous pretrial motions, took multiple\ninterlocutory appeals, and twice demanded the recusal of\nthe trial judge. The trial court halted proceedings for 11\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

At last, despite petitioner’s\ncontention that he needed still more time to prepare, the\ntrial began on September 22, 2009. A jury found peti-\ntioner guilty of second-degree murder and armed robbery.\n   In sum, the record shows that the single largest share\nof the delay in this case was the direct result of defense\nrequests for continuances, that other defense motions\ncaused substantial additional delay, and that much of the\nrest of the delay was caused by events beyond anyone’s\ncontrol. It is also quite clear that the delay caused by the\ndefense likely worked in petitioner’s favor. The state court\nobserved that petitioner’s assertions of his speedy trial\nright were “more perfunctory than aggressive.” 2010–693,\np. 34 (La. App. 3 Cir. 2/2/11), 56 So. 3d 1119, 1143. And\nwhat started out as a very strong case of first-degree\nmurder ended up, after much delay, in a conviction for\nlesser offenses.\n   The dissent would ignore what the record plainly shows\nbased largely on the Louisiana Court of Appeals’ obser-\nvation that “[t]he majority of the seven-year delay was\ncaused by the ‘lack of funding.’ ” Id., at 1142. See post, at\n5, 8 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But when this statement\nis read in context, what it most likely means is not that\nthe delay in question was caused by the State’s failure to\nprovide funding but simply that the delay was attributable\nto the funding issue. And as noted, most of this delay was\ncaused by the many defense requests for continuances of\nhearings on the issue of funding. If the defense had not\nsought and obtained those continuances, the trial might\nwell have commenced at a much earlier date—and might\nhave reached a conclusion far less favorable to the\ndefense.*\n——————\n  * The dissent also claims that “Louisiana conceded below that most of\nthe delay resulted from the lack of funding for Boyer’s defense.” Post,\n4                        BOYER v.

But the dissent’s only citation is to the State’s\nargument in the alternative that even if the legislature’s failure to\nappropriate funds for the defense caused the delay, that delay should\nnot count against the prosecution for purposes of Louisiana’s statutory\nspeedy trial requirement. The State in no way conceded that it caused\nthe delay in this case.

The Louisiana Court of Appeal rejected Boyer’s\nclaim that this delay violated his right to a speedy trial.\nIn doing so, the court found that most of the delay in\nBoyer’s case was caused by the State’s failure to pay for\nhis defense due to a “ ‘funding crisis’ experienced by the\nState of Louisiana.” 2010–693, p. 32 (La. App. 3 Cir.\n2/2/11), 56 So. 3d 1119, 1142. Nevertheless, the court did\nnot weigh that part of the delay against the State in as-\nsessing the merits of Boyer’s claim, reasoning that it was\n“ ‘out of the State’s control.’ ” Id., at 1145.\n    We granted certiorari to decide whether a delay caused\nby a State’s failure to fund counsel for an indigent’s de-\nfense should be weighed against the State in determining\nwhether there was a deprivation of a defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment right to a speedy trial. 568 U. S. ___ (2012).\nRather than dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, I\nwould simply address this question. Our precedents pro-\nvide a clear answer: Such a delay should weigh against the\nState. It is important for States to understand that they\nhave an obligation to protect a defendant’s constitutional\nright to a speedy trial. I respectfully dissent.\n2                       BOYER v. LOUISIANA\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                              I\n  The decision below describes the facts as follows. On\nFebruary 4, 2002, Boyer and his brother were walking by\nthe side of the road in Sulphur, Louisiana. Bradlee Marsh\nstopped his truck and gave the two men a ride. Once\ninside the truck, Boyer demanded money. When Marsh\nrefused, Boyer shot him three times in the head and then\ntook some cash and a silver chain from his person. Marsh\neventually died of his wounds. On March, 8, 2002, Boyer\nwas arrested in Jacksonville, Florida, and was indicted\nin Louisiana for first-degree murder on June 6, 2002, in\nviolation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §14:30 (West 1997). Loui-\nsiana sought the death penalty.\n  Boyer filed a motion to determine the source of funds for\nhis defense in November 2002. A hearing on the motion\nwas held on August 15, 2003, which was continued until a\nlater date. From that point on, “the only matters that\ncame before the trial court concerned the source of fund-\ning.” 56 So. 3d, at 1142. Boyer and the State filed numer-\nous continuances over the next two years that further\npostponed the funding hearing.\n  On July 7, 2005, Boyer filed a motion to quash the in-\ndictment as a violation of his right to a speedy trial under\nthe Louisiana Constitution, the State’s speedy trial stat-\nute, and the Sixth Amendment.1 This hearing was itself\npostponed. Among other things, disruptions caused by\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita resulted in further delay.\nWhen a hearing on the motion to quash was finally held,\ndefense counsel moved to dismiss Boyer’s federal speedy\n——————\n   1 Under the relevant statute, “no trial shall be commenced . . . [i]n\n\ncapital cases after three years from the date of the institution of the\nprosecution.” La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 578(1) (West 2003). The\ntrial court may dismiss the indictment upon the expiration of the 3-year\nperiod. See Art. 581.

It concluded that under Louisiana’s speedy\ntrial statute, such delays could not be attributed to the\nprosecution because they were “beyond [its] control” and\nrested instead with the “legislature.” App. 703a. The\nLouisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed. 56 So.\n3d, at 1142.\n   On May 21, 2007, Louisiana amended the indictment to\nreduce the charge to second-degree murder, which is a\nnoncapital offense. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §14:30.1(B)\n(West 1997). The same day, the State filed a bill of infor-\nmation charging Boyer with armed robbery with a fire-\narm, a violation of §14:64.\n   On January 22, 2008, Boyer filed a second motion to\nquash the indictment and bill of information on the\ngrounds that the pretrial delay violated his right to a\nspeedy trial under the Louisiana Constitution and the\nSixth Amendment. The trial court denied the motion. On\nJuly 19, 2008, the court found Boyer incompetent to stand\ntrial, but later found his competency restored on April 15,\n2009. A trial commenced on September 22, 2009, more\nthan seven years after Boyer’s arrest. A week later, the\njury entered a verdict finding Boyer guilty of second-\ndegree murder and armed robbery.\n   The Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed\nBoyer’s conviction, finding, as relevant here, that there\nhad been no violation of Boyer’s right to a speedy trial\nunder the Sixth Amendment. 56 So. 3d, at 1139–1145.\nApplying our decision in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514\n(1972), the court recognized that the more than seven\nyears from the date of arrest to trial was “presumptively\n——————\n   2 Boyer’s counsel moved to dismiss the constitutional claim because\n\nhe lacked the “resources . . . to be able to prove prejudice [in] an eviden-\ntiary hearing.” App. 688a.\n4                    BOYER v.

It then went on to consider\nthe reason for the delay, and found that the “majority of\nthe . . . delay was caused by the ‘lack of funding’ ” for Boy-\ner’s defense. Id., at 1142.\n   The court, however, declined to weigh this period of the\ndelay against the State at all for the purposes of its analy-\nsis under Barker. 56 So. 3d, at 1145. It found that “[t]he\nfirst three years he was incarcerated, [while Boyer] was\ncharged with first degree murder . . . the progression of\nthe prosecution was ‘out of the State’s control.’ ” Ibid.\n(emphasis added). The Louisiana Supreme Court denied\nreview. 2011–0769 (La. 1/20/12), 78 So. 3d 138, 139.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n    The Sixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy\n. . . trial.” In Barker, we explained that whether there has\nbeen a violation of a defendant’s right to a speedy trial\nturns on a balancing test that “compels courts to approach\nspeedy trial cases on an ad hoc basis.” 407 U. S., at 530.\nWe identified four factors that courts should consider as\npart of that inquiry. These include the “[l]ength of delay,\nthe reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his\nright, and prejudice to the defendant.” Ibid.\n    While each of the factors is relevant, “[t]he flag all liti-\ngants seek to capture is the second factor, the reason for\ndelay.” United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 315\n(1986). We have explained that “different weights should\nbe assigned to different reasons.” Barker, 407 U. S., at\n531. “A deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to\nhamper the defense” is particularly serious, and “should\nbe weighted heavily against the government.” Ibid. “A\nmore neutral reason such as negligence or overcrowded\ncourts should be weighted less heavily but nevertheless\nshould be considered since the ultimate responsibility for\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

At the other end of the\nspectrum, “a valid reason, such as a missing witness,\nshould serve to justify appropriate delay.” Ibid.\n                              B\n  The Louisiana court found that the “majority of the\nseven-year delay” in Boyer’s case was caused by the “ ‘lack\nof funding’ ” made available for the defense, see 56 So. 3d,\nat 1142, and I defer to that factual determination, see\nHernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 366 (1991) (plurality\nopinion).3 The question is whether, once the Louisiana\ncourt found that most of the delay in Boyer’s case was\ncaused by the State’s failure to fund Boyer’s defense, the\ncourt was required to weigh that period of the delay\nagainst the State for the purposes of its analysis under\nBarker. The court’s conclusion that for the first three\nyears of Boyer’s case, the “progression of the prosecution\nwas ‘out of the State’s control’ ” makes clear that it did not.\n56 So. 3d, at 1145.\n  Our reasoning in Barker, however, requires that a delay\ncaused by a State’s failure to provide funding for an indi-\ngent’s defense must count against the State, and not the\naccused. As noted, we held there that even a more “neu-\ntral reason” for a delay such as “overcrowded courts”\nshould be weighed against the State, because “the ulti-\nmate responsibility for such circumstances” lies squarely\nwith the state system as a whole. 407 U. S., at 531. Ap-\n\n——————\n  3 Louisiana  previously conceded that the delay was caused by a lack\nof funding. See Brief in Opposition to Defendant’s Writ Application in\nNo. KW–07–00085 (La. App. 3 Cir.), App. 317a (“In this case, because\nthe defendant was without properly funded counsel for so long, the\nState simply could not ethically or legally bring him to trial.

LOUISIANA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nplying similar logic, we recently indicated that “[d]elay\nresulting from a systemic breakdown in the public defender\nsystem, could be charged to the State” as well. Vermont v.\nBrillon, 556 U. S. 81, 94 (2009) (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n   A State’s failure to provide adequate funding for an\nindigent’s defense that prevents a case from going to trial\nis no different. Where a State has failed to provide fund-\ning for the defense and that lack of funding causes a delay,\nthe defendant cannot reasonably be faulted. See Barker,\n407 U. S., at 531. Placing the consequences of such a\ndelay squarely on the State’s shoulders is proper for the\nsimple reason that an indigent defendant has no control\nover whether a State has set aside funds to pay his lawyer\nor fund any necessary investigation. The failure to fund\nan indigent’s defense is not as serious as a deliberate\neffort by a State to cause delay. Ibid. But States routinely\nmake tradeoffs in the allocation of limited resources, and\nit is reasonable that a State bear the consequences of\nthese choices.\n   The Louisiana court’s analysis under Barker was there-\nfore based on a critical misapprehension of our precedents:\nIt did not attribute responsibility for the delay to the\nState, and thus incorrectly applied the factor that we have\nfound to be especially significant. See Loud Hawk, 474\nU. S., at 315. We have explained that, in every case,\n“courts must still engage in a difficult and sensitive bal-\nancing process,” and “none of the four factors [is] either a\nnecessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a depri-\nvation of the right of speedy trial.” Barker, 407 U. S., at\n533. Because the Barker factors must be viewed collec-\ntively, this error could very well have affected the out-\ncome. “[T]he balance arrived at in close cases ordinarily\nwould not prompt this Court’s review,” but the Louisiana\ncourt’s misattribution of the reason for the delay was a\n“fundamental error . . . that calls for this Court’s correc-\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

S., at 91.\n   Our precedents therefore point the way to a straight-\nforward resolution of this case. I take no view as to how\nthe other elements of the Barker inquiry should be weighed,\nor the ultimate issue whether the delay violated Boyer’s\nright to a speedy trial. Instead, I would decide only\nthe narrow question on which we granted certiorari and\nhold that, under Barker, any delay that results from a\nState’s failure to provide funding for an indigent’s defense\nweighs against the State. On remand, the Louisiana court\ncould conduct the Barker analysis under the correct legal\nstandard.\n                             III\n  Louisiana’s primary arguments are either unpersuasive\nor are more appropriately addressed on remand. They\nprovide no barrier to the Court’s resolution of the question\npresented.\n  Louisiana’s procedures require that capital defendants\nbe appointed two capital-qualified attorneys. See La. Sup.\nCt. Rule 31(A)(1)(a) (2012). In Louisiana’s view, the fact\nthat there may have been insufficient funds for a second\nlawyer did not contribute to the delay. See Brief for Re-\nspondent 31–33. It contends that these procedural rules\ndid not create an affirmative right to two lawyers, so that\nBoyer could have forgone the second lawyer at any time\nand gone to trial if he had so desired. See id., at 32 (citing\nLa. Sup. Ct. Rules 31(A)(1)(a), (B)).\n  The Louisiana court treated it as a given that Boyer\ncould not proceed to trial during the period of the funding\ncrisis. We therefore have no need to address how these\nstate-law procedures might have affected the overall\nreason for the delay. Cf. Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S.\n684, 690–691 (1975); General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503\nU. S. 181, 187 (1992). To the extent Louisiana disputes\nthe lower court’s conclusions about how state-law princi-\n8                   BOYER v. LOUISIANA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nples influenced the delay, these points could have been\naddressed in state court on remand. And in fact, Boyer\nalleged that there were substantial costs other than the\nappointment of a second lawyer, such as the expenses\nassociated with pretrial investigation, that necessitated\nadditional resources before any counsel—one or two—\ncould have gone to trial. App. 377a.\n   Louisiana also contends that the delay was mostly\nattributable to Boyer, because he failed to move the case\nforward. Brief for Respondent 28–38. The Louisiana\ncourt did not so find. And Boyer disputes this view; he\ncontends that statutory procedures and their time limita-\ntions under Louisiana law prevented him from bringing\nhis speedy trial claim any earlier than he did. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 28. In any event, the question of how Boyer’s\ndiligence, or lack thereof, affects the overall balance of\nthe Barker factors would be an appropriate subject for\nremand.\n   JUSTICE ALITO’s concurrence largely adopts Louisiana’s\narguments, and contends that the majority of the delay\nshould be attributed to Boyer’s requests for continuances\nin the trial court, and not the funding crisis. See ante, at\n3. It is a mistake to second-guess the state court’s findings\non this point, particularly because Louisiana conceded\nbelow that most of the delay resulted from the lack of\nfunding for Boyer’s defense. See n. 3, supra. Contrary to\nthe concurrence’s assertion, see ante, at 3–4, n. 1, this\nconcession was not made arguendo. The most reasonable\nreading of the state court’s opinion is that it simply ac-\ncepted Louisiana’s concession when it found that the\n“majority of the seven-year delay was caused by the ‘lack\nof funding.’ ” 56 So. 3d, at 1142. There is no reason this\nCourt should comb through the record to allow Louisiana\nto turn its back on this prior position, and risk substitut-\ning this Court’s judgment for that of a state court on a\nquestion that is closely intertwined with state procedural\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

These matters of state law are better suited for the\nLouisiana court to address in the first instance on remand.\n  Louisiana’s arguments accordingly provide no reason to\ndecline to address the question of federal law on which we\ngranted certiorari and which the parties argued.\n                             IV\n   The Court’s failure to resolve this case is especially\nregrettable, because it does not seem to be an isolated one.\nRather, Boyer’s case appears to be illustrative of larger,\nsystemic problems in Louisiana.\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court has suggested on multi-\nple occasions that the State’s failure to provide funding for\nindigent defense contributes to extended pretrial deten-\ntions. See State v. Citizen, 2004–1841, pp. 14–17 (La.\n4/1/05), 898 So. 2d 325, 336–338; State v. Wigley, 624\nSo. 2d 425, 429 (La. 1993); State v. Peart, 621 So. 2d 780,\n791 (La. 1993). There is also empirical evidence support-\ning that assessment. In New Orleans Parish, for example,\na recent study found that more than 22 percent of pending\ncriminal cases were more than one year old. Metropoli-\ntan Crime Commission, 2011 Orleans Parish Judicial Ac-\ncountability Report 1 (July 2012). Another study found\nthat the average time between felony arrest and trial in\nCalcasieu Parish, the jurisdiction where Boyer was tried,\nwas 501 days in the years before Boyer’s arrest. M. Kurth\n& D. Burckel, Defending the Indigent in Southwest Loui-\nsiana 27 (2003). More broadly, the public defender system\nseems to be significantly understaffed. See E. Lewis & D.\nGoyette, Report on the Evaluation of the Office of the\nOrleans Public Defenders 28–29 (July 2012) (noting that\nin New Orleans, public defenders handle approximately\n277 felonies per year, which is nearly twice the number\nrecommended by ABA standards (citing ABA Formal\nOpinion 06–441 (2006))); National Legal Aid & Defender\nAssociation, In Defense of Public Access to Justice, An\n10                  BOYER v.

Conditions of this kind cannot\npersist without endangering constitutional rights.\n                        *    *    *\n  The Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal made a\nserious error: It did not charge the State’s failure to pay\nBoyer’s lawyer against the State in determining whether\nthere was a violation of his right to a speedy trial. Be-\ncause a State bears the ultimate responsibility for funding\nadequately an indigent’s defense, our precedents require a\ncourt to count this delay against the State and not the\ncriminal defendant.\n  Rather than dismiss the writ, I would answer the\nquestion on which we granted certiorari and remand for\nthe Louisiana court to conduct the Barker analysis anew.\nI respectfully dissent from the Court’s judgment of\ndismissal.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/866023/", "sha1": "3e2b44f05dbd5ca2340411756fdf341a0adeca73", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2012-040", "time_retrieved": "2013-04-29T07:19:00.752286"}
