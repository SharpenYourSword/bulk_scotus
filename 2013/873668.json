CALVIN\n\n                O’NEIL JACKSON\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 12–694.   Decided June 3, 2013\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   In this case, the Court of Appeals held that respondent,\nwho was convicted of rape and other serious crimes, is en-\ntitled to relief under the federal habeas statute because\nthe Supreme Court of Nevada unreasonably applied clearly\nestablished Supreme Court precedent regarding a crim-\ninal defendant’s constitutional right to present a defense.\nAt his trial, respondent unsuccessfully sought to introduce\nevidence for the purpose of showing that the rape victim\npreviously reported that he had assaulted her but that\nthe police had been unable to substantiate those allega-\ntions. The state supreme court held that this evidence\nwas properly excluded, and no prior decision of this Court\nclearly establishes that the exclusion of this evidence\nviolated respondent’s federal constitutional rights. The\ndecision of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.\n                             I\n  Respondent Calvin Jackson had a tumultuous decade-\nlong romantic relationship with Annette Heathmon. In\n1998, after several previous attempts to end the relation-\nship, Heathmon relocated to a new apartment in North\nLas Vegas without telling respondent where she was mov-\ning. Respondent learned of Heathmon’s whereabouts,\nand on the night of October 21, 1998, he visited her\napartment. What happened next was the focus of re-\nspondent’s trial.\n  Heathmon told police and later testified that respondent\n2                   NEVADA v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nforced his way into her apartment and threatened to kill\nher with a screwdriver if she did not have sex with him.\nAfter raping Heathmon, respondent hit her, stole a ring\nfrom her bedroom, and dragged her out of the apartment\nand toward his car by the neck and hair. A witness con-\nfronted the couple, and respondent fled. Police observed\ninjuries to Heathmon’s neck and scalp that were consis-\ntent with her account of events, and respondent was even-\ntually arrested.\n  Although respondent did not testify at trial, he dis-\ncussed Heathmon’s allegations with police shortly after his\narrest, and his statements were admitted into evidence\nat trial. Respondent acknowledged that Heathmon might\nhave agreed to have sex because the two were alone and\n“she was scared that [he] might do something,” Tr. 305,\nbut he claimed that the sex was consensual. Respondent\nalso admitted striking Heathmon inside the apartment\nbut denied pulling her outside by the neck and hair.\n  Shortly before trial, Heathmon sent the judge a letter\nrecanting her prior accusations and stating that she would\nnot testify. She went into hiding, but police eventually\nfound her and took her into custody as a material wit-\nness. Once in custody, Heathmon disavowed the letter and\nagreed to testify. When asked about the letter at trial, she\nstated that three of respondent’s associates had forced her\nto write it and had threatened to hurt her if she appeared\nin court.\n  At trial, the theory of the defense was that Heathmon\nhad fabricated the sexual assault and had reported it to\npolice in an effort to control respondent. To support that\ntheory, the defense sought to introduce testimony and\npolice reports showing that Heathmon had called the\npolice on several prior occasions claiming that respondent\nhad raped or otherwise assaulted her. Police were unable\nto corroborate many of these prior allegations, and in\nseveral cases they were skeptical of her claims. Although\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nthe trial court gave the defense wide latitude to cross-\nexamine Heathmon about those prior incidents, it refused\nto admit the police reports or to allow the defense to call as\nwitnesses the officers involved. The jury found respondent\nguilty, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n   Respondent appealed his conviction to the Nevada Su-\npreme Court, arguing, among other things, that the trial\ncourt’s refusal to admit extrinsic evidence relating to the\nprior incidents violated his federal constitutional right\nto present a complete defense, but the Nevada Supreme\nCourt rejected that argument.\n   After exhausting his remedies in state court, respondent\nfiled a federal habeas petition, again arguing that the trial\ncourt’s ruling had violated his right to present a defense.\nApplying AEDPA’s deferential standard of review, the\nDistrict Court denied relief, but a divided panel of the\nNinth Circuit reversed. 688 F. 3d 1091 (2012). The major-\nity held that extrinsic evidence of Heathmon’s prior alle-\ngations was critical to respondent’s defense, that the\nexclusion of that evidence violated respondent’s constitu-\ntional right to present a defense, and that the Nevada\nSupreme Court’s decision to the contrary was an unrea-\nsonable application of this Court’s precedents. Id., at\n1097–1101. Although it acknowledged that the state court\nhad ruled that the evidence was inadmissible as a matter\nof state law, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the impact\nof the State’s rules of evidence on the defense “was dispro-\nportionate to the state’s interest in . . . exclusion.” Id., at\n1101–1104. Finding that the trial court’s erroneous evi-\ndentiary ruling was not harmless, id., at 1104–1106, the\nNinth Circuit ordered the State either to retry or to re-\nlease respondent.\n                         II\n  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA) authorizes a federal habeas court to grant\n4                   NEVADA v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nrelief to a prisoner whose state court conviction “involved\nan unreasonable application of . . . clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). It is settled that\na federal habeas court may overturn a state court’s appli-\ncation of federal law only if it is so erroneous that “there\nis no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the\nstate court’s decision conflicts with this Court’s prece-\ndents.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 13). Applying that deferential standard, we\nconclude that the Nevada Supreme Court’s decision was\nreasonable.\n   “[T]he Constitution guarantees criminal defendants ‘a\nmeaningful opportunity to present a complete defense,’ ”\nCrane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 690 (1986) (quoting\nCalifornia v. Trombetta, 467 U. S. 479, 485 (1984)), but\nwe have also recognized that “ ‘state and federal rulemak-\ners have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish\nrules excluding evidence from criminal trials,’ ” Holmes v.\nSouth Carolina, 547 U. S. 319, 324 (2006) (quoting United\nStates v. Scheffer, 523 U. S. 303, 308 (1998)). Only rarely\nhave we held that the right to present a complete defense\nwas violated by the exclusion of defense evidence under a\nstate rule of evidence. See 547 U. S., at 331 (rule did not\nrationally serve any discernible purpose); Rock v. Arkan-\nsas, 483 U. S. 44, 61 (1987) (rule arbitrary); Chambers v.\nMississippi, 410 U. S. 284, 302–303 (1973) (State did not\neven attempt to explain the reason for its rule); Washing-\nton v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14, 22 (1967) (rule could not be\nrationally defended).\n   As the Ninth Circuit conceded, “[t]he Nevada Supreme\nCourt recognized and applied the correct legal principle.”\n688 F. 3d, at 1097. But contrary to the Ninth Circuit’s\nconclusion, the State Supreme Court’s application of our\nclearly established precedents was reasonable. The start-\ning point in the state court’s analysis was a state statute\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Long,\n140 S. W. 3d 27, 30 (Mo. 2004)). These are “good rea-\nson[s]” for limiting the use of extrinsic evidence, Clark v.\nArizona, 548 U. S. 735, 770 (2006), and the Nevada statute\nis akin to the widely accepted rule of evidence law that\ngenerally precludes the admission of evidence of specific\ninstances of a witness’ conduct to prove the witness’ char-\nacter for untruthfulness. See Fed. Rule Evid. 608(b); C.\nMueller & L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence §6.27, pp. 497–499\n(4th ed. 2009). The constitutional propriety of this rule\ncannot be seriously disputed.\n   As an exception to the prohibition contained in Nev.\nRev. Stat. §50.085(3), the Nevada Supreme Court held in\nMiller v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Nev.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499–500, 779 P. 2d 87, 88–89\n(1989), that “in a sexual assault case defense counsel may\ncross-examine a complaining witness about previous fab-\nricated sexual assault accusations and, if the witness\ndenies making the allegations, may introduce extrinsic\nevidence to prove that fabricated charges were made by\nthat witness in the past.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 66. But in\norder to introduce evidence showing that the witness\npreviously made false allegations, the defendant must file\nwritten notice, and the trial court must hold a hearing.\nMiller, supra, at 501, 779 P. 2d, at 90. Respondent did not\nfile the requisite notice, and the State Supreme Court\nupheld the exclusion of evidence of prior sexual assault\ncomplaints on this basis.\n6                   NEVADA v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n  No decision of this Court clearly establishes that this\nnotice requirement is unconstitutional. Nor, contrary to\nthe reasoning of the Ninth Circuit majority, see 688 F.\n3d, at 1103–1104, do our cases clearly establish that the\nConstitution requires a case-by-case balancing of interests\nbefore such a rule can be enforced. The decision on which\nthe Ninth Circuit relied, Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U. S. 145\n(1991), is very far afield. In that case, we reversed a\ndecision holding that the Sixth Amendment categorically\nprohibits the enforcement of a rule that required a rape\ndefendant to provide pretrial notice if he wished to intro-\nduce evidence of his prior sexual relationship with the\ncomplaining witness. The Court did not even suggest,\nmuch less hold, that it is unconstitutional to enforce such\na rule unless a case-by-case balancing of interests weighs\nin favor of enforcement. Instead, the Court “express[ed]\nno opinion as to whether or not preclusion was justified in\nth[at] case” and left it for the state courts to address that\nquestion in the first instance. Id., at 153. No fair-minded\njurist could think that Lucas clearly establishes that the\nenforcement of the Nevada rule in this case is inconsistent\nwith the Constitution.\n  Some of the evidence that respondent sought to in-\ntroduce concerned prior incidents in which the victim re-\nported that respondent beat her up but did not sexually\nassault her, and the state supreme court did not view its\nMiller decision as applying in such circumstances. But the\nstate court did not simply invoke the rule set out in Nev.\nRev. Stat. §50.085(3). Rather, the court reasoned that the\nproffered evidence had little impeachment value because\nat most it showed simply that the victim’s reports could\nnot be corroborated. The admission of extrinsic evidence\nof specific instances of a witness’ conduct to impeach the\nwitness’ credibility may confuse the jury, unfairly embar-\nrass the victim, surprise the prosecution, and unduly\nprolong the trial. No decision of this Court clearly estab-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nlishes that the exclusion of such evidence for such reasons\nin a particular case violates the Constitution.\n   In holding that respondent is entitled to habeas relief,\nthe Ninth Circuit pointed to two of its own AEDPA deci-\nsions in which it granted habeas relief to state prisoners\nwho were not allowed to conduct a full cross-examination\nof the witnesses against them. 688 F. 3d, at 1098–1101\n(discussing Fowler v. Sacramento Cty. Sheriff ’s Dept., 421\nF. 3d 1027, 1035–1038 (CA9 2005) and Holley v. Yar-\nborough, 568 F. 3d 1091, 1098–1101 (CA9 2009)). Those\ncases in turn relied on Supreme Court decisions holding\nthat various restrictions on a defendant’s ability to cross-\nexamine witnesses violate the Confrontation Clause of the\nSixth Amendment. See, e.g., Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U. S.\n227, 231 (1988) (per curiam); Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475\nU. S. 673, 678–679 (1986); Davis v. Alaska, 415 U. S.\n308, 315–316 (1974). But this Court has never held that\nthe Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to\nintroduce extrinsic evidence for impeachment purposes.\nSee Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U. S. 15, 22 (1985)\n(per curiam) (observing that “the Confrontation Clause is\ngenerally satisfied when the defense is given a full and\nfair opportunity to . . . expose [testimonial] infirmities\nthrough cross-examination”). See also Jordan v. Warden,\n675 F. 3d 586, 596 (CA6 2012); Brown v. Ruane, 630 F. 3d\n62, 70 (CA1 2011).\n   The Ninth Circuit elided the distinction between cross-\nexamination and extrinsic evidence by characterizing the\ncases as recognizing a broad right to present “evidence\nbearing on [a witness’] credibility.” 688 F. 3d, at 1099. By\nframing our precedents at such a high level of generality,\na lower federal court could transform even the most imag-\ninative extension of existing case law into “clearly estab-\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.”\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). In thus collapsing the distinction\nbetween “an unreasonable application of federal law” and\n8                   NEVADA v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nwhat a lower court believes to be “an incorrect or erroneous\napplication of federal law,” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.\n362, 412 (2000), the Ninth Circuit’s approach would defeat\nthe substantial deference that AEDPA requires.\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 873668, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/06/03/nevada_v._jackson.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 569 U.

See Fed. Rule Evid. 608(b); C.\nMueller & L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence §6.27, pp. 497–499\n(4th ed. 2009). The constitutional propriety of this rule\ncannot be seriously disputed.\n   As an exception to the prohibition contained in Nev.\nRev. Stat. §50.085(3), the Nevada Supreme Court held in\nMiller v. State, 105 Nev. 497, 499–500, 779 P. 2d 87, 88–89\n(1989), that “in a sexual assault case defense counsel may\ncross-examine a complaining witness about previous fab-\nricated sexual assault accusations and, if the witness\ndenies making the allegations, may introduce extrinsic\nevidence to prove that fabricated charges were made by\nthat witness in the past.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 66. But in\norder to introduce evidence showing that the witness\npreviously made false allegations, the defendant must file\nwritten notice, and the trial court must hold a hearing.\nMiller, supra, at 501, 779 P. 2d, at 90. Respondent did not\nfile the requisite notice, and the State Supreme Court\nupheld the exclusion of evidence of prior sexual assault\ncomplaints on this basis.\n6                   NEVADA v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n  No decision of this Court clearly establishes that this\nnotice requirement is unconstitutional. Nor, contrary to\nthe reasoning of the Ninth Circuit majority, see 688 F.\n3d, at 1103–1104, do our cases clearly establish that the\nConstitution requires a case-by-case balancing of interests\nbefore such a rule can be enforced. The decision on which\nthe Ninth Circuit relied, Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U. S. 145\n(1991), is very far afield. In that case, we reversed a\ndecision holding that the Sixth Amendment categorically\nprohibits the enforcement of a rule that required a rape\ndefendant to provide pretrial notice if he wished to intro-\nduce evidence of his prior sexual relationship with the\ncomplaining witness. The Court did not even suggest,\nmuch less hold, that it is unconstitutional to enforce such\na rule unless a case-by-case balancing of interests weighs\nin favor of enforcement. Instead, the Court “express[ed]\nno opinion as to whether or not preclusion was justified in\nth[at] case” and left it for the state courts to address that\nquestion in the first instance. Id., at 153. No fair-minded\njurist could think that Lucas clearly establishes that the\nenforcement of the Nevada rule in this case is inconsistent\nwith the Constitution.\n  Some of the evidence that respondent sought to in-\ntroduce concerned prior incidents in which the victim re-\nported that respondent beat her up but did not sexually\nassault her, and the state supreme court did not view its\nMiller decision as applying in such circumstances. But the\nstate court did not simply invoke the rule set out in Nev.\nRev. Stat. §50.085(3). Rather, the court reasoned that the\nproffered evidence had little impeachment value because\nat most it showed simply that the victim’s reports could\nnot be corroborated. The admission of extrinsic evidence\nof specific instances of a witness’ conduct to impeach the\nwitness’ credibility may confuse the jury, unfairly embar-\nrass the victim, surprise the prosecution, and unduly\nprolong the trial. No decision of this Court clearly estab-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nlishes that the exclusion of such evidence for such reasons\nin a particular case violates the Constitution.\n   In holding that respondent is entitled to habeas relief,\nthe Ninth Circuit pointed to two of its own AEDPA deci-\nsions in which it granted habeas relief to state prisoners\nwho were not allowed to conduct a full cross-examination\nof the witnesses against them. 688 F. 3d, at 1098–1101\n(discussing Fowler v. Sacramento Cty. Sheriff ’s Dept., 421\nF. 3d 1027, 1035–1038 (CA9 2005) and Holley v. Yar-\nborough, 568 F. 3d 1091, 1098–1101 (CA9 2009)). Those\ncases in turn relied on Supreme Court decisions holding\nthat various restrictions on a defendant’s ability to cross-\nexamine witnesses violate the Confrontation Clause of the\nSixth Amendment. See, e.g., Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U. S.\n227, 231 (1988) (per curiam); Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475\nU. S. 673, 678–679 (1986); Davis v. Alaska, 415 U. S.\n308, 315–316 (1974). But this Court has never held that\nthe Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to\nintroduce extrinsic evidence for impeachment purposes.\nSee Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U. S. 15, 22 (1985)\n(per curiam) (observing that “the Confrontation Clause is\ngenerally satisfied when the defense is given a full and\nfair opportunity to . . . expose [testimonial] infirmities\nthrough cross-examination”). See also Jordan v. Warden,\n675 F. 3d 586, 596 (CA6 2012); Brown v. Ruane, 630 F. 3d\n62, 70 (CA1 2011).\n   The Ninth Circuit elided the distinction between cross-\nexamination and extrinsic evidence by characterizing the\ncases as recognizing a broad right to present “evidence\nbearing on [a witness’] credibility.” 688 F. 3d, at 1099. By\nframing our precedents at such a high level of generality,\na lower federal court could transform even the most imag-\ninative extension of existing case law into “clearly estab-\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.”\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). In thus collapsing the distinction\nbetween “an unreasonable application of federal law” and\n8                   NEVADA v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nwhat a lower court believes to be “an incorrect or erroneous\napplication of federal law,” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.\n362, 412 (2000), the Ninth Circuit’s approach would defeat\nthe substantial deference that AEDPA requires.\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/873668/", "sha1": "80e4008f05fa8425f7263ea3a97c7c052443e721", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2012-052", "time_retrieved": "2013-06-03T07:43:22.525558"}
