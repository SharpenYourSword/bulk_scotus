DAVILA\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 12–167.      Argued April 15, 2013—Decided June 13, 2013\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 governs guilty pleas. Rule\n  11(c)(1) instructs that “[t]he court must not participate in [plea] dis-\n  cussions,” and Rule 11(h) states that a “variance from the require-\n  ments of th[e] rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial\n  rights.” Rule 52(a), which covers trial court errors generally, similar-\n  ly prescribes: “Any error . . . that does not affect substantial rights\n  must be disregarded.”\n    Respondent Davila, while under indictment on multiple tax fraud\n  charges, wrote to the District Court, expressing dissatisfaction with\n  his court-appointed attorney. Complaining that his attorney offered\n  no defensive strategy, but simply advised him to plead guilty, Davila\n  requested new counsel. A Magistrate Judge held an in camera hear-\n  ing at which Davila and his attorney, but no representative of the\n  United States, appeared. At the hearing, the Magistrate Judge told\n  Davila that he would not get another court-appointed attorney and\n  that his best course, given the strength of the Government’s case,\n  was to plead guilty. More than three months later, Davila pleaded\n  guilty to a conspiracy charge in exchange for dismissal of 33 other\n  charges. He stated under oath before a U. S. District Judge that he\n  had not been forced or pressured to enter the plea, and he did not\n  mention the in camera hearing before the Magistrate Judge. Prior to\n  sentencing, however, Davila moved to vacate his plea and dismiss the\n  indictment, asserting that he had entered the plea for a “strategic”\n  reason, i.e., to force the Government to acknowledge errors in the in-\n  dictment. Finding that Davila’s plea had been knowing and volun-\n  tary, the District Judge denied the motion. Again, Davila said noth-\n  ing of the in camera hearing conducted by the Magistrate Judge. On\n  appeal, the Eleventh Circuit, following Circuit precedent, held that\n2                     UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    the Magistrate Judge’s violation of Rule 11(c)(1) required automatic\n    vacatur of Davila’s guilty plea, obviating any need to inquire whether\n    the error was prejudicial.\nHeld: Under Rule 11(h), vacatur of the plea is not in order if the record\n shows no prejudice to Davila’s decision to plead guilty. Pp. 7–14.\n    (a) Rule 11(c)(1)’s prohibition of judicial involvement in plea dis-\n cussions was included in the 1974 Amendment to the Rule out of con-\n cern that a defendant might be induced to plead guilty rather than\n risk antagonizing the judge who would preside at trial. Rule 11(h)\n was added in the 1983 Amendment to make clear that Rule 11 errors\n are not excepted from Rule 52(a)’s harmless-error inquiry. Rule 52\n also states, in subsection (b), that a “plain error that affects substan-\n tial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the\n [trial] court’s attention.” When Rule 52(a) governs, the prosecution\n has the burden of showing harmlessness, but when Rule 52(b) con-\n trols, the defendant must show that the error affects substantial\n rights. See United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 62.\n    As clarified in Vonn and United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542\n U. S. 74, Rule 11 error may be of the Rule 52(a) type or the Rule 52(b)\n kind, depending on when the error was raised. In Vonn, the judge\n who conducted the plea hearing failed to inform the defendant, as re-\n quired by Rule 11(c)(3), that he would have “the right to the assis-\n tance of counsel” if he proceeded to trial. The defendant first objected\n to the omission on appeal. This Court held that “a silent defendant\n has the burden to satisfy [Rule 52(b)’s] plain-error rule.” 535 U. S., at\n 59. In Dominguez Benitez, the error first raised on appeal was failure\n to warn the defendant, as Rule 11(c)(3)(B) instructs, that a plea could\n not be withdrawn even if the sentence imposed was higher than the\n plea-bargained sentence recommendation. The Court again held that\n Rule 52(b) controlled, and prescribed the standard a defendant silent\n until appeal must meet to show “plain error,” namely, “a reasonable\n probability that, but for the [Rule 11] error, he would not have en-\n tered the plea.” 542 U. S., at 83. Pp. 7–9.\n    (b) Here, the Magistrate Judge plainly violated Rule 11(c)(1) by ex-\n horting Davila to plead guilty. Davila contends that automatic vaca-\n tur, while inappropriate for most Rule 11 violations, should attend\n conduct banned by Rule 11(c)(1). He distinguishes plea-colloquy\n omissions, i.e., errors of the kind involved in Vonn and Dominguez\n Benitez, from pre-plea exhortations to admit guilt. The former come\n into play after a defendant has decided to plead guilty, the latter, be-\n fore a defendant has decided to plead guilty or to stand trial. Nothing\n in Rule 11’s text, however, indicates that the ban on judicial involve-\n ment in plea discussions, if dishonored, demands automatic vacatur\n without regard to case-specific circumstances. Nor does the Advisory\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Committee commentary single out any Rule 11 instruction as more\n  basic than others. And Rule 11(h), specifically designed to stop au-\n  tomatic vacaturs, calls for across-the-board application of the harm-\n  less-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error\n  rule).\n     Rule 11(c)(1) was adopted as a prophylactic measure, not one im-\n  pelled by the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional re-\n  quirement. Thus, violation of the Rule does not belong in the highly\n  exceptional category of structural errors—e.g., denial of counsel of\n  choice or denial of a public trial—that trigger automatic reversal be-\n  cause they undermine the fairness of the entire criminal proceeding.\n  United States v. Marcus, 560 U. S. 258, ___. Instead, in assessing\n  Rule 11 errors, a reviewing court must take account of all that tran-\n  spired in the trial court. Had Davila’s guilty plea followed soon after\n  the Magistrate Judge’s comments, the automatic-vacatur rule would\n  have remained erroneous. The Court of Appeals’ mistake in that re-\n  gard, however, might have been inconsequential, for the Magistrate\n  Judge’s exhortations, if they immediately elicited a plea, would likely\n  have qualified as prejudicial. Here, however, three months distanced\n  the in camera meeting conducted by the Magistrate Judge from Davi-\n  la’s appearance before the District Judge who examined and accepted\n  his guilty plea after an exemplary Rule 11 colloquy, at which Davila\n  had the opportunity to raise any questions he might have about mat-\n  ters relating to his plea. The Court of Appeals, therefore, should not\n  have assessed the Magistrate Judge’s comments in isolation. In-\n  stead, it should have considered, in light of the full record, whether it\n  was reasonably probable that, but for the Magistrate Judge’s com-\n  ments, Davila would have exercised his right to go to trial. Pp. 10–\n  14.\n     (c) The Court of Appeals, having concluded that the Magistrate\n  Judge’s comments violated Rule 11(c)(1), cut off further considera-\n  tion. It did not engage in a full-record assessment of the particular\n  facts of Davila’s case or the case-specific arguments raised by the\n  parties, including the Government’s assertion that Davila was not\n  prejudiced by the Magistrate Judge’s comments, and Davila’s conten-\n  tion that the extraordinary circumstances his case presents should\n  allow his claim to be judged under Rule 52(a)’s harmless-error stand-\n  ard rather than Rule 52(b)’s plain-error standard. The Court decides\n  only that the automatic-vacatur rule is incompatible with Rule 11(h)\n  and leaves all remaining issues to be addressed on remand.

ANTHONY DAVILA\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 13, 2013]\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Crim-\ninal Procedure, which governs guilty pleas. Two provi-\nsions of that rule are key here. The first, Rule 11(c)(1),\ninstructs that “[t]he court must not participate in [plea]\ndiscussions.” The second, Rule 11(h), states: “A variance\nfrom the requirements of th[e] rule is harmless error if\nit does not affect substantial rights.” Rule 52(a), which\ncovers trial court errors generally, similarly prescribes:\n“Any error . . . that does not affect substantial rights must\nbe disregarded.”\n   Anthony Davila, respondent here, entered a guilty plea\nto conspiracy to defraud the United States by filing false\nincome tax returns. He maintains that he did so because\na U. S. Magistrate Judge, at a pre-plea in camera hearing\nand in flagrant violation of Rule 11(c)(1), told him his best\ncourse, given the strength of the Government’s case, was\nto plead guilty. Three months later, Davila entered a plea\non advice of counsel. The hearing on Davila’s plea, con-\nducted by a U. S. District Judge, complied in all respects\nwith Rule 11.\n   The question presented is whether, as the Court of\n2                   UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit held, the violation of Rule\n11(c)(1) by the Magistrate Judge warranted automatic\nvacatur of Davila’s guilty plea. We hold that Rule 11(h)\ncontrols. Under the inquiry that Rule instructs, vacatur of\nthe plea is not in order if the record shows no prejudice to\nDavila’s decision to plead guilty.\n                               I\n   In May 2009, a federal grand jury in the Southern Dis-\ntrict of Georgia returned a 34-count indictment against\nrespondent Anthony Davila. The indictment charged that\nDavila filed over 120 falsified tax returns, receiving over\n$423,000 from the United States Treasury as a result of\nhis fraudulent scheme.\n   In January 2010, Davila sent a letter to the District\nCourt expressing dissatisfaction with his court-appointed\nattorney and requesting new counsel. His attorney, Davila\ncomplained, offered no defensive strategy, “ ‘never men-\ntioned a defense at all,’ ” but simply advised that he plead\nguilty.1 In response to Davila’s letter, a U. S. Magistrate\nJudge held an in camera hearing at which Davila and\nhis attorney, but no representative of the United States,\nappeared. At the start of the hearing, the Magistrate\nJudge told Davila that he was free to represent himself,\nbut would not get another court-appointed attorney. See\nApp. 148.\n   Addressing Davila’s complaint that his attorney had\nadvised him to plead guilty, the Magistrate Judge told\nDavila that “oftentimes . . . that is the best advice a lawyer\ncan give his client.” Id., at 152. “In view of whatever the\nGovernment’s evidence in a case might be,” the judge\ncontinued,\n     “it might be a good idea for the Defendant to accept\n——————\n  1 See Brief for Appellee in No. 10–15319–I (CA11), p. 3 (quoting Rec-\n\nord (Exh.

The judge then urged Davila\nto cooperate in order to gain a downward departure from\nthe sentence indicated by the Federal Sentencing Guide-\nlines. “[T]ry to understand,” he counseled,\n     “the Government, they have all of the marbles in this\n    situation and they can file that . . . motion for [a]\n    downward departure from the guidelines if they want\n    to, you know, and the rules are constructed so that\n    nobody can force them to file that [motion] for you.\n    The only thing at your disposal that is entirely up to\n    you is the two or three level reduction for acceptance\n    of responsibility. That means you’ve got to go to the\n    cross. You’ve got to tell the probation officer every-\n    thing you did in this case regardless of how bad it\n    makes you appear to be because that is the way you\n    get that three-level reduction for acceptance, and be-\n    lieve me, Mr. Davila, someone with your criminal his-\n    tory needs a three-level reduction for acceptance.” Id.,\n    at 159–160.\n  Davila’s Sentencing Guidelines range, the Magistrate\nJudge said, would “probably [be] pretty bad because [his]\ncriminal history score would be so high.” Id., at 160. To\nreduce his sentencing exposure, the Magistrate Judge\nsuggested, Davila could “cooperate with the Government\nin this or in other cases.” Ibid. As the hearing concluded,\nthe judge again cautioned that “to get the [sentence] re-\n4                UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nduction for acceptance [of responsibility],” Davila had to\n“come to the cross”:\n     “[T]hat two- or three-level reduction for acceptance is\n    something that you have the key to and you can en-\n    sure that you get that reduction in sentence simply by\n    virtue of being forthcoming and not trying to make\n    yourself look like you really didn’t know what was go-\n    ing on. . . . You’ve got to go [to the cross] and you’ve\n    got to tell it all, Brother, and convince that probation\n    officer that you are being as open and honest with him\n    as you can possibly be because then he will go to the\n    [D]istrict [J]udge and he will say, you know, that\n    Davila guy, he’s got a long criminal history but when\n    we were in there talking about this case he gave it all\n    up so give him the two-level, give him the three-level\n    reduction.” Id., at 160–161.\n   Nearly a month after the in camera hearing, Davila filed\na motion demanding a speedy trial. The District Court set\na trial date for April 2010, which was continued at the\nGovernment’s request.\n   In May 2010, more than three months after the hearing\nbefore the Magistrate Judge, Davila agreed to plead guilty\nto the conspiracy charge in exchange for dismissal of the\nother 33 counts charged in the indictment. Davila entered\nhis guilty plea before a U. S. District Judge six days later.\nUnder oath, Davila stated that he had not been forced\nor pressured to plead guilty. Id., at 122. Davila did not\nmention the in camera hearing before the Magistrate\nJudge, and the record does not indicate whether the Dis-\ntrict Judge was aware that the pre-plea hearing had taken\nplace. See id., at 82–99, 115–125.\n   Before he was sentenced, Davila moved to vacate his\nplea and to dismiss the indictment. The reason for his\nplea, Davila asserted, was “strategic.” Id., at 58. Aware\nthat the prosecutor had a duty to disclose all information\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelevant to the court’s determination whether to accept\nthe plea bargain, he stated that his purpose in entering\nthe plea was to force the Government to acknowledge\ntimeframe errors made in the indictment. Id., at 58–59.\nBy pleading guilty, Davila said, he would make the court\naware that the prosecution was “vindictive.” Id., at 59.\n  The District Judge denied Davila’s motion. In so ruling,\nthe court observed that, at the plea hearing, Davila had\naffirmed that he was under no “pressure, threats, or prom-\nises, other than promises [made] by the government in the\nplea agreement.” Id., at 70. Furthermore, he had been\nfully advised of his rights and the consequences of his\nplea. Id., at 71. It was therefore clear to the District\nJudge, who had himself presided at the plea hearing, that\nDavila’s guilty plea “was knowing and voluntary.” Id., at\n72. In view of Davila’s extensive criminal history, the\ncourt sentenced him to a prison term of 115 months. Id.,\nat 75–77. Again, neither Davila nor the court mentioned\nthe in camera hearing conducted by the Magistrate Judge.\nId., at 55–80.\n  On appeal, Davila’s court-appointed attorney sought\nleave to withdraw from the case, asserting, in a brief filed\npursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U. S. 738 (1967),\nthat there were no issues of arguable merit to be raised on\nDavila’s behalf. The Eleventh Circuit denied counsel’s\nmotion without prejudice to renewal. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n6a–8a. It did so based on a discovery the appeals court\nmade upon “independent review” of the record. That\nreview “revealed an irregularity in the statements of a\nmagistrate judge, made during a hearing prior to Davila’s\nplea, which appeared to urge [him] to cooperate and be\ncandid about his criminal conduct to obtain favorable\nsentencing consequences.” Id., at 7a. The court requested\ncounsel to address whether the “irregularity” constituted\nreversible error under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n11(c)(1). Id., at 7a–8a.\n6                    UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Following the court’s instruction, counsel filed a brief\narguing that Davila’s plea should be set aside due to the\nMagistrate Judge’s comments. In response, the Govern-\nment conceded that those comments violated Rule 11(c)(1).\nEven so, the Government urged, given the three-month\ngap between the comments and the plea, and the fact that\na different judge presided over Davila’s plea and sentenc-\ning hearings, no adverse effect on Davila’s substantial\nrights could be demonstrated. Pursuant to Circuit prece-\ndent, the appeals court held that the Rule 11(c)(1) viola-\ntion required automatic vacatur of Davila’s guilty plea.\nUnder the Circuit’s “bright line rule,” the court explained,\nthere was no need to inquire whether the error was, in\nfact, prejudicial. 664 F. 3d 1355, 1359 (CA11 2011)\n(per curiam).\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict con-\ncerning the consequences of a Rule 11(c)(1) violation. 568\nU.

See Advisory Committee’s 1974 Note on\nSubd. (e)(1) of Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App.,\np. 1420 (1976 ed.) (hereinafter Advisory Committee’s 1974\nNote).3 As the Advisory Committee’s note explains, com-\nmentators had observed, prior to the amendment, that\njudicial participation in plea negotiations was “common\npractice.” Id., at 1420 (citing D. Newman, Conviction: The\nDetermination of Guilt or Innocence Without Trial 32–52,\n78–104 (1966); Note, Guilty Plea Bargaining: Compromises\nby Prosecutors to Secure Guilty Pleas, 112 U. Pa. L.\nRev. 865, 891, 905 (1964)). Nonetheless, the prohibition\nwas included out of concern that a defendant might be\ninduced to plead guilty rather than risk displeasing the\njudge who would preside at trial.

Moreover, the Advisory Committee antic-\nipated, barring judicial involvement in plea discussions\nwould facilitate objective assessments of the voluntariness\nof a defendant’s plea. Ibid.\n   Added as a part of the 1983 Amendment, Rule 11(h)\nprovides that “a variance from the requirements of [Rule\n11] is harmless error if it does not affect substantial\nrights.” Subsection (h), the Advisory Committee’s note\ninforms, “rejects the extreme sanction of automatic rever-\nsal” for Rule 11 violations and clarifies that Rule 52(a)’s\nharmlessness inquiry applies to plea errors.

(herein-\nafter Advisory Committee’s 1983 Note).\n   The addition of subsection (h) was prompted by lower\n——————\n  3 As originally enacted, the prohibition of court participation in plea\n\ndiscussions was found in Rule 11(e)(1). See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n11(e)(1) (1976).\n8                 UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt over-readings of McCarthy v. United States, 394\nU. S. 459 (1969). That decision called for vacatur of a\nguilty plea accepted by the trial court without any inquiry\ninto the defendant’s understanding of the nature of the\ncharge. The Advisory Committee explained that subsec-\ntion (h) would deter reading McCarthy “as meaning that\nthe general harmless error provision in Rule 52(a) cannot\nbe utilized with respect to Rule 11 proceedings.” Advisory\nCommittee’s 1983 Note 751. Substantial compliance with\nRule 11 would remain the requirement, but the new sub-\nsection would guard against exalting “ceremony . . . over\nsubstance.” Id., at 749.\n   For trial court errors generally, Rule 52(a) states that\n“[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not\naffect substantial rights must be disregarded.” Rule 11(h),\nas just noted, was designed to make it clear that Rule 11\nerrors are not excepted from that general Rule. Advisory\nCommittee’s 1983 Note 749. Rule 52, in addition to stat-\ning the “harmless-error rule” in subsection (a), also states,\nin subsection (b), the “plain-error rule,” applicable when a\ndefendant fails to object to the error in the trial court.\nRule 52(b) states: “A plain error that affects substantial\nrights may be considered even though it was not brought\nto the [trial] court’s attention.” When Rule 52(a)’s “harmless-\nerror rule” governs, the prosecution bears the burden of\nshowing harmlessness. See United States v. Vonn, 535\nU. S. 55, 62 (2002). When Rule 52(b) controls, the defend-\nant must show that the error affects substantial rights.\nIbid.\n   In two cases, United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, and\nUnited States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U. S. 74 (2004),\nthis Court clarified that a Rule 11 error may be of the Rule\n52(a) type, or it may be of the Rule 52(b) kind, depending\non when the error was raised. In Vonn, the judge who\nconducted the plea hearing failed to inform the defendant,\nas required by Rule 11, that he would have “the right to\n                   Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthe assistance of counsel” if he proceeded to trial. See Fed.\nRule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3) (2000).4 The defendant first\nobjected to the omission on appeal. We addressed the\nquestion “whether a defendant who lets Rule 11 error pass\nwithout objection in the trial court must carry the burdens\nof Rule 52(b) or whether even the silent defendant can put\nthe Government to the burden of proving the Rule 11 error\nharmless.” 535 U. S., at 58.\n   The Defendant in Vonn had urged that “importation of\n[Rule 52(a)’s] harmless-error standard into Rule 11(h)\nwithout its companion plain-error rule was meant to eli-\nminate a silent defendant’s burdens under . . . Rule 52(b).”\nId., at 63. This Court rejected the defendant’s argu-\nment and held that “a silent defendant has the burden\nto satisfy the plain-error rule.” Id., at 59.\n   In Dominguez Benitez, the Court addressed what the\nsilent defendant’s burden entailed. The judge presiding at\nthe plea hearing in that case failed to warn the defendant,\nas Rule 11(c)(3)(B) directs, that he would not be permitted\nto withdraw his guilty plea even if the court did not ac-\ncept the plea-bargained sentencing recommendation. 542\nU. S., at 79. As in Vonn, the error was first raised on\nappeal. 542 U. S., at 79. This Court again held that Rule\n52(b) was controlling. Id., at 82. Stressing “the particular\nimportance of the finality of guilty pleas,” ibid., the Court\nprescribed the standard a defendant complaining of a Rule\n11 violation must meet to show “plain error”: “[A] defend-\nant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea,\non the ground that the district court committed plain error\nunder Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that,\nbut for the error, he would not have entered the plea.” Id.,\nat 83.\n——————\n  4 The requirement that the judge inform the defendant that he has\n\n“the right to be represented by counsel” is currently found in Rule\n11(b)(1)(D).\n10               UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              III\n\n   In Davila’s case, the Government acknowledged in this\nCourt, as it did before the Eleventh Circuit, that the Mag-\nistrate Judge violated Rule 11(c)(1) by improperly partici-\npating in plea discussions. As the excerpts from the in\ncamera hearing, set out supra, at 2–4, show, there is no\nroom for doubt on that score. The Magistrate Judge’s\nrepeated exhortations to Davila to “tell it all” in order to\nobtain a more favorable sentence, see App. 157–160, were\nindeed beyond the pale.\n   Did that misconduct in itself demand vacatur of Davila’s\nplea, as the Eleventh Circuit held, or, as the Government\nurges, must a reviewing court consider all that transpired\nin the trial court in order to assess the impact of the error\non the defendant’s decision to plead guilty? We hold that\nthe latter inquiry is the one the Rules and our precedent\nrequire.\n   Davila contends that automatic vacatur, while inappro-\npriate for most Rule 11 violations, should attend conduct\nbanned by Rule 11(c)(1). He distinguishes plea-colloquy\nomissions, i.e., errors of the kind involved in Vonn and\nDominguez Benitez, from pre-plea exhortations to admit\nguilt. Plea-colloquy requirements come into play after a\ndefendant has agreed to plead guilty. The advice and\nquestions now specified in Rules 11(b) and 11(c)(3)(B),\nDavila observes, are designed to ensure that a defendant’s\nplea is fully informed and intelligently made. Errors or\nomissions in following Rule 11’s plea-colloquy instructions,\nDavila recognizes, are properly typed procedural, and are\ntherefore properly assessed under the harmless-error\ninstruction of Rule 11(h).\n   Rule 11(c)(1)’s prohibition on judicial participation in\nplea discussions, in contrast, becomes operative before a\ndefendant has decided whether to plead guilty or to stand\ntrial. The Rule serves a more basic purpose, Davila urges,\none “central to the proper functioning of the criminal\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprocess.” Brief for Respondent 18. Therefore, “the reme-\ndial analysis that applies to violations of . . . procedural\nprovisions does not and should not apply to th[is] distinct\nclass of error.” Id., at 16. Violations of Rule 11(c)(1),\nDavila elaborates, heighten the risk that a defendant’s\nplea will be coerced or pressured, and not genuinely an\nexercise of free will. When a judge conveys his belief that\npleading guilty would be to a defendant’s advantage,\nDavila adds, the judge becomes, in effect, a second prose-\ncutor, depriving the defendant of the impartial arbiter to\nwhich he is entitled. “Rule 11(c)(1)’s bright-line prohibi-\ntion on judicial exhortations to plead guilty,” Davila con-\ncludes, is “no mere procedural technicality,” id., at 21, for\nsuch exhortations inevitably and incurably infect the\nensuing pretrial process. Id., at 43.\n   Nothing in Rule 11’s text, however, indicates that the\nban on judicial involvement in plea discussions, if dishon-\nored, demands automatic vacatur of the plea without\nregard to case-specific circumstances. The prohibition\nappears in subsection (c), headed “Plea Agreement Proce-\ndure.” See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c). That subsection\naffirms that the prosecution and defense attorney (or the\ndefendant when proceeding pro se) “may discuss and reach\na plea agreement.” Rule 11(c)(1). Further, Rule 11(c)\ndescribes permissible types of plea agreements, see Rule\n11(c)(1)(A)–(C), and addresses the court’s consideration,\nacceptance, or rejection of a proffered agreement, see Rule\n11(c)(3)–(5).\n   In recommending the disallowance of judicial participa-\ntion in plea negotiations now contained in subsection\n(c)(1), the Advisory Committee stressed that a defendant\nmight be induced to plead guilty to avoid antagonizing the\njudge who would preside at trial. See Advisory Commit-\ntee’s 1974 Note 1420. But the Committee nowhere sug-\ngested that violation of Rule 11(c)(1) is necessarily an\nerror graver than, for example, the error in Dominguez\n12                  UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nBenitez, i.e., the failure to tell a defendant that the plea\nwould bind him even if the sentence imposed significantly\nexceeded in length the term of years stated in the plea\nbargain. As earlier noted, see supra, at 7, the Committee\npointed to commentary describing judicial engagement\nin plea bargaining as a once “common practice,”5 and it\nobserved that, in particular cases, questions may arise\n“[a]s to what . . . constitute[s] ‘participation.’ ” Advisory\nCommittee’s 1974 Note 1420.\n   In short, neither Rule 11 itself, nor the Advisory Com-\nmittee’s commentary on the Rule singles out any instruc-\ntion as more basic than others. And Rule 11(h), specifically\ndesigned to stop automatic vacaturs, calls for across-the-\nboard application of the harmless-error prescription\n(or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error rule). See\nsupra, at 7–8.\n   Rule 11(c)(1) was adopted as a prophylactic measure,\nsee supra, at 7, not one impelled by the Due Process\nClause or any other constitutional requirement. See 664\nF. 3d, at 1359 (recognizing that Rule 11(c)(1) is part of a\n“prophylactic scheme”). We have characterized as “struc-\ntural” “a very limited class of errors” that trigger automatic\nreversal because they undermine the fairness of a crim-\ninal proceeding as a whole. United States v. Marcus, 560\nU. S. 258, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4–5) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Errors of this kind include denial of\ncounsel of choice, denial of self-representation, denial of a\npublic trial, and failure to convey to a jury that guilt must\nbe proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 150 (2006) (rank-\ning “deprivation of the right to counsel of choice” as\n\n——————\n  5 For state provisions permitting at least some judicial participation\nin plea bargaining, see, e.g., N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §15A–1021(a) (Lexis\n2011); Idaho Crim. Rule 11(f) (2012); Vt. Rule Crim. Proc. 11 Reporter’s\nNotes (2003 and Supp. 2012).\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“ ‘structural error’ ”). Rule 11(c)(1) error does not belong in\nthat highly exceptional category. See Neder v. United\nStates, 527 U. S. 1, 7 (1999) (structural errors are “funda-\nmental constitutional errors that ‘defy analysis by “harm-\nless error” standards’ ” (quoting Arizona v. Fulminante,\n499 U. S. 279, 309 (1991)).\n    Had Davila’s guilty plea followed soon after the Magis-\ntrate Judge told Davila that pleading guilty might be “the\nbest advice” a lawyer could give him, see App. 152, this\ncase may not have warranted our attention. The automatic-\nvacatur rule would have remained erroneous, but the\nCourt of Appeals’ mistake might have been inconsequen-\ntial. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47 (Counsel for the Government\nacknowledged that if there is a “serious [Rule 11(c)(1)]\nerror,” and the defendant pleads guilty “right after that,”\nthe error would likely qualify as prejudicial). Our essen-\ntial point is that particular facts and circumstances mat-\nter. Three months distanced the in camera meeting with\nthe Magistrate Judge from Davila’s appearance before the\nDistrict Judge who examined and accepted his guilty plea\nand later sentenced him. Nothing in the record shows\nthat the District Judge knew of the in camera hearing.\nAfter conducting an exemplary Rule 11 colloquy, the judge\ninquired: “Mr. Davila, has anyone forced or pressured you\nto plead guilty today?,” to which Davila responded: “No,\nsir.” App. 122. At the time of the plea hearing, there was\nno blending of judicial and prosecutorial functions.\n    Given the opportunity to raise any questions he might\nhave about matters relating to his plea, Davila simply\naffirmed that he wished to plead guilty to the conspiracy\ncount. When he later explained why he elected to plead\nguilty, he said nothing of the Magistrate Judge’s exhorta-\ntions. Instead, he called the decision “strategic,” designed\nto get the prosecutor to correct misinformation about the\nconspiracy count. Id., at 58–59, 61. Rather than automat-\nically vacating Davila’s guilty plea because of the Rule\n14               UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n11(c)(1) violation, the Court of Appeals should have con-\nsidered whether it was reasonably probable that, but for\nthe Magistrate Judge’s exhortations, Davila would have\nexercised his right to go to trial. In answering that ques-\ntion, the Magistrate Judge’s comments should be assessed,\nnot in isolation, but in light of the full record.\n                            IV\n   The Court of Appeals did not engage in that full-record\nassessment here. Rather, the court cut off consideration of\nthe particular facts of Davila’s case upon concluding that\nthe Magistrate Judge’s comments violated Rule 11(c)(1).\nThat pretermission kept the court from reaching case-\nspecific arguments raised by the parties, including the\nGovernment’s assertion that Davila was not prejudiced by\nthe Magistrate Judge’s comments, and Davila’s contention\nthat the extraordinary circumstances his case presents\nshould allow his claim to be judged under the harmless-\nerror standard of Rule 52(a) rather than the plain-error\nstandard of Rule 52(b), the rule that ordinarily attends a\ndefendant’s failure to object to a Rule 11 violation. See\nsupra, at 8; 664 F. 3d, at 1358 (citing United States v.\nMoriarty, 429 F. 3d 1012, 1019 (CA11 2005) (per curiam)).\nHaving explained why automatic vacatur of a guilty plea\nis incompatible with Rule 11(h), see supra, at 11–13 and\nthis page, we leave all remaining issues to be addressed by\nthe Court of Appeals on remand.\n                     *     *    *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

A variance from the requirements\nof this rule is harmless error if it does not affect sub-\nstantial rights.” (Emphasis added.) As the Court recog-\nnizes, this rule “calls for across-the-board application of the\nharmless-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection,\nthe plain-error rule).” Ante, at 12. That is the beginning\nand the end of this case. We should not rely on the notes\nof the Advisory Committee to unearth Rule 11’s alleged\ndesign, for “[t]he Committee’s view is not authoritative”\nand the text of the Rule conclusively resolves the question\nbefore us.

Argued April 15, 2013—Decided June 13, 2013\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 governs guilty pleas. Rule\n  11(c)(1) instructs that “[t]he court must not participate in [plea] dis-\n  cussions,” and Rule 11(h) states that a “variance from the require-\n  ments of th[e] rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial\n  rights.” Rule 52(a), which covers trial court errors generally, similar-\n  ly prescribes: “Any error . . . that does not affect substantial rights\n  must be disregarded.”\n    Respondent Davila, while under indictment on multiple tax fraud\n  charges, wrote to the District Court, expressing dissatisfaction with\n  his court-appointed attorney. Complaining that his attorney offered\n  no defensive strategy, but simply advised him to plead guilty, Davila\n  requested new counsel. A Magistrate Judge held an in camera hear-\n  ing at which Davila and his attorney, but no representative of the\n  United States, appeared. At the hearing, the Magistrate Judge told\n  Davila that he would not get another court-appointed attorney and\n  that his best course, given the strength of the Government’s case,\n  was to plead guilty. More than three months later, Davila pleaded\n  guilty to a conspiracy charge in exchange for dismissal of 33 other\n  charges. He stated under oath before a U. S. District Judge that he\n  had not been forced or pressured to enter the plea, and he did not\n  mention the in camera hearing before the Magistrate Judge. Prior to\n  sentencing, however, Davila moved to vacate his plea and dismiss the\n  indictment, asserting that he had entered the plea for a “strategic”\n  reason, i.e., to force the Government to acknowledge errors in the in-\n  dictment. Finding that Davila’s plea had been knowing and volun-\n  tary, the District Judge denied the motion. Again, Davila said noth-\n  ing of the in camera hearing conducted by the Magistrate Judge. On\n  appeal, the Eleventh Circuit, following Circuit precedent, held that\n2                     UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    the Magistrate Judge’s violation of Rule 11(c)(1) required automatic\n    vacatur of Davila’s guilty plea, obviating any need to inquire whether\n    the error was prejudicial.\nHeld: Under Rule 11(h), vacatur of the plea is not in order if the record\n shows no prejudice to Davila’s decision to plead guilty. Pp. 7–14.\n    (a) Rule 11(c)(1)’s prohibition of judicial involvement in plea dis-\n cussions was included in the 1974 Amendment to the Rule out of con-\n cern that a defendant might be induced to plead guilty rather than\n risk antagonizing the judge who would preside at trial. Rule 11(h)\n was added in the 1983 Amendment to make clear that Rule 11 errors\n are not excepted from Rule 52(a)’s harmless-error inquiry. Rule 52\n also states, in subsection (b), that a “plain error that affects substan-\n tial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the\n [trial] court’s attention.” When Rule 52(a) governs, the prosecution\n has the burden of showing harmlessness, but when Rule 52(b) con-\n trols, the defendant must show that the error affects substantial\n rights. See United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 62.\n    As clarified in Vonn and United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542\n U. S. 74, Rule 11 error may be of the Rule 52(a) type or the Rule 52(b)\n kind, depending on when the error was raised. In Vonn, the judge\n who conducted the plea hearing failed to inform the defendant, as re-\n quired by Rule 11(c)(3), that he would have “the right to the assis-\n tance of counsel” if he proceeded to trial. The defendant first objected\n to the omission on appeal. This Court held that “a silent defendant\n has the burden to satisfy [Rule 52(b)’s] plain-error rule.” 535 U. S., at\n 59. In Dominguez Benitez, the error first raised on appeal was failure\n to warn the defendant, as Rule 11(c)(3)(B) instructs, that a plea could\n not be withdrawn even if the sentence imposed was higher than the\n plea-bargained sentence recommendation. The Court again held that\n Rule 52(b) controlled, and prescribed the standard a defendant silent\n until appeal must meet to show “plain error,” namely, “a reasonable\n probability that, but for the [Rule 11] error, he would not have en-\n tered the plea.” 542 U. S., at 83. Pp. 7–9.\n    (b) Here, the Magistrate Judge plainly violated Rule 11(c)(1) by ex-\n horting Davila to plead guilty. Davila contends that automatic vaca-\n tur, while inappropriate for most Rule 11 violations, should attend\n conduct banned by Rule 11(c)(1). He distinguishes plea-colloquy\n omissions, i.e., errors of the kind involved in Vonn and Dominguez\n Benitez, from pre-plea exhortations to admit guilt. The former come\n into play after a defendant has decided to plead guilty, the latter, be-\n fore a defendant has decided to plead guilty or to stand trial. Nothing\n in Rule 11’s text, however, indicates that the ban on judicial involve-\n ment in plea discussions, if dishonored, demands automatic vacatur\n without regard to case-specific circumstances. Nor does the Advisory\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Committee commentary single out any Rule 11 instruction as more\n  basic than others. And Rule 11(h), specifically designed to stop au-\n  tomatic vacaturs, calls for across-the-board application of the harm-\n  less-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error\n  rule).\n     Rule 11(c)(1) was adopted as a prophylactic measure, not one im-\n  pelled by the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional re-\n  quirement. Thus, violation of the Rule does not belong in the highly\n  exceptional category of structural errors—e.g., denial of counsel of\n  choice or denial of a public trial—that trigger automatic reversal be-\n  cause they undermine the fairness of the entire criminal proceeding.\n  United States v. Marcus, 560 U. S. 258, ___. Instead, in assessing\n  Rule 11 errors, a reviewing court must take account of all that tran-\n  spired in the trial court. Had Davila’s guilty plea followed soon after\n  the Magistrate Judge’s comments, the automatic-vacatur rule would\n  have remained erroneous. The Court of Appeals’ mistake in that re-\n  gard, however, might have been inconsequential, for the Magistrate\n  Judge’s exhortations, if they immediately elicited a plea, would likely\n  have qualified as prejudicial. Here, however, three months distanced\n  the in camera meeting conducted by the Magistrate Judge from Davi-\n  la’s appearance before the District Judge who examined and accepted\n  his guilty plea after an exemplary Rule 11 colloquy, at which Davila\n  had the opportunity to raise any questions he might have about mat-\n  ters relating to his plea. The Court of Appeals, therefore, should not\n  have assessed the Magistrate Judge’s comments in isolation. In-\n  stead, it should have considered, in light of the full record, whether it\n  was reasonably probable that, but for the Magistrate Judge’s com-\n  ments, Davila would have exercised his right to go to trial. Pp. 10–\n  14.\n     (c) The Court of Appeals, having concluded that the Magistrate\n  Judge’s comments violated Rule 11(c)(1), cut off further considera-\n  tion.

ANTHONY DAVILA\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 13, 2013]\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Crim-\ninal Procedure, which governs guilty pleas. Two provi-\nsions of that rule are key here. The first, Rule 11(c)(1),\ninstructs that “[t]he court must not participate in [plea]\ndiscussions.” The second, Rule 11(h), states: “A variance\nfrom the requirements of th[e] rule is harmless error if\nit does not affect substantial rights.” Rule 52(a), which\ncovers trial court errors generally, similarly prescribes:\n“Any error . . . that does not affect substantial rights must\nbe disregarded.”\n   Anthony Davila, respondent here, entered a guilty plea\nto conspiracy to defraud the United States by filing false\nincome tax returns. He maintains that he did so because\na U. S. Magistrate Judge, at a pre-plea in camera hearing\nand in flagrant violation of Rule 11(c)(1), told him his best\ncourse, given the strength of the Government’s case, was\nto plead guilty. Three months later, Davila entered a plea\non advice of counsel. The hearing on Davila’s plea, con-\nducted by a U. S. District Judge, complied in all respects\nwith Rule 11.\n   The question presented is whether, as the Court of\n2                   UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit held, the violation of Rule\n11(c)(1) by the Magistrate Judge warranted automatic\nvacatur of Davila’s guilty plea. We hold that Rule 11(h)\ncontrols. Under the inquiry that Rule instructs, vacatur of\nthe plea is not in order if the record shows no prejudice to\nDavila’s decision to plead guilty.\n                               I\n   In May 2009, a federal grand jury in the Southern Dis-\ntrict of Georgia returned a 34-count indictment against\nrespondent Anthony Davila. The indictment charged that\nDavila filed over 120 falsified tax returns, receiving over\n$423,000 from the United States Treasury as a result of\nhis fraudulent scheme.\n   In January 2010, Davila sent a letter to the District\nCourt expressing dissatisfaction with his court-appointed\nattorney and requesting new counsel. His attorney, Davila\ncomplained, offered no defensive strategy, “ ‘never men-\ntioned a defense at all,’ ” but simply advised that he plead\nguilty.1 In response to Davila’s letter, a U. S. Magistrate\nJudge held an in camera hearing at which Davila and\nhis attorney, but no representative of the United States,\nappeared. At the start of the hearing, the Magistrate\nJudge told Davila that he was free to represent himself,\nbut would not get another court-appointed attorney. See\nApp. 148.\n   Addressing Davila’s complaint that his attorney had\nadvised him to plead guilty, the Magistrate Judge told\nDavila that “oftentimes . . . that is the best advice a lawyer\ncan give his client.” Id., at 152. “In view of whatever the\nGovernment’s evidence in a case might be,” the judge\ncontinued,\n     “it might be a good idea for the Defendant to accept\n——————\n  1 See Brief for Appellee in No. 10–15319–I (CA11), p. 3 (quoting Rec-\n\nord (Exh.

The judge then urged Davila\nto cooperate in order to gain a downward departure from\nthe sentence indicated by the Federal Sentencing Guide-\nlines. “[T]ry to understand,” he counseled,\n     “the Government, they have all of the marbles in this\n    situation and they can file that . . . motion for [a]\n    downward departure from the guidelines if they want\n    to, you know, and the rules are constructed so that\n    nobody can force them to file that [motion] for you.\n    The only thing at your disposal that is entirely up to\n    you is the two or three level reduction for acceptance\n    of responsibility. That means you’ve got to go to the\n    cross. You’ve got to tell the probation officer every-\n    thing you did in this case regardless of how bad it\n    makes you appear to be because that is the way you\n    get that three-level reduction for acceptance, and be-\n    lieve me, Mr. Davila, someone with your criminal his-\n    tory needs a three-level reduction for acceptance.” Id.,\n    at 159–160.\n  Davila’s Sentencing Guidelines range, the Magistrate\nJudge said, would “probably [be] pretty bad because [his]\ncriminal history score would be so high.” Id., at 160. To\nreduce his sentencing exposure, the Magistrate Judge\nsuggested, Davila could “cooperate with the Government\nin this or in other cases.” Ibid. As the hearing concluded,\nthe judge again cautioned that “to get the [sentence] re-\n4                UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nduction for acceptance [of responsibility],” Davila had to\n“come to the cross”:\n     “[T]hat two- or three-level reduction for acceptance is\n    something that you have the key to and you can en-\n    sure that you get that reduction in sentence simply by\n    virtue of being forthcoming and not trying to make\n    yourself look like you really didn’t know what was go-\n    ing on. . . . You’ve got to go [to the cross] and you’ve\n    got to tell it all, Brother, and convince that probation\n    officer that you are being as open and honest with him\n    as you can possibly be because then he will go to the\n    [D]istrict [J]udge and he will say, you know, that\n    Davila guy, he’s got a long criminal history but when\n    we were in there talking about this case he gave it all\n    up so give him the two-level, give him the three-level\n    reduction.” Id., at 160–161.\n   Nearly a month after the in camera hearing, Davila filed\na motion demanding a speedy trial. The District Court set\na trial date for April 2010, which was continued at the\nGovernment’s request.\n   In May 2010, more than three months after the hearing\nbefore the Magistrate Judge, Davila agreed to plead guilty\nto the conspiracy charge in exchange for dismissal of the\nother 33 counts charged in the indictment. Davila entered\nhis guilty plea before a U. S. District Judge six days later.\nUnder oath, Davila stated that he had not been forced\nor pressured to plead guilty. Id., at 122. Davila did not\nmention the in camera hearing before the Magistrate\nJudge, and the record does not indicate whether the Dis-\ntrict Judge was aware that the pre-plea hearing had taken\nplace. See id., at 82–99, 115–125.\n   Before he was sentenced, Davila moved to vacate his\nplea and to dismiss the indictment. The reason for his\nplea, Davila asserted, was “strategic.” Id., at 58. Aware\nthat the prosecutor had a duty to disclose all information\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelevant to the court’s determination whether to accept\nthe plea bargain, he stated that his purpose in entering\nthe plea was to force the Government to acknowledge\ntimeframe errors made in the indictment. Id., at 58–59.\nBy pleading guilty, Davila said, he would make the court\naware that the prosecution was “vindictive.” Id., at 59.\n  The District Judge denied Davila’s motion. In so ruling,\nthe court observed that, at the plea hearing, Davila had\naffirmed that he was under no “pressure, threats, or prom-\nises, other than promises [made] by the government in the\nplea agreement.” Id., at 70. Furthermore, he had been\nfully advised of his rights and the consequences of his\nplea. Id., at 71. It was therefore clear to the District\nJudge, who had himself presided at the plea hearing, that\nDavila’s guilty plea “was knowing and voluntary.” Id., at\n72. In view of Davila’s extensive criminal history, the\ncourt sentenced him to a prison term of 115 months. Id.,\nat 75–77. Again, neither Davila nor the court mentioned\nthe in camera hearing conducted by the Magistrate Judge.\nId., at 55–80.\n  On appeal, Davila’s court-appointed attorney sought\nleave to withdraw from the case, asserting, in a brief filed\npursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U. S. 738 (1967),\nthat there were no issues of arguable merit to be raised on\nDavila’s behalf. The Eleventh Circuit denied counsel’s\nmotion without prejudice to renewal. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n6a–8a. It did so based on a discovery the appeals court\nmade upon “independent review” of the record. That\nreview “revealed an irregularity in the statements of a\nmagistrate judge, made during a hearing prior to Davila’s\nplea, which appeared to urge [him] to cooperate and be\ncandid about his criminal conduct to obtain favorable\nsentencing consequences.” Id., at 7a. The court requested\ncounsel to address whether the “irregularity” constituted\nreversible error under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n11(c)(1). Id., at 7a–8a.\n6                    UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Following the court’s instruction, counsel filed a brief\narguing that Davila’s plea should be set aside due to the\nMagistrate Judge’s comments. In response, the Govern-\nment conceded that those comments violated Rule 11(c)(1).\nEven so, the Government urged, given the three-month\ngap between the comments and the plea, and the fact that\na different judge presided over Davila’s plea and sentenc-\ning hearings, no adverse effect on Davila’s substantial\nrights could be demonstrated. Pursuant to Circuit prece-\ndent, the appeals court held that the Rule 11(c)(1) viola-\ntion required automatic vacatur of Davila’s guilty plea.\nUnder the Circuit’s “bright line rule,” the court explained,\nthere was no need to inquire whether the error was, in\nfact, prejudicial. 664 F. 3d 1355, 1359 (CA11 2011)\n(per curiam).\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict con-\ncerning the consequences of a Rule 11(c)(1) violation. 568\nU.

See Advisory Committee’s 1974 Note on\nSubd. (e)(1) of Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App.,\np. 1420 (1976 ed.) (hereinafter Advisory Committee’s 1974\nNote).3 As the Advisory Committee’s note explains, com-\nmentators had observed, prior to the amendment, that\njudicial participation in plea negotiations was “common\npractice.” Id., at 1420 (citing D. Newman, Conviction: The\nDetermination of Guilt or Innocence Without Trial 32–52,\n78–104 (1966); Note, Guilty Plea Bargaining: Compromises\nby Prosecutors to Secure Guilty Pleas, 112 U. Pa. L.\nRev. 865, 891, 905 (1964)). Nonetheless, the prohibition\nwas included out of concern that a defendant might be\ninduced to plead guilty rather than risk displeasing the\njudge who would preside at trial. Advisory Committee’s\n1974 Note 1420. Moreover, the Advisory Committee antic-\nipated, barring judicial involvement in plea discussions\nwould facilitate objective assessments of the voluntariness\nof a defendant’s plea. Ibid.\n   Added as a part of the 1983 Amendment, Rule 11(h)\nprovides that “a variance from the requirements of [Rule\n11] is harmless error if it does not affect substantial\nrights.” Subsection (h), the Advisory Committee’s note\ninforms, “rejects the extreme sanction of automatic rever-\nsal” for Rule 11 violations and clarifies that Rule 52(a)’s\nharmlessness inquiry applies to plea errors. Advisory\nCommittee’s 1983 Note on Subd. (h) of Fed. Rule Crim.\nProc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App., pp. 749, 751 (1988 ed.) (herein-\nafter Advisory Committee’s 1983 Note).\n   The addition of subsection (h) was prompted by lower\n——————\n  3 As originally enacted, the prohibition of court participation in plea\n\ndiscussions was found in Rule 11(e)(1). See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n11(e)(1) (1976).\n8                 UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt over-readings of McCarthy v. United States, 394\nU. S. 459 (1969). That decision called for vacatur of a\nguilty plea accepted by the trial court without any inquiry\ninto the defendant’s understanding of the nature of the\ncharge. The Advisory Committee explained that subsec-\ntion (h) would deter reading McCarthy “as meaning that\nthe general harmless error provision in Rule 52(a) cannot\nbe utilized with respect to Rule 11 proceedings.” Advisory\nCommittee’s 1983 Note 751. Substantial compliance with\nRule 11 would remain the requirement, but the new sub-\nsection would guard against exalting “ceremony . . . over\nsubstance.” Id., at 749.\n   For trial court errors generally, Rule 52(a) states that\n“[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not\naffect substantial rights must be disregarded.” Rule 11(h),\nas just noted, was designed to make it clear that Rule 11\nerrors are not excepted from that general Rule. Advisory\nCommittee’s 1983 Note 749. Rule 52, in addition to stat-\ning the “harmless-error rule” in subsection (a), also states,\nin subsection (b), the “plain-error rule,” applicable when a\ndefendant fails to object to the error in the trial court.\nRule 52(b) states: “A plain error that affects substantial\nrights may be considered even though it was not brought\nto the [trial] court’s attention.” When Rule 52(a)’s “harmless-\nerror rule” governs, the prosecution bears the burden of\nshowing harmlessness. See United States v. Vonn, 535\nU. S. 55, 62 (2002). When Rule 52(b) controls, the defend-\nant must show that the error affects substantial rights.\nIbid.\n   In two cases, United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, and\nUnited States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U. S. 74 (2004),\nthis Court clarified that a Rule 11 error may be of the Rule\n52(a) type, or it may be of the Rule 52(b) kind, depending\non when the error was raised. In Vonn, the judge who\nconducted the plea hearing failed to inform the defendant,\nas required by Rule 11, that he would have “the right to\n                   Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthe assistance of counsel” if he proceeded to trial. See Fed.\nRule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3) (2000).4 The defendant first\nobjected to the omission on appeal. We addressed the\nquestion “whether a defendant who lets Rule 11 error pass\nwithout objection in the trial court must carry the burdens\nof Rule 52(b) or whether even the silent defendant can put\nthe Government to the burden of proving the Rule 11 error\nharmless.” 535 U. S., at 58.\n   The Defendant in Vonn had urged that “importation of\n[Rule 52(a)’s] harmless-error standard into Rule 11(h)\nwithout its companion plain-error rule was meant to eli-\nminate a silent defendant’s burdens under . . . Rule 52(b).”\nId., at 63. This Court rejected the defendant’s argu-\nment and held that “a silent defendant has the burden\nto satisfy the plain-error rule.” Id., at 59.\n   In Dominguez Benitez, the Court addressed what the\nsilent defendant’s burden entailed. The judge presiding at\nthe plea hearing in that case failed to warn the defendant,\nas Rule 11(c)(3)(B) directs, that he would not be permitted\nto withdraw his guilty plea even if the court did not ac-\ncept the plea-bargained sentencing recommendation. 542\nU. S., at 79. As in Vonn, the error was first raised on\nappeal. 542 U. S., at 79. This Court again held that Rule\n52(b) was controlling. Id., at 82. Stressing “the particular\nimportance of the finality of guilty pleas,” ibid., the Court\nprescribed the standard a defendant complaining of a Rule\n11 violation must meet to show “plain error”: “[A] defend-\nant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea,\non the ground that the district court committed plain error\nunder Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that,\nbut for the error, he would not have entered the plea.” Id.,\nat 83.\n——————\n  4 The requirement that the judge inform the defendant that he has\n\n“the right to be represented by counsel” is currently found in Rule\n11(b)(1)(D).\n10               UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              III\n\n   In Davila’s case, the Government acknowledged in this\nCourt, as it did before the Eleventh Circuit, that the Mag-\nistrate Judge violated Rule 11(c)(1) by improperly partici-\npating in plea discussions. As the excerpts from the in\ncamera hearing, set out supra, at 2–4, show, there is no\nroom for doubt on that score. The Magistrate Judge’s\nrepeated exhortations to Davila to “tell it all” in order to\nobtain a more favorable sentence, see App. 157–160, were\nindeed beyond the pale.\n   Did that misconduct in itself demand vacatur of Davila’s\nplea, as the Eleventh Circuit held, or, as the Government\nurges, must a reviewing court consider all that transpired\nin the trial court in order to assess the impact of the error\non the defendant’s decision to plead guilty? We hold that\nthe latter inquiry is the one the Rules and our precedent\nrequire.\n   Davila contends that automatic vacatur, while inappro-\npriate for most Rule 11 violations, should attend conduct\nbanned by Rule 11(c)(1). He distinguishes plea-colloquy\nomissions, i.e., errors of the kind involved in Vonn and\nDominguez Benitez, from pre-plea exhortations to admit\nguilt. Plea-colloquy requirements come into play after a\ndefendant has agreed to plead guilty. The advice and\nquestions now specified in Rules 11(b) and 11(c)(3)(B),\nDavila observes, are designed to ensure that a defendant’s\nplea is fully informed and intelligently made. Errors or\nomissions in following Rule 11’s plea-colloquy instructions,\nDavila recognizes, are properly typed procedural, and are\ntherefore properly assessed under the harmless-error\ninstruction of Rule 11(h).\n   Rule 11(c)(1)’s prohibition on judicial participation in\nplea discussions, in contrast, becomes operative before a\ndefendant has decided whether to plead guilty or to stand\ntrial. The Rule serves a more basic purpose, Davila urges,\none “central to the proper functioning of the criminal\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprocess.” Brief for Respondent 18. Therefore, “the reme-\ndial analysis that applies to violations of . . . procedural\nprovisions does not and should not apply to th[is] distinct\nclass of error.” Id., at 16. Violations of Rule 11(c)(1),\nDavila elaborates, heighten the risk that a defendant’s\nplea will be coerced or pressured, and not genuinely an\nexercise of free will. When a judge conveys his belief that\npleading guilty would be to a defendant’s advantage,\nDavila adds, the judge becomes, in effect, a second prose-\ncutor, depriving the defendant of the impartial arbiter to\nwhich he is entitled. “Rule 11(c)(1)’s bright-line prohibi-\ntion on judicial exhortations to plead guilty,” Davila con-\ncludes, is “no mere procedural technicality,” id., at 21, for\nsuch exhortations inevitably and incurably infect the\nensuing pretrial process. Id., at 43.\n   Nothing in Rule 11’s text, however, indicates that the\nban on judicial involvement in plea discussions, if dishon-\nored, demands automatic vacatur of the plea without\nregard to case-specific circumstances. The prohibition\nappears in subsection (c), headed “Plea Agreement Proce-\ndure.” See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c). That subsection\naffirms that the prosecution and defense attorney (or the\ndefendant when proceeding pro se) “may discuss and reach\na plea agreement.” Rule 11(c)(1). Further, Rule 11(c)\ndescribes permissible types of plea agreements, see Rule\n11(c)(1)(A)–(C), and addresses the court’s consideration,\nacceptance, or rejection of a proffered agreement, see Rule\n11(c)(3)–(5).\n   In recommending the disallowance of judicial participa-\ntion in plea negotiations now contained in subsection\n(c)(1), the Advisory Committee stressed that a defendant\nmight be induced to plead guilty to avoid antagonizing the\njudge who would preside at trial. See Advisory Commit-\ntee’s 1974 Note 1420. But the Committee nowhere sug-\ngested that violation of Rule 11(c)(1) is necessarily an\nerror graver than, for example, the error in Dominguez\n12                  UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nBenitez, i.e., the failure to tell a defendant that the plea\nwould bind him even if the sentence imposed significantly\nexceeded in length the term of years stated in the plea\nbargain. As earlier noted, see supra, at 7, the Committee\npointed to commentary describing judicial engagement\nin plea bargaining as a once “common practice,”5 and it\nobserved that, in particular cases, questions may arise\n“[a]s to what . . . constitute[s] ‘participation.’ ” Advisory\nCommittee’s 1974 Note 1420.\n   In short, neither Rule 11 itself, nor the Advisory Com-\nmittee’s commentary on the Rule singles out any instruc-\ntion as more basic than others. And Rule 11(h), specifically\ndesigned to stop automatic vacaturs, calls for across-the-\nboard application of the harmless-error prescription\n(or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error rule). See\nsupra, at 7–8.\n   Rule 11(c)(1) was adopted as a prophylactic measure,\nsee supra, at 7, not one impelled by the Due Process\nClause or any other constitutional requirement. See 664\nF. 3d, at 1359 (recognizing that Rule 11(c)(1) is part of a\n“prophylactic scheme”). We have characterized as “struc-\ntural” “a very limited class of errors” that trigger automatic\nreversal because they undermine the fairness of a crim-\ninal proceeding as a whole. United States v. Marcus, 560\nU. S. 258, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4–5) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Errors of this kind include denial of\ncounsel of choice, denial of self-representation, denial of a\npublic trial, and failure to convey to a jury that guilt must\nbe proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 150 (2006) (rank-\ning “deprivation of the right to counsel of choice” as\n\n——————\n  5 For state provisions permitting at least some judicial participation\nin plea bargaining, see, e.g., N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §15A–1021(a) (Lexis\n2011); Idaho Crim. Rule 11(f) (2012); Vt. Rule Crim. Proc. 11 Reporter’s\nNotes (2003 and Supp. 2012).\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

United\nStates, 527 U. S. 1, 7 (1999) (structural errors are “funda-\nmental constitutional errors that ‘defy analysis by “harm-\nless error” standards’ ” (quoting Arizona v. Fulminante,\n499 U. S. 279, 309 (1991)).\n    Had Davila’s guilty plea followed soon after the Magis-\ntrate Judge told Davila that pleading guilty might be “the\nbest advice” a lawyer could give him, see App. 152, this\ncase may not have warranted our attention. The automatic-\nvacatur rule would have remained erroneous, but the\nCourt of Appeals’ mistake might have been inconsequen-\ntial. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47 (Counsel for the Government\nacknowledged that if there is a “serious [Rule 11(c)(1)]\nerror,” and the defendant pleads guilty “right after that,”\nthe error would likely qualify as prejudicial). Our essen-\ntial point is that particular facts and circumstances mat-\nter. Three months distanced the in camera meeting with\nthe Magistrate Judge from Davila’s appearance before the\nDistrict Judge who examined and accepted his guilty plea\nand later sentenced him. Nothing in the record shows\nthat the District Judge knew of the in camera hearing.\nAfter conducting an exemplary Rule 11 colloquy, the judge\ninquired: “Mr. Davila, has anyone forced or pressured you\nto plead guilty today?,” to which Davila responded: “No,\nsir.” App. 122. At the time of the plea hearing, there was\nno blending of judicial and prosecutorial functions.\n    Given the opportunity to raise any questions he might\nhave about matters relating to his plea, Davila simply\naffirmed that he wished to plead guilty to the conspiracy\ncount. When he later explained why he elected to plead\nguilty, he said nothing of the Magistrate Judge’s exhorta-\ntions. Instead, he called the decision “strategic,” designed\nto get the prosecutor to correct misinformation about the\nconspiracy count. Id., at 58–59, 61. Rather than automat-\nically vacating Davila’s guilty plea because of the Rule\n14               UNITED STATES v. DAVILA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n11(c)(1) violation, the Court of Appeals should have con-\nsidered whether it was reasonably probable that, but for\nthe Magistrate Judge’s exhortations, Davila would have\nexercised his right to go to trial. In answering that ques-\ntion, the Magistrate Judge’s comments should be assessed,\nnot in isolation, but in light of the full record.\n                            IV\n   The Court of Appeals did not engage in that full-record\nassessment here. Rather, the court cut off consideration of\nthe particular facts of Davila’s case upon concluding that\nthe Magistrate Judge’s comments violated Rule 11(c)(1).\nThat pretermission kept the court from reaching case-\nspecific arguments raised by the parties, including the\nGovernment’s assertion that Davila was not prejudiced by\nthe Magistrate Judge’s comments, and Davila’s contention\nthat the extraordinary circumstances his case presents\nshould allow his claim to be judged under the harmless-\nerror standard of Rule 52(a) rather than the plain-error\nstandard of Rule 52(b), the rule that ordinarily attends a\ndefendant’s failure to object to a Rule 11 violation. See\nsupra, at 8; 664 F. 3d, at 1358 (citing United States v.\nMoriarty, 429 F. 3d 1012, 1019 (CA11 2005) (per curiam)).\nHaving explained why automatic vacatur of a guilty plea\nis incompatible with Rule 11(h), see supra, at 11–13 and\nthis page, we leave all remaining issues to be addressed by\nthe Court of Appeals on remand.\n                     *     *    *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

That is\nbecause the text of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n11(h) says exactly that, in words whose meaning is crystal\nclear: “Harmless error. A variance from the requirements\nof this rule is harmless error if it does not affect sub-\nstantial rights.” (Emphasis added.) As the Court recog-\nnizes, this rule “calls for across-the-board application of the\nharmless-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection,\nthe plain-error rule).” Ante, at 12. That is the beginning\nand the end of this case. We should not rely on the notes\nof the Advisory Committee to unearth Rule 11’s alleged\ndesign, for “[t]he Committee’s view is not authoritative”\nand the text of the Rule conclusively resolves the question\nbefore us.
