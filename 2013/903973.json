Argued February 27, 2013—Decided June 20, 2013\nAn agreement between petitioners, American Express and a subsidiary,\n and respondents, merchants who accept American Express cards, re-\n quires all of their disputes to be resolved by arbitration and provides\n that there “shall be no right or authority for any Claims to be arbi-\n trated on a class action basis.” Respondents nonetheless filed a class\n action, claiming that petitioners violated §1 of the Sherman Act and\n seeking treble damages for the class under §4 of the Clayton Act. Pe-\n titioners moved to compel individual arbitration under the Federal\n Arbitration Act (FAA), but respondents countered that the cost of ex-\n pert analysis necessary to prove the antitrust claims would greatly\n exceed the maximum recovery for an individual plaintiff. The Dis-\n trict Court granted the motion and dismissed the lawsuits. The Se-\n cond Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that because of the pro-\n hibitive costs respondents would face if they had to arbitrate, the\n class-action waiver was unenforceable and arbitration could not pro-\n ceed. The Circuit stood by its reversal when this Court remanded in\n light of Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp., 559\n U. S. 662, which held that a party may not be compelled to submit to\n class arbitration absent an agreement to do so.\nHeld: The FAA does not permit courts to invalidate a contractual waiv-\n er of class arbitration on the ground that the plaintiff’s cost of indi-\n vidually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential\n recovery. Pp. 3–10.\n    (a) The FAA reflects the overarching principle that arbitration is a\n matter of contract. See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561\n U. S. ___, ___. Courts must “rigorously enforce” arbitration agree-\n ments according to their terms, Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd,\n2            AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v.

S. 213, 221, even for claims alleging a violation of a federal\n    statute, unless the FAA’s mandate has been “ ‘overridden by a contra-\n    ry congressional command,’ ” CompuCredit Corp. v. Greenwood, 565\n    U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 3–4.\n       (b) No contrary congressional command requires rejection of the\n    class-arbitration waiver here. The antitrust laws do not guarantee\n    an affordable procedural path to the vindication of every claim, see\n    Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525–526, or “evince an in-\n    tention to preclude a waiver” of class-action procedure, Mitsubishi\n    Motors Corp. v. Soler-Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628.\n    Nor does congressional approval of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\n    establish an entitlement to class proceedings for the vindication of\n    statutory rights. The Rule imposes stringent requirements for certi-\n    fication that exclude most claims, and this Court has rejected the as-\n    sertion that the class-notice requirement must be dispensed with be-\n    cause the “prohibitively high cost” of compliance would “frustrate\n    [plaintiff’s] attempt to vindicate the policies underlying the antitrust”\n    laws, Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 167–168, 175–176.\n    Pp. 4–5.\n       (c) The “effective vindication” exception that originated as dictum\n    in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S.\n    614, also does not invalidate the instant arbitration agreement. The\n    exception comes from a desire to prevent “prospective waiver of a\n    party’s right to pursue statutory remedies,” id., at 637, n. 19; but the\n    fact that it is not worth the expense involved in proving a statutory\n    remedy does not constitute the elimination of the right to pursue that\n    remedy. Cf. Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20,\n    32; Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U. S.\n    528, 530, 534. AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.

ITALIAN COLORS RESTAURANT ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 20, 2013] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We consider whether a contractual waiver of class arbi-\ntration is enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act\nwhen the plaintiff ’s cost of individually arbitrating a\nfederal statutory claim exceeds the potential recovery.\n                               I\n   Respondents are merchants who accept American Ex-\npress cards. Their agreement with petitioners—American\nExpress and a wholly owned subsidiary—contains a clause\nthat requires all disputes between the parties to be re-\nsolved by arbitration. The agreement also provides that\n“[t]here shall be no right or authority for any Claims to be\narbitrated on a class action basis.” In re American Express\nMerchants’ Litigation, 667 F. 3d 204, 209 (CA2 2012).\n   Respondents brought a class action against petitioners\nfor violations of the federal antitrust laws. According to\nrespondents, American Express used its monopoly power\nin the market for charge cards to force merchants to ac-\ncept credit cards at rates approximately 30% higher than\n2          AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS\n                       RESTAURANT                                           \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe fees for competing credit cards.1 This tying arrange-\nment, respondents said, violated §1 of the Sherman Act.\nThey sought treble damages for the class under §4 of the\nClayton Act.\n   Petitioners moved to compel individual arbitration\nunder the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1\net seq. In resisting the motion, respondents submitted a\ndeclaration from an economist who estimated that the cost\nof an expert analysis necessary to prove the antitrust\nclaims would be “at least several hundred thousand dol-\nlars, and might exceed $1 million,” while the maximum\nrecovery for an individual plaintiff would be $12,850, or\n$38,549 when trebled. App. 93. The District Court granted\nthe motion and dismissed the lawsuits. The Court of\nAppeals reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\nIt held that because respondents had established that\n“they would incur prohibitive costs if compelled to arbi-\ntrate under the class action waiver,” the waiver was un-\nenforceable and the arbitration could not proceed. In re\nAmerican Express Merchants’ Litigation, 554 F. 3d 300,\n315–316 (CA2 2009).\n   We granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and re-\nmanded for further consideration in light of Stolt-Nielsen\nS. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int’l Corp., 559 U. S. 662 (2010),\nwhich held that a party may not be compelled to submit to\nclass arbitration absent an agreement to do so. American\nExpress Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, 559 U. S. 1103\n(2010). The Court of Appeals stood by its reversal, stating\nthat its earlier ruling did not compel class arbitration.\nIn re American Express Merchants’ Litigation, 634 F. 3d\n187, 200 (CA2 2011). It then sua sponte reconsidered its\nruling in light of AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563\n——————\n  1 A charge card requires its holder to pay the full outstanding balance\n\nat the end of a billing cycle; a credit card requires payment of only a\nportion, with the balance subject to interest.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

S. ___ (2011), which held that the FAA pre-empted a\nstate law barring enforcement of a class-arbitration waiver.\nFinding AT&T Mobility inapplicable because it addressed\npre-emption, the Court of Appeals reversed for the third\ntime. 667 F. 3d, at 213. It then denied rehearing en\nbanc with five judges dissenting. In re American Express\nMerchants’ Litigation, 681 F. 3d 139 (CA2 2012). We\ngranted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2012), to consider the\nquestion “[w]hether the Federal Arbitration Act permits\ncourts . . . to invalidate arbitration agreements on the\nground that they do not permit class arbitration of a\nfederal-law claim,” Pet. for Cert. i.\n                             II\n  Congress enacted the FAA in response to widespread\njudicial hostility to arbitration. See AT&T Mobility,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 4). As relevant here, the Act\nprovides:\n       “A written provision in any maritime transaction or\n    contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce\n    to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter aris-\n    ing out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be valid,\n    irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds\n    as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any\n    contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2.\nThis text reflects the overarching principle that arbitra-\ntion is a matter of contract. See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc.\nv. Jackson, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 3). And\nconsistent with that text, courts must “rigorously enforce”\narbitration agreements according to their terms, Dean\nWitter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 221 (1985),\nincluding terms that “specify with whom [the parties]\nchoose to arbitrate their disputes,” Stolt-Nielsen, supra, at\n683, and “the rules under which that arbitration will be\nconducted,” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of\n4        AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v.

That holds true for claims that allege a viola-\ntion of a federal statute, unless the FAA’s mandate has\nbeen “ ‘overridden by a contrary congressional command.’ ”\nCompuCredit Corp. v. Greenwood, 565 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) (slip op., at 2–3) (quoting Shearson/American\nExpress Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226 (1987)).\n                                III\n   No contrary congressional command requires us to\nreject the waiver of class arbitration here. Respondents argue\nthat requiring them to litigate their claims individually—\nas they contracted to do—would contravene the policies\nof the antitrust laws. But the antitrust laws do not\nguarantee an affordable procedural path to the vindi-\ncation of every claim. Congress has taken some measures\nto facilitate the litigation of antitrust claims—for example,\nit enacted a multiplied-damages remedy. See 15 U. S. C.\n§15 (treble damages). In enacting such measures, Con-\ngress has told us that it is willing to go, in certain re-\nspects, beyond the normal limits of law in advancing its\ngoals of deterring and remedying unlawful trade practice.\nBut to say that Congress must have intended whatever\ndepartures from those normal limits advance antitrust\ngoals is simply irrational. “[N]o legislation pursues its\npurposes at all costs.” Rodriguez v. United States, 480\nU. S. 522, 525–526 (1987) (per curiam).\n   The antitrust laws do not “evinc[e] an intention to pre-\nclude a waiver” of class-action procedure. Mitsubishi\nMotors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S.\n614, 628 (1985). The Sherman and Clayton Acts make no\nmention of class actions. In fact, they were enacted dec-\nades before the advent of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n23, which was “designed to allow an exception to the usual\nrule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the\nindividual named parties only.” Califano v. Yamasaki,\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n442 U. S. 682, 700–701 (1979). The parties here agreed to\narbitrate pursuant to that “usual rule,” and it would be\nremarkable for a court to erase that expectation.\n   Nor does congressional approval of Rule 23 establish an\nentitlement to class proceedings for the vindication of\nstatutory rights. To begin with, it is likely that such an\nentitlement, invalidating private arbitration agreements\ndenying class adjudication, would be an “abridg[ment]” or\nmodif[ication]” of a “substantive right” forbidden to the\nRules, see 28 U. S. C. §2072(b). But there is no evidence of\nsuch an entitlement in any event. The Rule imposes\nstringent requirements for certification that in practice\nexclude most claims. And we have specifically rejected the\nassertion that one of those requirements (the class-notice\nrequirement) must be dispensed with because the “prohib-\nitively high cost” of compliance would “frustrate [plain-\ntiff ’s] attempt to vindicate the policies underlying the\nantitrust” laws. Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S.\n156, 166–168, 175–176 (1974). One might respond, per-\nhaps, that federal law secures a nonwaivable opportunity\nto vindicate federal policies by satisfying the procedural\nstrictures of Rule 23 or invoking some other informal class\nmechanism in arbitration. But we have already rejected\nthat proposition in AT&T Mobility, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9).\n                             IV\n  Our finding of no “contrary congressional command”\ndoes not end the case. Respondents invoke a judge-made\nexception to the FAA which, they say, serves to harmonize\ncompeting federal policies by allowing courts to invalidate\nagreements that prevent the “effective vindication” of a\nfederal statutory right. Enforcing the waiver of class\narbitration bars effective vindication, respondents con-\ntend, because they have no economic incentive to pursue\ntheir antitrust claims individually in arbitration.\n6           AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS\n                        RESTAURANT                                          \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   The “effective vindication” exception to which respond-\nents allude originated as dictum in Mitsubishi Motors,\nwhere we expressed a willingness to invalidate, on “public\npolicy” grounds, arbitration agreements that “operat[e] . . .\nas a prospective waiver of a party’s right to pursue statu-\ntory remedies.” 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19 (emphasis added).\nDismissing concerns that the arbitral forum was inade-\nquate, we said that “so long as the prospective litigant\neffectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in\nthe arbitral forum, the statute will continue to serve both\nits remedial and deterrent function.” Id., at 637. Subse-\nquent cases have similarly asserted the existence of an\n“effective vindication” exception, see, e.g., 14 Penn Plaza\nLLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. 247, 273–274 (2009); Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 28 (1991),\nbut have similarly declined to apply it to invalidate the\narbitration agreement at issue.2\n   And we do so again here. As we have described, the\nexception finds its origin in the desire to prevent “prospec-\ntive waiver of a party’s right to pursue statutory reme-\ndies,” Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 637, n. 19 (emphasis\nadded). That would certainly cover a provision in an\narbitration agreement forbidding the assertion of certain\nstatutory rights. And it would perhaps cover filing and\nadministrative fees attached to arbitration that are so\nhigh as to make access to the forum impracticable. See\n——————\n    2 Contraryto the dissent’s claim, post, at 8–9, and n. 3 (opinion of\nKAGAN, J.), the Court in Mitsubishi Motors did not hold that federal\nstatutory claims are subject to arbitration so long as the claimant may\neffectively vindicate his rights in the arbitral forum. The Court ex-\npressly stated that, “at this stage in the proceedings,” it had “no occa-\nsion to speculate” on whether the arbitration agreement’s potential\ndeprivation of a claimant’s right to pursue federal remedies may render\nthat agreement unenforceable. 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. Even the Court\nof Appeals in this case recognized the relevant language in Mitsubishi\nMotors as dicta. In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation, 667\nF. 3d 204, 214 (CA2 2012).\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nGreen Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U. S. 79,\n90 (2000) (“It may well be that the existence of large arbi-\ntration costs could preclude a litigant . . . from effectively\nvindicating her federal statutory rights”). But the fact\nthat it is not worth the expense involved in proving a\nstatutory remedy does not constitute the elimination of\nthe right to pursue that remedy. See 681 F. 3d, at 147\n(Jacobs, C. J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc).3 The class-action waiver merely limits arbitration\nto the two contracting parties. It no more eliminates those\nparties’ right to pursue their statutory remedy than did\nfederal law before its adoption of the class action for legal\nrelief in 1938, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U. S. C.,\np. 864 (1938 ed., Supp V); 7A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.\nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure §1752, p. 18 (3d ed.\n2005). Or, to put it differently, the individual suit that\nwas considered adequate to assure “effective vindication”\nof a federal right before adoption of class-action proce-\ndures did not suddenly become “ineffective vindication”\nupon their adoption.4\n——————\n  3 The dissent contends that a class-action waiver may deny a party’s\nright to pursue statutory remedies in the same way as a clause that\nbars a party from presenting economic testimony. See post, at 3, 9.\nThat is a false comparison for several reasons: To begin with, it is not a\ngiven that such a clause would constitute an impermissible waiver; we\nhave never considered the point. But more importantly, such a clause,\nassuming it makes vindication of the claim impossible, makes it impos-\nsible not just as a class action but even as an individual claim.\n   4 Who can disagree with the dissent’s assertion that “the effective-\n\nvindication rule asks about the world today, not the world as it might\nhave looked when Congress passed a given statute”? Post, at 12. But\ntime does not change the meaning of effectiveness, making ineffective\nvindication today what was effective vindication in the past. The\ndissent also says that the agreement bars other forms of cost sharing—\nexisting before the Sherman Act—that could provide effective vindica-\ntion. See post, at 11–12, and n. 5. Petitioners denied that, and that is\nnot what the Court of Appeals decision under review here held. It held\nthat, because other forms of cost sharing were not economically feasible\n8          AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS\n                       RESTAURANT                                        \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  A pair of our cases brings home the point. In Gilmer,\nsupra, we had no qualms in enforcing a class waiver in an\narbitration agreement even though the federal statute at\nissue, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, ex-\npressly permitted collective actions. We said that statutory\npermission did “ ‘not mean that individual attempts at\nconciliation were intended to be barred.’ ” Id., at 32. And\nin Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer,\n515 U. S. 528 (1995), we held that requiring arbitration in\na foreign country was compatible with the federal Car-\nriage of Goods by Sea Act. That legislation prohibited any\nagreement “ ‘relieving’ ” or “ ‘lessening’ ” the liability of a\ncarrier for damaged goods, id., at 530, 534 (quoting 46\nU. S. C. App. §1303(8) (1988 ed.))—which is close to codifi-\ncation of an “effective vindication” exception. The Court\nrejected the argument that the “inconvenience and costs of\nproceeding” abroad “lessen[ed]” the defendants’ liability,\nstating that “[i]t would be unwieldy and unsupported by\nthe terms or policy of the statute to require courts to pro-\nceed case by case to tally the costs and burdens to particu-\nlar plaintiffs in light of their means, the size of their\nclaims, and the relative burden on the carrier.” 515 U. S.,\nat 532, 536. Such a “tally[ing] [of] the costs and burdens”\nis precisely what the dissent would impose upon federal\ncourts here.\n  Truth to tell, our decision in AT&T Mobility all but\nresolves this case. There we invalidated a law condition-\ning enforcement of arbitration on the availability of class\nprocedure because that law “interfere[d] with fundamental\n—————— \n\n(“the only economically feasible means for . . . enforcing [respondents’] \n\nstatutory rights is via a class action”), the class-action waiver was\n\nunenforceable. 667 F. 3d, at 218 (emphasis added). (The dissent’s\n\nassertion to the contrary cites not the opinion on appeal here, but an\n\nearlier opinion that was vacated.

In this case, Italian Colors makes two arguments\nto support its conclusion that the arbitration agreement\nshould not be enforced. First, it contends that enforcing\nthe arbitration agreement “would contravene the policies\nof the antitrust laws.” Ante, at 4. Second, it contends that\na court may “invalidate agreements that prevent the ‘ef-\nfective vindication’ of a federal statutory right.” Ante, at 6.\nNeither argument “concern[s] whether the contract was\nproperly made,” Concepcion, supra, at ___ (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 5–6). Because Italian Colors\nhas not furnished “grounds . . . for the revocation of any\ncontract,” 9 U. S. C. §2, the arbitration agreement must\nbe enforced. Italian Colors voluntarily entered into a con-\ntract containing a bilateral arbitration provision. It can-\nnot now escape its obligations merely because the claim it\nwishes to bring might be economically infeasible.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

The owner of a small\nrestaurant (Italian Colors) thinks that American Express\n(Amex) has used its monopoly power to force merchants to\naccept a form contract violating the antitrust laws. The\nrestaurateur wants to challenge the allegedly unlawful\nprovision (imposing a tying arrangement), but the same\ncontract’s arbitration clause prevents him from doing so.\nThat term imposes a variety of procedural bars that would\nmake pursuit of the antitrust claim a fool’s errand. So if\nthe arbitration clause is enforceable, Amex has insulated\nitself from antitrust liability—even if it has in fact violated\nthe law. The monopolist gets to use its monopoly power to\ninsist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all\nlegal recourse.\n   And here is the nutshell version of today’s opinion,\nadmirably flaunted rather than camouflaged: Too darn\nbad.\n   That answer is a betrayal of our precedents, and of\nfederal statutes like the antitrust laws. Our decisions\nhave developed a mechanism—called the effective-\nvindication rule—to prevent arbitration clauses from\nchoking off a plaintiff ’s ability to enforce congressionally\n2        AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS \n\n                     RESTAURANT                                 \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\ncreated rights. That doctrine bars applying such a clause\nwhen (but only when) it operates to confer immunity from\npotentially meritorious federal claims. In so doing, the\nrule reconciles the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) with all\nthe rest of federal law—and indeed, promotes the most\nfundamental purposes of the FAA itself. As applied here,\nthe rule would ensure that Amex’s arbitration clause does\nnot foreclose Italian Colors from vindicating its right to\nredress antitrust harm.\n  The majority barely tries to explain why it reaches a\ncontrary result. It notes that we have not decided this\nexact case before—neglecting that the principle we have\nestablished fits this case hand in glove. And it concocts a\nspecial exemption for class-arbitration waivers—ignoring\nthat this case concerns much more than that. Through-\nout, the majority disregards our decisions’ central tenet:\nAn arbitration clause may not thwart federal law, ir-\nrespective of exactly how it does so. Because the Court\ntoday prevents the effective vindication of federal statutory\nrights, I respectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  Start with an uncontroversial proposition: We would\nrefuse to enforce an exculpatory clause insulating a com-\npany from antitrust liability—say, “Merchants may bring\nno Sherman Act claims”—even if that clause were con-\ntained in an arbitration agreement. See ante, at 6. Con-\ngress created the Sherman Act’s private cause of action\nnot solely to compensate individuals, but to promote “the\npublic interest in vigilant enforcement of the antitrust\nlaws.” Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp., 349 U. S.\n322, 329 (1955). Accordingly, courts will not enforce a\nprospective waiver of the right to gain redress for an\nantitrust injury, whether in an arbitration agreement or\nany other contract. See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\nChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 637, and n. 19\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n(1985). The same rule applies to other important federal\nstatutory rights. See 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556\nU. S. 247, 273 (2009) (Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct); Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O’Neil, 324 U. S. 697, 704\n(1945) (Fair Labor Standards Act). But its necessity is\nnowhere more evident than in the antitrust context.\nWithout the rule, a company could use its monopoly power\nto protect its monopoly power, by coercing agreement to\ncontractual terms eliminating its antitrust liability.\n   If the rule were limited to baldly exculpatory provi-\nsions, however, a monopolist could devise numerous ways\naround it. Consider several alternatives that a party\ndrafting an arbitration agreement could adopt to avoid\nantitrust liability, each of which would have the identical\neffect. On the front end: The agreement might set out-\nlandish filing fees or establish an absurd (e.g., one-day)\nstatute of limitations, thus preventing a claimant from\ngaining access to the arbitral forum. On the back end: The\nagreement might remove the arbitrator’s authority to\ngrant meaningful relief, so that a judgment gets the\nclaimant nothing worthwhile. And in the middle: The\nagreement might block the claimant from presenting the\nkind of proof that is necessary to establish the defendant’s\nliability—say, by prohibiting any economic testimony\n(good luck proving an antitrust claim without that!). Or\nelse the agreement might appoint as an arbitrator an\nobviously biased person—say, the CEO of Amex. The\npossibilities are endless—all less direct than an express\nexculpatory clause, but no less fatal. So the rule against\nprospective waivers of federal rights can work only if it\napplies not just to a contract clause explicitly barring a\nclaim, but to others that operate to do so.\n   And sure enough, our cases establish this proposition:\nAn arbitration clause will not be enforced if it prevents the\neffective vindication of federal statutory rights, however it\nachieves that result. The rule originated in Mitsubishi,\n4        AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS \n\n                     RESTAURANT                                \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nwhere we held that claims brought under the Sherman Act\nand other federal laws are generally subject to arbitration.\n473 U. S., at 628. By agreeing to arbitrate such a claim,\nwe explained, “a party does not forgo the substantive\nrights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their\nresolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.”\nIbid. But crucial to our decision was a limiting principle,\ndesigned to safeguard federal rights: An arbitration clause\nwill be enforced only “so long as the prospective litigant\neffectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in\nthe arbitral forum.” Id., at 637. If an arbitration provi-\nsion “operated . . . as a prospective waiver of a party’s\nright to pursue statutory remedies,” we emphasized, we\nwould “condemn[ ]” it. Id., at 637, n. 19. Similarly, we\nstated that such a clause should be “set[] aside” if “pro-\nceedings in the contractual forum will be so gravely diffi-\ncult” that the claimant “will for all practical purposes be\ndeprived of his day in court.” Id., at 632 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). And in the decades since Mitsubishi,\nwe have repeated its admonition time and again, instruct-\ning courts not to enforce an arbitration agreement that\neffectively (even if not explicitly) forecloses a plaintiff from\nremedying the violation of a federal statutory right. See\nGilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 28\n(1991); Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky\nReefer, 515 U. S. 528, 540 (1995); 14 Penn Plaza, 556 U. S.,\nat 266, 273–274.\n   Our decision in Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Ran-\ndolph, 531 U. S. 79 (2000), confirmed that this principle\napplies when an agreement thwarts federal law by making\narbitration prohibitively expensive. The plaintiff there\n(seeking relief under the Truth in Lending Act) argued\nthat an arbitration agreement was unenforceable be-\ncause it “create[d] a risk” that she would have to “bear\nprohibitive arbitration costs” in the form of high filing and\nadministrative fees. Id., at 90 (internal quotation marks\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nomitted). We rejected that contention, but not because we\ndoubted that such fees could prevent the effective vindica-\ntion of statutory rights. To the contrary, we invoked our\nrule from Mitsubishi, making clear that it applied to the\ncase before us. See 538 U. S., at 90. Indeed, we added a\nburden of proof: “[W]here, as here,” we held, a party as-\nserting a federal right “seeks to invalidate an arbitration\nagreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohib-\nitively expensive, that party bears the burden of showing\nthe likelihood of incurring such costs.” Id., at 92. Ran-\ndolph, we found, had failed to meet that burden: The\nevidence she offered was “too speculative.” Id., at 91. But\neven as we dismissed Randolph’s suit, we reminded courts\nto protect against arbitration agreements that make fed-\neral claims too costly to bring.\n   Applied as our precedents direct, the effective-\nvindication rule furthers the purposes not just of laws like\nthe Sherman Act, but of the FAA itself. That statute\nreflects a federal policy favoring actual arbitration—that\nis, arbitration as a streamlined “method of resolving dis-\nputes,” not as a foolproof way of killing off valid claims.\nRodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,\n490 U. S. 477, 481 (1989). Put otherwise: What the FAA\nprefers to litigation is arbitration, not de facto immunity.\nThe effective-vindication rule furthers the statute’s goals\nby ensuring that arbitration remains a real, not faux,\nmethod of dispute resolution. With the rule, companies\nhave good reason to adopt arbitral procedures that facili-\ntate efficient and accurate handling of complaints. With-\nout it, companies have every incentive to draft their\nagreements to extract backdoor waivers of statutory\nrights, making arbitration unavailable or pointless. So\ndown one road: More arbitration, better enforcement of\nfederal statutes. And down the other: Less arbitration,\npoorer enforcement of federal statutes. Which would you\nprefer? Or still more aptly: Which do you think Congress\n6        AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS\n                     RESTAURANT\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nwould?\n   The answer becomes all the more obvious given the\nlimits we have placed on the rule, which ensure that it\ndoes not diminish arbitration’s benefits. The rule comes\ninto play only when an agreement “operate[s] . . . as a\nprospective waiver”—that is, forecloses (not diminishes) a\nplaintiff ’s opportunity to gain relief for a statutory viola-\ntion. Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. So, for example,\nRandolph assessed whether fees in arbitration would be\n“prohibitive” (not high, excessive, or extravagant). 531\nU. S., at 90. Moreover, the plaintiff must make that show-\ning through concrete proof: “[S]peculative” risks, “un-\nfounded assumptions,” and “unsupported statements” will\nnot suffice. Id., at 90–91, and n. 6. With the inquiry that\nconfined and the evidentiary requirements that high,\ncourts have had no trouble assessing the matters the rule\nmakes relevant. And for almost three decades, courts\nhave followed our edict that arbitration clauses must\nusually prevail, declining to enforce them in only rare\ncases. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26–\n27. The effective-vindication rule has thus operated year\nin and year out without undermining, much less “de-\nstroy[ing],” the prospect of speedy dispute resolution that\narbitration secures. Ante, at 9.\n   And this is just the kind of case the rule was meant to\naddress. Italian Colors, as I have noted, alleges that\nAmex used its market power to impose a tying arrange-\nment in violation of the Sherman Act. The antitrust laws,\nall parties agree, provide the restaurant with a cause of\naction and give it the chance to recover treble damages.\nHere, that would mean Italian Colors could take home up\nto $38,549. But a problem looms. As this case comes to\nus, the evidence shows that Italian Colors cannot prevail\nin arbitration without an economic analysis defining the\nrelevant markets, establishing Amex’s monopoly power,\nshowing anticompetitive effects, and measuring damages.\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    7\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nAnd that expert report would cost between several hun-\ndred thousand and one million dollars.1 So the expense\ninvolved in proving the claim in arbitration is ten times\nwhat Italian Colors could hope to gain, even in a best-case\nscenario. That counts as a “prohibitive” cost, in Ran-\ndolph’s terminology, if anything does. No rational actor\nwould bring a claim worth tens of thousands of dollars\nif doing so meant incurring costs in the hundreds of\nthousands.\n   An arbitration agreement could manage such a mis-\nmatch in many ways, but Amex’s disdains them all. As\nthe Court makes clear, the contract expressly prohibits\nclass arbitration. But that is only part of the problem.2\nThe agreement also disallows any kind of joinder or con-\nsolidation of claims or parties. And more: Its confidential-\nity provision prevents Italian Colors from informally\narranging with other merchants to produce a common\nexpert report. And still more: The agreement precludes\nany shifting of costs to Amex, even if Italian Colors pre-\nvails. And beyond all that: Amex refused to enter into any\nstipulations that would obviate or mitigate the need for\n——————\n   1 The evidence relating to these costs comes from an affidavit submit-\n\nted by an economist experienced in proving similar antitrust claims.\nThe Second Circuit found that Amex “ha[d] brought no serious chal-\nlenge” to that factual showing. See, e.g., 667 F. 3d 204, 210 (2012).\nAnd in this Court, Amex conceded that Italian Colors would need an\nexpert economic report to prevail in arbitration. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n15. Perhaps that is not really true. A hallmark of arbitration is its use\nof procedures tailored to the type of dispute and amount in controversy;\nso arbitrators might properly decline to demand such a rigorous eviden-\ntiary showing in small antitrust cases. But that possibility cannot\ndisturb the factual premise on which this case comes to us, and which\nthe majority accepts: that Italian Colors’s tying claim is an ordinary\nkind of antitrust claim; and that it is worth about a tenth the cost of\narbitration.\n   2 The majority contends that the class-action waiver is the only part\n\nwe should consider. See ante, at 7–8, n. 4. I explain below why that\nassertion is wrong. See infra, at 11–12.\n8          AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS \n\n                       RESTAURANT                                         \n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nthe economic analysis. In short, the agreement as applied\nin this case cuts off not just class arbitration, but any\navenue for sharing, shifting, or shrinking necessary costs.\nAmex has put Italian Colors to this choice: Spend way,\nway, way more money than your claim is worth, or relin-\nquish your Sherman Act rights.\n   So contra the majority, the court below got this case\nright. Italian Colors proved what the plaintiff in Ran-\ndolph could not—that a standard-form agreement, taken\nas a whole, renders arbitration of a claim “prohibitively\nexpensive.” 531 U. S., at 92. The restaurant thus estab-\nlished that the contract “operate[s] . . . as a prospective\nwaiver,” and prevents the “effective[ ] . . . vindicat[ion]” of\nSherman Act rights. Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 637, and\nn. 19. I would follow our precedents and decline to compel\narbitration.\n                              II\n   The majority is quite sure that the effective-vindication\nrule does not apply here, but has precious little to say\nabout why. It starts by disparaging the rule as having\n“originated as dictum.” Ante, at 6. But it does not rest on\nthat swipe, and for good reason. As I have explained, see\nsupra, at 3–4, the rule began as a core part of Mitsubishi:\nWe held there that federal statutory claims are subject to\narbitration “so long as” the claimant “effectively may\nvindicate its [rights] in the arbitral forum.” 473 U. S., at\n637 (emphasis added). The rule thus served as an essen-\ntial condition of the decision’s holding.3 And in Randolph,\n——————\n   3 The majority is dead wrong when it says that Mitsubishi reserved\n\njudgment on “whether the arbitration agreement’s potential depriva-\ntion of a claimant’s right to pursue federal remedies may render that\nagreement unenforceable.” Ante, at 6, n. 2. What the Mitsubishi Court\nhad “no occasion to speculate on” was whether a particular agreement\nin fact eliminated the claimant’s federal rights. 473 U. S., at 673, n. 19.\nBut we stated expressly that if the agreement did so (as Amex’s does),\n                      Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)       9\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nwe provided a standard for applying the rule when a\nclaimant alleges “prohibitive costs” (“Where, as here,” etc.,\nsee supra, at 5), and we then applied that standard to the\nparties before us. So whatever else the majority might\nthink of the effective-vindication rule, it is not dictum.\n   The next paragraph of the Court’s decision (the third of\nPart IV) is the key: It contains almost the whole of the\nmajority’s effort to explain why the effective-vindication\nrule does not stop Amex from compelling arbitration. The\nmajority’s first move is to describe Mitsubishi and Ran-\ndolph as covering only discrete situations: The rule, the\nmajority asserts, applies to arbitration agreements that\neliminate the “right to pursue statutory remedies” by\n“forbidding the assertion” of the right (as addressed in\nMitsubishi) or imposing filing and administrative fees “so\nhigh as to make access to the forum impracticable” (as\naddressed in Randolph). Ante, at 6 (emphasis deleted;\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Those cases are not\nthis case, the majority says: Here, the agreement’s provi-\nsions went to the possibility of “proving a statutory rem-\nedy.” Ante, at 7.\n   But the distinction the majority proffers, which excludes\nproblems of proof, is one Mitsubishi and Randolph (and\nour decisions reaffirming them) foreclose. Those decisions\nestablish what in some quarters is known as a principle:\nWhen an arbitration agreement prevents the effective\nvindication of federal rights, a party may go to court.\nThat principle, by its nature, operates in diverse circum-\nstances—not just the ones that happened to come before the\nCourt. See supra, at 3–4. It doubtless covers the baldly\nexculpatory clause and prohibitive fees that the majority\nacknowledges would preclude an arbitration agreement’s\nenforcement. But so too it covers the world of other provi-\nsions a clever drafter might devise to scuttle even the most\n—————— \n\nwe would invalidate it. Ibid.; see supra, at 4. \n\n10        AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS \n\n                      RESTAURANT                                           \n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nmeritorious federal claims. Those provisions might deny\nentry to the forum in the first instance. Or they might\ndeprive the claimant of any remedy. Or they might pre-\nvent the claimant from offering the necessary proof to\nprevail, as in my “no economic testimony” hypothetical—\nand in the actual circumstances of this case. See supra, at\n3. The variations matter not at all. Whatever the precise\nmechanism, each “operate[s] . . . as a prospective waiver of\na party’s [federal] right[s]”—and so confers immunity on a\nwrongdoer. Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. And that\nis what counts under our decisions.4\n   Nor can the majority escape the principle we have estab-\nlished by observing, as it does at one point, that Amex’s\nagreement merely made arbitration “not worth the ex-\npense.” Ante, at 7. That suggestion, after all, runs smack\ninto Randolph, which likewise involved an allegation that\narbitration, as specified in a contract, “would be prohibi-\ntively expensive.” 531 U. S., at 92. Our decision there\nmade clear that a provision raising a plaintiff ’s costs could\nforeclose consideration of federal claims, and so run afoul\nof the effective-vindication rule. The expense at issue in\nRandolph came from a filing fee combined with a per-diem\npayment for the arbitrator. But nothing about those\nparticular costs is distinctive; and indeed, a rule confined\nto them would be weirdly idiosyncratic. Not surprisingly,\nthen, Randolph gave no hint of distinguishing among the\ndifferent ways an arbitration agreement can make a claim\n\n——————\n  4 Gilmer and Vimar Seguros, which the majority relies on, see ante, at\n\n8, fail to advance its argument. The plaintiffs there did not claim, as\nItalian Colors does, that an arbitration clause altogether precluded\nthem from vindicating their federal rights. They averred only that\narbitration would be less convenient or effective than a proceeding in\ncourt. See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.

As I have explained, that kind of showing does\nnot meet the effective-vindication rule’s high bar. See supra, at 6.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Its rationale applies whenever an\nagreement makes the vindication of federal claims impos-\nsibly expensive—whether by imposing fees or proscribing\ncost-sharing or adopting some other device.\n   That leaves the three last sentences in the majority’s\ncore paragraph. Here, the majority conjures a special\nreason to exclude “class-action waiver[s]” from the effective-\nvindication rule’s compass. Ante, at 7–8, and n. 4.\nRule 23, the majority notes, became law only in 1938—\ndecades after the Sherman Act. The majority’s conclusion:\nIf federal law in the interim decades did not eliminate a\nplaintiff ’s rights under that Act, then neither does this\nagreement.\n   But that notion, first of all, rests on a false premise: that\nthis case is only about a class-action waiver. See ante, at\n7, n. 4 (confining the case to that issue). It is not, and\nindeed could not sensibly be. The effective-vindication\nrule asks whether an arbitration agreement as a whole\nprecludes a claimant from enforcing federal statutory\nrights. No single provision is properly viewed in isolation,\nbecause an agreement can close off one avenue to pursue a\nclaim while leaving others open. In this case, for example,\nthe agreement could have prohibited class arbitration\nwithout offending the effective-vindication rule if it had\nprovided an alternative mechanism to share, shift, or\nreduce the necessary costs. The agreement’s problem is\nthat it bars not just class actions, but also all mecha-\nnisms—many existing long before the Sherman Act, if that\nmatters—for joinder or consolidation of claims, informal\ncoordination among individual claimants, or amelioration\nof arbitral expenses. See supra, at 7. And contrary to the\nmajority’s assertion, the Second Circuit well understood\nthat point: It considered, for example, whether Italian\nColors could shift expert expenses to Amex if its claim\nprevailed (no) or could join with merchants bringing simi-\nlar claims to produce a common expert report (no again).\n12         AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS \n\n                       RESTAURANT                                             \n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nSee 554 F. 3d 300, 318 (2009). It is only in this Court that\nthe case has become strangely narrow, as the majority\nstares at a single provision rather than considering, in the\nway the effective-vindication rule demands, how the entire\ncontract operates.5\n   In any event, the age of the relevant procedural mecha-\nnisms (whether class actions or any other) does not mat-\nter, because the effective-vindication rule asks about the\nworld today, not the world as it might have looked when\nCongress passed a given statute. Whether a particular\nprocedural device preceded or post-dated a particular\nstatute, the question remains the same: Does the arbi-\ntration agreement foreclose a party—right now—from\neffectively vindicating the substantive rights the statute\nprovides? This case exhibits a whole raft of changes since\nCongress passed the Sherman Act, affecting both parties\nto the dispute—not just new procedural rules (like Rule\n23), but also new evidentiary requirements (like the\ndemand here for an expert report) and new contract provi-\nsions affecting arbitration (like this agreement’s confiden-\ntiality clause). But what has stayed the same is this:\nCongress’s intent that antitrust plaintiffs should be able to\nenforce their rights free of any prior waiver. See supra, at\n2–3; Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. The effective-\nvindication rule carries out that purpose by ensuring that\n——————\n  5 In defense of this focus, the majority quotes the Second Circuit as\n\nconcluding that “the only economically feasible means” for Italian\nColors to enforce its statutory rights “is via a class action.” Ante, at 7–\n8, n. 4 (quoting 667 F. 3d, at 218; internal quotation marks omitted;\nemphasis added by the Court). But the Court of Appeals reached that\nconclusion only after finding that the agreement prohibited all other\nforms of cost-sharing and cost-shifting. See 554 F. 3d 300, 318 (2009).\n(That opinion was vacated on other grounds, but its analysis continued\nto inform—indeed, was essential to—the Second Circuit’s final decision\nin the case. See 667 F. 3d, at 218.) The Second Circuit therefore did\nexactly what the majority refuses to do—look to the agreement as a\nwhole to determine whether it permits the vindication of federal rights.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            13\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nany arbitration agreement operating as such a waiver is\nunenforceable. And that requires courts to determine in\nthe here and now—rather than in ye olde glory days—\nwhether an agreement’s provisions foreclose even merito-\nrious antitrust claims.\n   Still, the majority takes one last stab: “Truth to tell,” it\nclaims, AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U. S. ___\n(2011), “all but resolves this case.” Ante, at 8. In that\ndecision, the majority recounts, this Court held that the\nFAA preempted a state “law conditioning enforcement of\narbitration on the availability of class procedure.” Ibid.;\nsee 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). According to the ma-\njority, that decision controls here because “[w]e specifically\nrejected the argument that class arbitration was neces-\nsary.” Ante, at 9.\n   Where to begin? Well, maybe where I just left off:\nItalian Colors is not claiming that a class action is\nnecessary—only that it have some means of vindicating a\nmeritorious claim. And as I have shown, non-class options\nabound. See supra, at 11. The idea that AT&T Mobility\ncontrols here depends entirely on the majority’s view that\nthis case is “class action or bust.” Were the majority to\ndrop that pretense, it could make no claim for AT&T\nMobility’s relevance.\n   And just as this case is not about class actions, AT&T\nMobility was not—and could not have been—about the\neffective-vindication rule. Here is a tip-off: AT&T Mobility\nnowhere cited our effective-vindication precedents. That\nwas so for two reasons. To begin with, the state law in\nquestion made class-action waivers unenforceable even\nwhen a party could feasibly vindicate her claim in an\nindividual arbitration. The state rule was designed to\npreserve the broad-scale “deterrent effects of class ac-\ntions,” not merely to protect a particular plaintiff ’s right\nto assert her own claim. 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).\nIndeed, the Court emphasized that the complaint in that\n14       AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS \n\n                     RESTAURANT                               \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\ncase was “most unlikely to go unresolved” because AT&T’s\nagreement contained a host of features ensuring that\n“aggrieved customers who filed claims would be essentially\nguaranteed to be made whole.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n17–18) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\nSo the Court professed that AT&T Mobility did not impli-\ncate the only thing (a party’s ability to vindicate a merito-\nrious claim) this case involves.\n  And if that is not enough, AT&T Mobility involved a\nstate law, and therefore could not possibly implicate the\neffective-vindication rule. When a state rule allegedly\nconflicts with the FAA, we apply standard preemption\nprinciples, asking whether the state law frustrates the\nFAA’s purposes and objectives. If the state rule does so—\nas the Court found in AT&T Mobility—the Supremacy\nClause requires its invalidation. We have no earthly\ninterest (quite the contrary) in vindicating that law. Our\neffective-vindication rule comes into play only when the\nFAA is alleged to conflict with another federal law, like\nthe Sherman Act here. In that all-federal context, one law\ndoes not automatically bow to the other, and the effective-\nvindication rule serves as a way to reconcile any tension\nbetween them. Again, then, AT&T Mobility had no occa-\nsion to address the issue in this case. The relevant deci-\nsions are instead Mitsubishi and Randolph.\n                        *     *    *\n   The Court today mistakes what this case is about. To a\nhammer, everything looks like a nail. And to a Court bent\non diminishing the usefulness of Rule 23, everything looks\nlike a class action, ready to be dismantled. So the Court\ndoes not consider that Amex’s agreement bars not just\nclass actions, but “other forms of cost-sharing . . . that\ncould provide effective vindication.” Ante, at 7, n. 4. In\nshort, the Court does not consider—and does not decide—\nItalian Colors’s (and similarly situated litigants’) actual\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          15\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nargument about why the effective-vindication rule pre-\ncludes this agreement’s enforcement.\n   As a result, Amex’s contract will succeed in depriving\nItalian Colors of any effective opportunity to challenge\nmonopolistic conduct allegedly in violation of the Sherman\nAct. The FAA, the majority says, so requires. Do not be\nfooled. Only the Court so requires; the FAA was never\nmeant to produce this outcome. The FAA conceived of\narbitration as a “method of resolving disputes”—a way of\nusing tailored and streamlined procedures to facilitate\nredress of injuries. Rodriguez de Quijas, 490 U. S., at 481\n(emphasis added). In the hands of today’s majority, arbi-\ntration threatens to become more nearly the opposite—a\nmechanism easily made to block the vindication of merito-\nrious federal claims and insulate wrongdoers from liabil-\nity. The Court thus undermines the FAA no less than it\ndoes the Sherman Act and other federal statutes providing\nrights of action. I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 903973, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/06/20/american_express_co._v._italian_colors_restaurant.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2012                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued February 27, 2013—Decided June 20, 2013\nAn agreement between petitioners, American Express and a subsidiary,\n and respondents, merchants who accept American Express cards, re-\n quires all of their disputes to be resolved by arbitration and provides\n that there “shall be no right or authority for any Claims to be arbi-\n trated on a class action basis.” Respondents nonetheless filed a class\n action, claiming that petitioners violated §1 of the Sherman Act and\n seeking treble damages for the class under §4 of the Clayton Act. Pe-\n titioners moved to compel individual arbitration under the Federal\n Arbitration Act (FAA), but respondents countered that the cost of ex-\n pert analysis necessary to prove the antitrust claims would greatly\n exceed the maximum recovery for an individual plaintiff. The Dis-\n trict Court granted the motion and dismissed the lawsuits. The Se-\n cond Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that because of the pro-\n hibitive costs respondents would face if they had to arbitrate, the\n class-action waiver was unenforceable and arbitration could not pro-\n ceed. The Circuit stood by its reversal when this Court remanded in\n light of Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp., 559\n U. S. 662, which held that a party may not be compelled to submit to\n class arbitration absent an agreement to do so.\nHeld: The FAA does not permit courts to invalidate a contractual waiv-\n er of class arbitration on the ground that the plaintiff’s cost of indi-\n vidually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential\n recovery. Pp. 3–10.\n    (a) The FAA reflects the overarching principle that arbitration is a\n matter of contract. See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561\n U. S. ___, ___.

Greenwood, 565\n    U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 3–4.\n       (b) No contrary congressional command requires rejection of the\n    class-arbitration waiver here. The antitrust laws do not guarantee\n    an affordable procedural path to the vindication of every claim, see\n    Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525–526, or “evince an in-\n    tention to preclude a waiver” of class-action procedure, Mitsubishi\n    Motors Corp. v. Soler-Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628.\n    Nor does congressional approval of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\n    establish an entitlement to class proceedings for the vindication of\n    statutory rights. The Rule imposes stringent requirements for certi-\n    fication that exclude most claims, and this Court has rejected the as-\n    sertion that the class-notice requirement must be dispensed with be-\n    cause the “prohibitively high cost” of compliance would “frustrate\n    [plaintiff’s] attempt to vindicate the policies underlying the antitrust”\n    laws, Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 167–168, 175–176.\n    Pp. 4–5.\n       (c) The “effective vindication” exception that originated as dictum\n    in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S.\n    614, also does not invalidate the instant arbitration agreement. The\n    exception comes from a desire to prevent “prospective waiver of a\n    party’s right to pursue statutory remedies,” id., at 637, n. 19; but the\n    fact that it is not worth the expense involved in proving a statutory\n    remedy does not constitute the elimination of the right to pursue that\n    remedy.

According to\nrespondents, American Express used its monopoly power\nin the market for charge cards to force merchants to ac-\ncept credit cards at rates approximately 30% higher than\n2          AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v.

S. C. §1\net seq. In resisting the motion, respondents submitted a\ndeclaration from an economist who estimated that the cost\nof an expert analysis necessary to prove the antitrust\nclaims would be “at least several hundred thousand dol-\nlars, and might exceed $1 million,” while the maximum\nrecovery for an individual plaintiff would be $12,850, or\n$38,549 when trebled. App. 93. The District Court granted\nthe motion and dismissed the lawsuits. The Court of\nAppeals reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\nIt held that because respondents had established that\n“they would incur prohibitive costs if compelled to arbi-\ntrate under the class action waiver,” the waiver was un-\nenforceable and the arbitration could not proceed. In re\nAmerican Express Merchants’ Litigation, 554 F. 3d 300,\n315–316 (CA2 2009).\n   We granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and re-\nmanded for further consideration in light of Stolt-Nielsen\nS.

Respondents argue\nthat requiring them to litigate their claims individually—\nas they contracted to do—would contravene the policies\nof the antitrust laws. But the antitrust laws do not\nguarantee an affordable procedural path to the vindi-\ncation of every claim. Congress has taken some measures\nto facilitate the litigation of antitrust claims—for example,\nit enacted a multiplied-damages remedy. See 15 U. S. C.\n§15 (treble damages). In enacting such measures, Con-\ngress has told us that it is willing to go, in certain re-\nspects, beyond the normal limits of law in advancing its\ngoals of deterring and remedying unlawful trade practice.\nBut to say that Congress must have intended whatever\ndepartures from those normal limits advance antitrust\ngoals is simply irrational. “[N]o legislation pursues its\npurposes at all costs.” Rodriguez v. United States, 480\nU. S. 522, 525–526 (1987) (per curiam).\n   The antitrust laws do not “evinc[e] an intention to pre-\nclude a waiver” of class-action procedure. Mitsubishi\nMotors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S.\n614, 628 (1985). The Sherman and Clayton Acts make no\nmention of class actions. In fact, they were enacted dec-\nades before the advent of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n23, which was “designed to allow an exception to the usual\nrule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the\nindividual named parties only.” Califano v. Yamasaki,\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n442 U. S. 682, 700–701 (1979). The parties here agreed to\narbitrate pursuant to that “usual rule,” and it would be\nremarkable for a court to erase that expectation.\n   Nor does congressional approval of Rule 23 establish an\nentitlement to class proceedings for the vindication of\nstatutory rights. To begin with, it is likely that such an\nentitlement, invalidating private arbitration agreements\ndenying class adjudication, would be an “abridg[ment]” or\nmodif[ication]” of a “substantive right” forbidden to the\nRules, see 28 U. S. C. §2072(b). But there is no evidence of\nsuch an entitlement in any event. The Rule imposes\nstringent requirements for certification that in practice\nexclude most claims. And we have specifically rejected the\nassertion that one of those requirements (the class-notice\nrequirement) must be dispensed with because the “prohib-\nitively high cost” of compliance would “frustrate [plain-\ntiff ’s] attempt to vindicate the policies underlying the\nantitrust” laws. Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S.\n156, 166–168, 175–176 (1974). One might respond, per-\nhaps, that federal law secures a nonwaivable opportunity\nto vindicate federal policies by satisfying the procedural\nstrictures of Rule 23 or invoking some other informal class\nmechanism in arbitration. But we have already rejected\nthat proposition in AT&T Mobility, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9).\n                             IV\n  Our finding of no “contrary congressional command”\ndoes not end the case. Respondents invoke a judge-made\nexception to the FAA which, they say, serves to harmonize\ncompeting federal policies by allowing courts to invalidate\nagreements that prevent the “effective vindication” of a\nfederal statutory right. Enforcing the waiver of class\narbitration bars effective vindication, respondents con-\ntend, because they have no economic incentive to pursue\ntheir antitrust claims individually in arbitration.\n6           AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS\n                        RESTAURANT                                          \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   The “effective vindication” exception to which respond-\nents allude originated as dictum in Mitsubishi Motors,\nwhere we expressed a willingness to invalidate, on “public\npolicy” grounds, arbitration agreements that “operat[e] . . .\nas a prospective waiver of a party’s right to pursue statu-\ntory remedies.” 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19 (emphasis added).\nDismissing concerns that the arbitral forum was inade-\nquate, we said that “so long as the prospective litigant\neffectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in\nthe arbitral forum, the statute will continue to serve both\nits remedial and deterrent function.” Id., at 637. Subse-\nquent cases have similarly asserted the existence of an\n“effective vindication” exception, see, e.g., 14 Penn Plaza\nLLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. 247, 273–274 (2009); Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 28 (1991),\nbut have similarly declined to apply it to invalidate the\narbitration agreement at issue.2\n   And we do so again here. As we have described, the\nexception finds its origin in the desire to prevent “prospec-\ntive waiver of a party’s right to pursue statutory reme-\ndies,” Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 637, n. 19 (emphasis\nadded). That would certainly cover a provision in an\narbitration agreement forbidding the assertion of certain\nstatutory rights. And it would perhaps cover filing and\nadministrative fees attached to arbitration that are so\nhigh as to make access to the forum impracticable. See\n——————\n    2 Contraryto the dissent’s claim, post, at 8–9, and n. 3 (opinion of\nKAGAN, J.), the Court in Mitsubishi Motors did not hold that federal\nstatutory claims are subject to arbitration so long as the claimant may\neffectively vindicate his rights in the arbitral forum. The Court ex-\npressly stated that, “at this stage in the proceedings,” it had “no occa-\nsion to speculate” on whether the arbitration agreement’s potential\ndeprivation of a claimant’s right to pursue federal remedies may render\nthat agreement unenforceable. 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. Even the Court\nof Appeals in this case recognized the relevant language in Mitsubishi\nMotors as dicta. In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation, 667\nF. 3d 204, 214 (CA2 2012).\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

S. 79,\n90 (2000) (“It may well be that the existence of large arbi-\ntration costs could preclude a litigant . . . from effectively\nvindicating her federal statutory rights”). But the fact\nthat it is not worth the expense involved in proving a\nstatutory remedy does not constitute the elimination of\nthe right to pursue that remedy. See 681 F. 3d, at 147\n(Jacobs, C. J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc).3 The class-action waiver merely limits arbitration\nto the two contracting parties. It no more eliminates those\nparties’ right to pursue their statutory remedy than did\nfederal law before its adoption of the class action for legal\nrelief in 1938, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U. S. C.,\np. 864 (1938 ed., Supp V); 7A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.\nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure §1752, p. 18 (3d ed.\n2005). Or, to put it differently, the individual suit that\nwas considered adequate to assure “effective vindication”\nof a federal right before adoption of class-action proce-\ndures did not suddenly become “ineffective vindication”\nupon their adoption.4\n——————\n  3 The dissent contends that a class-action waiver may deny a party’s\nright to pursue statutory remedies in the same way as a clause that\nbars a party from presenting economic testimony. See post, at 3, 9.\nThat is a false comparison for several reasons: To begin with, it is not a\ngiven that such a clause would constitute an impermissible waiver; we\nhave never considered the point. But more importantly, such a clause,\nassuming it makes vindication of the claim impossible, makes it impos-\nsible not just as a class action but even as an individual claim.\n   4 Who can disagree with the dissent’s assertion that “the effective-\n\nvindication rule asks about the world today, not the world as it might\nhave looked when Congress passed a given statute”? Post, at 12. But\ntime does not change the meaning of effectiveness, making ineffective\nvindication today what was effective vindication in the past. The\ndissent also says that the agreement bars other forms of cost sharing—\nexisting before the Sherman Act—that could provide effective vindica-\ntion. See post, at 11–12, and n. 5. Petitioners denied that, and that is\nnot what the Court of Appeals decision under review here held. It held\nthat, because other forms of cost sharing were not economically feasible\n8          AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS\n                       RESTAURANT                                        \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  A pair of our cases brings home the point. In Gilmer,\nsupra, we had no qualms in enforcing a class waiver in an\narbitration agreement even though the federal statute at\nissue, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, ex-\npressly permitted collective actions. We said that statutory\npermission did “ ‘not mean that individual attempts at\nconciliation were intended to be barred.’ ” Id., at 32. And\nin Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer,\n515 U. S. 528 (1995), we held that requiring arbitration in\na foreign country was compatible with the federal Car-\nriage of Goods by Sea Act. That legislation prohibited any\nagreement “ ‘relieving’ ” or “ ‘lessening’ ” the liability of a\ncarrier for damaged goods, id., at 530, 534 (quoting 46\nU. S. C. App. §1303(8) (1988 ed.))—which is close to codifi-\ncation of an “effective vindication” exception. The Court\nrejected the argument that the “inconvenience and costs of\nproceeding” abroad “lessen[ed]” the defendants’ liability,\nstating that “[i]t would be unwieldy and unsupported by\nthe terms or policy of the statute to require courts to pro-\nceed case by case to tally the costs and burdens to particu-\nlar plaintiffs in light of their means, the size of their\nclaims, and the relative burden on the carrier.” 515 U. S.,\nat 532, 536. Such a “tally[ing] [of] the costs and burdens”\nis precisely what the dissent would impose upon federal\ncourts here.\n  Truth to tell, our decision in AT&T Mobility all but\nresolves this case. There we invalidated a law condition-\ning enforcement of arbitration on the availability of class\nprocedure because that law “interfere[d] with fundamental\n—————— \n\n(“the only economically feasible means for . . . enforcing [respondents’] \n\nstatutory rights is via a class action”), the class-action waiver was\n\nunenforceable. 667 F. 3d, at 218 (emphasis added). (The dissent’s\n\nassertion to the contrary cites not the opinion on appeal here, but an\n\nearlier opinion that was vacated. See In re American Express Mer-\nchants’ Litigation, 554 F. 3d 300 (CA2 2009), vacated and remanded,\n\n559 U. S. 1103 (2010).)

Such a\npreliminary litigating hurdle would undoubtedly destroy\nthe prospect of speedy resolution that arbitration in gen-\neral and bilateral arbitration in particular was meant to\nsecure.

The latter interest, we said, is “unrelated” to the FAA.\n563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17). Accordingly, the FAA does, contrary\nto the dissent’s assertion, see post, at 5, favor the absence of litigation\nwhen that is the consequence of a class-action waiver, since its “ ‘princi-\npal purpose’ ” is the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to\ntheir terms. 563 U.

I write separately to\nnote that the result here is also required by the plain\nmeaning of the Federal Arbitration Act. In AT&T Mobil-\nity LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U. S. ___ (2011), I explained\nthat “the FAA requires that an agreement to arbitrate be\nenforced unless a party successfully challenges the forma-\ntion of the arbitration agreement, such as by proving fraud\nor duress.” Id., at ___ (concurring opinion) (slip op.,\nat 1–2). In this case, Italian Colors makes two arguments\nto support its conclusion that the arbitration agreement\nshould not be enforced. First, it contends that enforcing\nthe arbitration agreement “would contravene the policies\nof the antitrust laws.” Ante, at 4. Second, it contends that\na court may “invalidate agreements that prevent the ‘ef-\nfective vindication’ of a federal statutory right.” Ante, at 6.\nNeither argument “concern[s] whether the contract was\nproperly made,” Concepcion, supra, at ___ (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 5–6). Because Italian Colors\nhas not furnished “grounds . . . for the revocation of any\ncontract,” 9 U. S. C. §2, the arbitration agreement must\nbe enforced. Italian Colors voluntarily entered into a con-\ntract containing a bilateral arbitration provision. It can-\nnot now escape its obligations merely because the claim it\nwishes to bring might be economically infeasible.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

The owner of a small\nrestaurant (Italian Colors) thinks that American Express\n(Amex) has used its monopoly power to force merchants to\naccept a form contract violating the antitrust laws. The\nrestaurateur wants to challenge the allegedly unlawful\nprovision (imposing a tying arrangement), but the same\ncontract’s arbitration clause prevents him from doing so.\nThat term imposes a variety of procedural bars that would\nmake pursuit of the antitrust claim a fool’s errand. So if\nthe arbitration clause is enforceable, Amex has insulated\nitself from antitrust liability—even if it has in fact violated\nthe law. The monopolist gets to use its monopoly power to\ninsist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all\nlegal recourse.\n   And here is the nutshell version of today’s opinion,\nadmirably flaunted rather than camouflaged: Too darn\nbad.\n   That answer is a betrayal of our precedents, and of\nfederal statutes like the antitrust laws. Our decisions\nhave developed a mechanism—called the effective-\nvindication rule—to prevent arbitration clauses from\nchoking off a plaintiff ’s ability to enforce congressionally\n2        AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS \n\n                     RESTAURANT                                 \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\ncreated rights. That doctrine bars applying such a clause\nwhen (but only when) it operates to confer immunity from\npotentially meritorious federal claims. In so doing, the\nrule reconciles the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) with all\nthe rest of federal law—and indeed, promotes the most\nfundamental purposes of the FAA itself. As applied here,\nthe rule would ensure that Amex’s arbitration clause does\nnot foreclose Italian Colors from vindicating its right to\nredress antitrust harm.\n  The majority barely tries to explain why it reaches a\ncontrary result. It notes that we have not decided this\nexact case before—neglecting that the principle we have\nestablished fits this case hand in glove. And it concocts a\nspecial exemption for class-arbitration waivers—ignoring\nthat this case concerns much more than that. Through-\nout, the majority disregards our decisions’ central tenet:\nAn arbitration clause may not thwart federal law, ir-\nrespective of exactly how it does so. Because the Court\ntoday prevents the effective vindication of federal statutory\nrights, I respectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  Start with an uncontroversial proposition: We would\nrefuse to enforce an exculpatory clause insulating a com-\npany from antitrust liability—say, “Merchants may bring\nno Sherman Act claims”—even if that clause were con-\ntained in an arbitration agreement. See ante, at 6. Con-\ngress created the Sherman Act’s private cause of action\nnot solely to compensate individuals, but to promote “the\npublic interest in vigilant enforcement of the antitrust\nlaws.” Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp., 349 U. S.\n322, 329 (1955). Accordingly, courts will not enforce a\nprospective waiver of the right to gain redress for an\nantitrust injury, whether in an arbitration agreement or\nany other contract. See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\nChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 637, and n. 19\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n(1985). The same rule applies to other important federal\nstatutory rights. See 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556\nU. S. 247, 273 (2009) (Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct); Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O’Neil, 324 U. S. 697, 704\n(1945) (Fair Labor Standards Act). But its necessity is\nnowhere more evident than in the antitrust context.\nWithout the rule, a company could use its monopoly power\nto protect its monopoly power, by coercing agreement to\ncontractual terms eliminating its antitrust liability.\n   If the rule were limited to baldly exculpatory provi-\nsions, however, a monopolist could devise numerous ways\naround it. Consider several alternatives that a party\ndrafting an arbitration agreement could adopt to avoid\nantitrust liability, each of which would have the identical\neffect. On the front end: The agreement might set out-\nlandish filing fees or establish an absurd (e.g., one-day)\nstatute of limitations, thus preventing a claimant from\ngaining access to the arbitral forum. On the back end: The\nagreement might remove the arbitrator’s authority to\ngrant meaningful relief, so that a judgment gets the\nclaimant nothing worthwhile. And in the middle: The\nagreement might block the claimant from presenting the\nkind of proof that is necessary to establish the defendant’s\nliability—say, by prohibiting any economic testimony\n(good luck proving an antitrust claim without that!). Or\nelse the agreement might appoint as an arbitrator an\nobviously biased person—say, the CEO of Amex. The\npossibilities are endless—all less direct than an express\nexculpatory clause, but no less fatal. So the rule against\nprospective waivers of federal rights can work only if it\napplies not just to a contract clause explicitly barring a\nclaim, but to others that operate to do so.\n   And sure enough, our cases establish this proposition:\nAn arbitration clause will not be enforced if it prevents the\neffective vindication of federal statutory rights, however it\nachieves that result. The rule originated in Mitsubishi,\n4        AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS \n\n                     RESTAURANT                                \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nwhere we held that claims brought under the Sherman Act\nand other federal laws are generally subject to arbitration.\n473 U. S., at 628. By agreeing to arbitrate such a claim,\nwe explained, “a party does not forgo the substantive\nrights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their\nresolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.”\nIbid. But crucial to our decision was a limiting principle,\ndesigned to safeguard federal rights: An arbitration clause\nwill be enforced only “so long as the prospective litigant\neffectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in\nthe arbitral forum.” Id., at 637. If an arbitration provi-\nsion “operated . . . as a prospective waiver of a party’s\nright to pursue statutory remedies,” we emphasized, we\nwould “condemn[ ]” it. Id., at 637, n. 19. Similarly, we\nstated that such a clause should be “set[] aside” if “pro-\nceedings in the contractual forum will be so gravely diffi-\ncult” that the claimant “will for all practical purposes be\ndeprived of his day in court.” Id., at 632 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). And in the decades since Mitsubishi,\nwe have repeated its admonition time and again, instruct-\ning courts not to enforce an arbitration agreement that\neffectively (even if not explicitly) forecloses a plaintiff from\nremedying the violation of a federal statutory right. See\nGilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 28\n(1991); Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky\nReefer, 515 U. S. 528, 540 (1995); 14 Penn Plaza, 556 U. S.,\nat 266, 273–274.\n   Our decision in Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Ran-\ndolph, 531 U. S. 79 (2000), confirmed that this principle\napplies when an agreement thwarts federal law by making\narbitration prohibitively expensive. The plaintiff there\n(seeking relief under the Truth in Lending Act) argued\nthat an arbitration agreement was unenforceable be-\ncause it “create[d] a risk” that she would have to “bear\nprohibitive arbitration costs” in the form of high filing and\nadministrative fees. Id., at 90 (internal quotation marks\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nomitted). We rejected that contention, but not because we\ndoubted that such fees could prevent the effective vindica-\ntion of statutory rights. To the contrary, we invoked our\nrule from Mitsubishi, making clear that it applied to the\ncase before us. See 538 U. S., at 90. Indeed, we added a\nburden of proof: “[W]here, as here,” we held, a party as-\nserting a federal right “seeks to invalidate an arbitration\nagreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohib-\nitively expensive, that party bears the burden of showing\nthe likelihood of incurring such costs.” Id., at 92. Ran-\ndolph, we found, had failed to meet that burden: The\nevidence she offered was “too speculative.” Id., at 91. But\neven as we dismissed Randolph’s suit, we reminded courts\nto protect against arbitration agreements that make fed-\neral claims too costly to bring.\n   Applied as our precedents direct, the effective-\nvindication rule furthers the purposes not just of laws like\nthe Sherman Act, but of the FAA itself. That statute\nreflects a federal policy favoring actual arbitration—that\nis, arbitration as a streamlined “method of resolving dis-\nputes,” not as a foolproof way of killing off valid claims.\nRodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,\n490 U. S. 477, 481 (1989). Put otherwise: What the FAA\nprefers to litigation is arbitration, not de facto immunity.\nThe effective-vindication rule furthers the statute’s goals\nby ensuring that arbitration remains a real, not faux,\nmethod of dispute resolution. With the rule, companies\nhave good reason to adopt arbitral procedures that facili-\ntate efficient and accurate handling of complaints. With-\nout it, companies have every incentive to draft their\nagreements to extract backdoor waivers of statutory\nrights, making arbitration unavailable or pointless. So\ndown one road: More arbitration, better enforcement of\nfederal statutes. And down the other: Less arbitration,\npoorer enforcement of federal statutes. Which would you\nprefer? Or still more aptly: Which do you think Congress\n6        AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS\n                     RESTAURANT\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nwould?\n   The answer becomes all the more obvious given the\nlimits we have placed on the rule, which ensure that it\ndoes not diminish arbitration’s benefits. The rule comes\ninto play only when an agreement “operate[s] . . . as a\nprospective waiver”—that is, forecloses (not diminishes) a\nplaintiff ’s opportunity to gain relief for a statutory viola-\ntion. Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. So, for example,\nRandolph assessed whether fees in arbitration would be\n“prohibitive” (not high, excessive, or extravagant). 531\nU. S., at 90. Moreover, the plaintiff must make that show-\ning through concrete proof: “[S]peculative” risks, “un-\nfounded assumptions,” and “unsupported statements” will\nnot suffice. Id., at 90–91, and n. 6. With the inquiry that\nconfined and the evidentiary requirements that high,\ncourts have had no trouble assessing the matters the rule\nmakes relevant. And for almost three decades, courts\nhave followed our edict that arbitration clauses must\nusually prevail, declining to enforce them in only rare\ncases. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26–\n27. The effective-vindication rule has thus operated year\nin and year out without undermining, much less “de-\nstroy[ing],” the prospect of speedy dispute resolution that\narbitration secures. Ante, at 9.\n   And this is just the kind of case the rule was meant to\naddress. Italian Colors, as I have noted, alleges that\nAmex used its market power to impose a tying arrange-\nment in violation of the Sherman Act. The antitrust laws,\nall parties agree, provide the restaurant with a cause of\naction and give it the chance to recover treble damages.\nHere, that would mean Italian Colors could take home up\nto $38,549. But a problem looms. As this case comes to\nus, the evidence shows that Italian Colors cannot prevail\nin arbitration without an economic analysis defining the\nrelevant markets, establishing Amex’s monopoly power,\nshowing anticompetitive effects, and measuring damages.\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    7\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nAnd that expert report would cost between several hun-\ndred thousand and one million dollars.1 So the expense\ninvolved in proving the claim in arbitration is ten times\nwhat Italian Colors could hope to gain, even in a best-case\nscenario. That counts as a “prohibitive” cost, in Ran-\ndolph’s terminology, if anything does. No rational actor\nwould bring a claim worth tens of thousands of dollars\nif doing so meant incurring costs in the hundreds of\nthousands.\n   An arbitration agreement could manage such a mis-\nmatch in many ways, but Amex’s disdains them all. As\nthe Court makes clear, the contract expressly prohibits\nclass arbitration. But that is only part of the problem.2\nThe agreement also disallows any kind of joinder or con-\nsolidation of claims or parties. And more: Its confidential-\nity provision prevents Italian Colors from informally\narranging with other merchants to produce a common\nexpert report. And still more: The agreement precludes\nany shifting of costs to Amex, even if Italian Colors pre-\nvails. And beyond all that: Amex refused to enter into any\nstipulations that would obviate or mitigate the need for\n——————\n   1 The evidence relating to these costs comes from an affidavit submit-\n\nted by an economist experienced in proving similar antitrust claims.\nThe Second Circuit found that Amex “ha[d] brought no serious chal-\nlenge” to that factual showing. See, e.g., 667 F. 3d 204, 210 (2012).\nAnd in this Court, Amex conceded that Italian Colors would need an\nexpert economic report to prevail in arbitration. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n15. Perhaps that is not really true. A hallmark of arbitration is its use\nof procedures tailored to the type of dispute and amount in controversy;\nso arbitrators might properly decline to demand such a rigorous eviden-\ntiary showing in small antitrust cases. But that possibility cannot\ndisturb the factual premise on which this case comes to us, and which\nthe majority accepts: that Italian Colors’s tying claim is an ordinary\nkind of antitrust claim; and that it is worth about a tenth the cost of\narbitration.\n   2 The majority contends that the class-action waiver is the only part\n\nwe should consider. See ante, at 7–8, n. 4. I explain below why that\nassertion is wrong. See infra, at 11–12.\n8          AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS \n\n                       RESTAURANT                                         \n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nthe economic analysis. In short, the agreement as applied\nin this case cuts off not just class arbitration, but any\navenue for sharing, shifting, or shrinking necessary costs.\nAmex has put Italian Colors to this choice: Spend way,\nway, way more money than your claim is worth, or relin-\nquish your Sherman Act rights.\n   So contra the majority, the court below got this case\nright. Italian Colors proved what the plaintiff in Ran-\ndolph could not—that a standard-form agreement, taken\nas a whole, renders arbitration of a claim “prohibitively\nexpensive.” 531 U. S., at 92. The restaurant thus estab-\nlished that the contract “operate[s] . . . as a prospective\nwaiver,” and prevents the “effective[ ] . . . vindicat[ion]” of\nSherman Act rights. Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 637, and\nn. 19. I would follow our precedents and decline to compel\narbitration.\n                              II\n   The majority is quite sure that the effective-vindication\nrule does not apply here, but has precious little to say\nabout why. It starts by disparaging the rule as having\n“originated as dictum.” Ante, at 6. But it does not rest on\nthat swipe, and for good reason. As I have explained, see\nsupra, at 3–4, the rule began as a core part of Mitsubishi:\nWe held there that federal statutory claims are subject to\narbitration “so long as” the claimant “effectively may\nvindicate its [rights] in the arbitral forum.” 473 U. S., at\n637 (emphasis added). The rule thus served as an essen-\ntial condition of the decision’s holding.3 And in Randolph,\n——————\n   3 The majority is dead wrong when it says that Mitsubishi reserved\n\njudgment on “whether the arbitration agreement’s potential depriva-\ntion of a claimant’s right to pursue federal remedies may render that\nagreement unenforceable.” Ante, at 6, n. 2. What the Mitsubishi Court\nhad “no occasion to speculate on” was whether a particular agreement\nin fact eliminated the claimant’s federal rights. 473 U. S., at 673, n. 19.\nBut we stated expressly that if the agreement did so (as Amex’s does),\n                      Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)       9\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nwe provided a standard for applying the rule when a\nclaimant alleges “prohibitive costs” (“Where, as here,” etc.,\nsee supra, at 5), and we then applied that standard to the\nparties before us. So whatever else the majority might\nthink of the effective-vindication rule, it is not dictum.\n   The next paragraph of the Court’s decision (the third of\nPart IV) is the key: It contains almost the whole of the\nmajority’s effort to explain why the effective-vindication\nrule does not stop Amex from compelling arbitration. The\nmajority’s first move is to describe Mitsubishi and Ran-\ndolph as covering only discrete situations: The rule, the\nmajority asserts, applies to arbitration agreements that\neliminate the “right to pursue statutory remedies” by\n“forbidding the assertion” of the right (as addressed in\nMitsubishi) or imposing filing and administrative fees “so\nhigh as to make access to the forum impracticable” (as\naddressed in Randolph). Ante, at 6 (emphasis deleted;\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Those cases are not\nthis case, the majority says: Here, the agreement’s provi-\nsions went to the possibility of “proving a statutory rem-\nedy.” Ante, at 7.\n   But the distinction the majority proffers, which excludes\nproblems of proof, is one Mitsubishi and Randolph (and\nour decisions reaffirming them) foreclose. Those decisions\nestablish what in some quarters is known as a principle:\nWhen an arbitration agreement prevents the effective\nvindication of federal rights, a party may go to court.\nThat principle, by its nature, operates in diverse circum-\nstances—not just the ones that happened to come before the\nCourt. See supra, at 3–4. It doubtless covers the baldly\nexculpatory clause and prohibitive fees that the majority\nacknowledges would preclude an arbitration agreement’s\nenforcement. But so too it covers the world of other provi-\nsions a clever drafter might devise to scuttle even the most\n—————— \n\nwe would invalidate it. Ibid.; see supra, at 4. \n\n10        AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS \n\n                      RESTAURANT                                           \n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nmeritorious federal claims. Those provisions might deny\nentry to the forum in the first instance. Or they might\ndeprive the claimant of any remedy. Or they might pre-\nvent the claimant from offering the necessary proof to\nprevail, as in my “no economic testimony” hypothetical—\nand in the actual circumstances of this case. See supra, at\n3. The variations matter not at all. Whatever the precise\nmechanism, each “operate[s] . . . as a prospective waiver of\na party’s [federal] right[s]”—and so confers immunity on a\nwrongdoer. Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. And that\nis what counts under our decisions.4\n   Nor can the majority escape the principle we have estab-\nlished by observing, as it does at one point, that Amex’s\nagreement merely made arbitration “not worth the ex-\npense.” Ante, at 7. That suggestion, after all, runs smack\ninto Randolph, which likewise involved an allegation that\narbitration, as specified in a contract, “would be prohibi-\ntively expensive.” 531 U. S., at 92. Our decision there\nmade clear that a provision raising a plaintiff ’s costs could\nforeclose consideration of federal claims, and so run afoul\nof the effective-vindication rule. The expense at issue in\nRandolph came from a filing fee combined with a per-diem\npayment for the arbitrator. But nothing about those\nparticular costs is distinctive; and indeed, a rule confined\nto them would be weirdly idiosyncratic. Not surprisingly,\nthen, Randolph gave no hint of distinguishing among the\ndifferent ways an arbitration agreement can make a claim\n\n——————\n  4 Gilmer and Vimar Seguros, which the majority relies on, see ante, at\n\n8, fail to advance its argument. The plaintiffs there did not claim, as\nItalian Colors does, that an arbitration clause altogether precluded\nthem from vindicating their federal rights. They averred only that\narbitration would be less convenient or effective than a proceeding in\ncourt. See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 31–\n32 (1991); Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515\nU. S. 528, 533 (1995). As I have explained, that kind of showing does\nnot meet the effective-vindication rule’s high bar. See supra, at 6.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             11\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ntoo costly to bring. Its rationale applies whenever an\nagreement makes the vindication of federal claims impos-\nsibly expensive—whether by imposing fees or proscribing\ncost-sharing or adopting some other device.\n   That leaves the three last sentences in the majority’s\ncore paragraph. Here, the majority conjures a special\nreason to exclude “class-action waiver[s]” from the effective-\nvindication rule’s compass. Ante, at 7–8, and n. 4.\nRule 23, the majority notes, became law only in 1938—\ndecades after the Sherman Act. The majority’s conclusion:\nIf federal law in the interim decades did not eliminate a\nplaintiff ’s rights under that Act, then neither does this\nagreement.\n   But that notion, first of all, rests on a false premise: that\nthis case is only about a class-action waiver. See ante, at\n7, n. 4 (confining the case to that issue). It is not, and\nindeed could not sensibly be. The effective-vindication\nrule asks whether an arbitration agreement as a whole\nprecludes a claimant from enforcing federal statutory\nrights. No single provision is properly viewed in isolation,\nbecause an agreement can close off one avenue to pursue a\nclaim while leaving others open. In this case, for example,\nthe agreement could have prohibited class arbitration\nwithout offending the effective-vindication rule if it had\nprovided an alternative mechanism to share, shift, or\nreduce the necessary costs. The agreement’s problem is\nthat it bars not just class actions, but also all mecha-\nnisms—many existing long before the Sherman Act, if that\nmatters—for joinder or consolidation of claims, informal\ncoordination among individual claimants, or amelioration\nof arbitral expenses. See supra, at 7. And contrary to the\nmajority’s assertion, the Second Circuit well understood\nthat point: It considered, for example, whether Italian\nColors could shift expert expenses to Amex if its claim\nprevailed (no) or could join with merchants bringing simi-\nlar claims to produce a common expert report (no again).\n12         AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS \n\n                       RESTAURANT                                             \n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nSee 554 F. 3d 300, 318 (2009). It is only in this Court that\nthe case has become strangely narrow, as the majority\nstares at a single provision rather than considering, in the\nway the effective-vindication rule demands, how the entire\ncontract operates.5\n   In any event, the age of the relevant procedural mecha-\nnisms (whether class actions or any other) does not mat-\nter, because the effective-vindication rule asks about the\nworld today, not the world as it might have looked when\nCongress passed a given statute. Whether a particular\nprocedural device preceded or post-dated a particular\nstatute, the question remains the same: Does the arbi-\ntration agreement foreclose a party—right now—from\neffectively vindicating the substantive rights the statute\nprovides? This case exhibits a whole raft of changes since\nCongress passed the Sherman Act, affecting both parties\nto the dispute—not just new procedural rules (like Rule\n23), but also new evidentiary requirements (like the\ndemand here for an expert report) and new contract provi-\nsions affecting arbitration (like this agreement’s confiden-\ntiality clause). But what has stayed the same is this:\nCongress’s intent that antitrust plaintiffs should be able to\nenforce their rights free of any prior waiver. See supra, at\n2–3; Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. The effective-\nvindication rule carries out that purpose by ensuring that\n——————\n  5 In defense of this focus, the majority quotes the Second Circuit as\n\nconcluding that “the only economically feasible means” for Italian\nColors to enforce its statutory rights “is via a class action.” Ante, at 7–\n8, n. 4 (quoting 667 F. 3d, at 218; internal quotation marks omitted;\nemphasis added by the Court). But the Court of Appeals reached that\nconclusion only after finding that the agreement prohibited all other\nforms of cost-sharing and cost-shifting. See 554 F. 3d 300, 318 (2009).\n(That opinion was vacated on other grounds, but its analysis continued\nto inform—indeed, was essential to—the Second Circuit’s final decision\nin the case. See 667 F. 3d, at 218.) The Second Circuit therefore did\nexactly what the majority refuses to do—look to the agreement as a\nwhole to determine whether it permits the vindication of federal rights.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            13\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nany arbitration agreement operating as such a waiver is\nunenforceable. And that requires courts to determine in\nthe here and now—rather than in ye olde glory days—\nwhether an agreement’s provisions foreclose even merito-\nrious antitrust claims.\n   Still, the majority takes one last stab: “Truth to tell,” it\nclaims, AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U. S. ___\n(2011), “all but resolves this case.” Ante, at 8. In that\ndecision, the majority recounts, this Court held that the\nFAA preempted a state “law conditioning enforcement of\narbitration on the availability of class procedure.” Ibid.;\nsee 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). According to the ma-\njority, that decision controls here because “[w]e specifically\nrejected the argument that class arbitration was neces-\nsary.” Ante, at 9.\n   Where to begin? Well, maybe where I just left off:\nItalian Colors is not claiming that a class action is\nnecessary—only that it have some means of vindicating a\nmeritorious claim. And as I have shown, non-class options\nabound. See supra, at 11. The idea that AT&T Mobility\ncontrols here depends entirely on the majority’s view that\nthis case is “class action or bust.” Were the majority to\ndrop that pretense, it could make no claim for AT&T\nMobility’s relevance.\n   And just as this case is not about class actions, AT&T\nMobility was not—and could not have been—about the\neffective-vindication rule. Here is a tip-off: AT&T Mobility\nnowhere cited our effective-vindication precedents. That\nwas so for two reasons. To begin with, the state law in\nquestion made class-action waivers unenforceable even\nwhen a party could feasibly vindicate her claim in an\nindividual arbitration. The state rule was designed to\npreserve the broad-scale “deterrent effects of class ac-\ntions,” not merely to protect a particular plaintiff ’s right\nto assert her own claim. 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).\nIndeed, the Court emphasized that the complaint in that\n14       AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. v. ITALIAN COLORS \n\n                     RESTAURANT                               \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\ncase was “most unlikely to go unresolved” because AT&T’s\nagreement contained a host of features ensuring that\n“aggrieved customers who filed claims would be essentially\nguaranteed to be made whole.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n17–18) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\nSo the Court professed that AT&T Mobility did not impli-\ncate the only thing (a party’s ability to vindicate a merito-\nrious claim) this case involves.\n  And if that is not enough, AT&T Mobility involved a\nstate law, and therefore could not possibly implicate the\neffective-vindication rule. When a state rule allegedly\nconflicts with the FAA, we apply standard preemption\nprinciples, asking whether the state law frustrates the\nFAA’s purposes and objectives. If the state rule does so—\nas the Court found in AT&T Mobility—the Supremacy\nClause requires its invalidation. We have no earthly\ninterest (quite the contrary) in vindicating that law. Our\neffective-vindication rule comes into play only when the\nFAA is alleged to conflict with another federal law, like\nthe Sherman Act here. In that all-federal context, one law\ndoes not automatically bow to the other, and the effective-\nvindication rule serves as a way to reconcile any tension\nbetween them. Again, then, AT&T Mobility had no occa-\nsion to address the issue in this case. The relevant deci-\nsions are instead Mitsubishi and Randolph.\n                        *     *    *\n   The Court today mistakes what this case is about. To a\nhammer, everything looks like a nail. And to a Court bent\non diminishing the usefulness of Rule 23, everything looks\nlike a class action, ready to be dismantled. So the Court\ndoes not consider that Amex’s agreement bars not just\nclass actions, but “other forms of cost-sharing . . . that\ncould provide effective vindication.” Ante, at 7, n. 4. In\nshort, the Court does not consider—and does not decide—\nItalian Colors’s (and similarly situated litigants’) actual\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          15\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nargument about why the effective-vindication rule pre-\ncludes this agreement’s enforcement.\n   As a result, Amex’s contract will succeed in depriving\nItalian Colors of any effective opportunity to challenge\nmonopolistic conduct allegedly in violation of the Sherman\nAct. The FAA, the majority says, so requires. Do not be\nfooled. Only the Court so requires; the FAA was never\nmeant to produce this outcome. The FAA conceived of\narbitration as a “method of resolving disputes”—a way of\nusing tailored and streamlined procedures to facilitate\nredress of injuries. Rodriguez de Quijas, 490 U. S., at 481\n(emphasis added). In the hands of today’s majority, arbi-\ntration threatens to become more nearly the opposite—a\nmechanism easily made to block the vindication of merito-\nrious federal claims and insulate wrongdoers from liabil-\nity. The Court thus undermines the FAA no less than it\ndoes the Sherman Act and other federal statutes providing\nrights of action.
