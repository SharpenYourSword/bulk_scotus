After an extensive series of\nstate- and federal-court proceedings concluded with this\nCourt’s denial of respondent’s petitions for certiorari and\nfor rehearing, the Ninth Circuit declined to issue its\nmandate as normally required by Federal Rule of Appel­\nlate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D). The Ninth Circuit instead,\nsua sponte, construed respondent’s motion to stay the\nmandate pending the Ninth Circuit’s decision in a sepa­\nrate en banc case as a motion to reconsider a motion that\nit had denied six months earlier. Based on its review of\nthat previously rejected motion, the court issued a stay a\nfew days before respondent’s scheduled execution. Even\nassuming, as we did in Bell v. Thompson, 545 U. S. 794\n(2005), that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) admits of any exceptions, the\nNinth Circuit did not demonstrate that exceptional cir­\ncumstances justified withholding its mandate.

S. ___.\n   Respondent returned to the Ninth Circuit that day and\nfiled a motion requesting a stay of the mandate in light\nof a pending Ninth Circuit en banc case addressing the\ninteraction between Pinholster and Martinez.

But instead of\nissuing the mandate, the court decided sua sponte to con­\nstrue respondent’s motion “as a motion to reconsider our\nprior denial of his Motion to Vacate Judgment and Re­\nmand in light of Martinez,” which the court had denied on\nJuly 27, 2012.

We are un­\naware of any explanation for respondent’s delay in bringing his\nMartinez-based argument to the Ninth Circuit’s attention.\n4                     RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\na motion for stay of execution on February 26, 2013. The\nNinth Circuit panel granted the motion on March 1, 2013,\nwith Judge Graber again noting her dissent.\n   On March 4, 2013, Arizona filed a petition for rehearing\nand rehearing en banc with the Ninth Circuit. The court\ndenied the petition the same day, with eight judges dis­\nsenting in two separate opinions. 709 F. 3d 855 (2013).\n   On March 4, Arizona filed an application to vacate the\nstay of execution in this Court, along with a petition for\ncertiorari. This Court denied the application, with JUS-\nTICES SCALIA and ALITO noting that they would grant\nit. 568 U. S. ___ (2013). We now consider the petition.\n                             II\n   Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D) sets\nforth the default rule that “[t]he court of appeals must\nissue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme\nCourt order denying the petition for writ of certiorari\nis filed.” (Emphasis added.) The reason for this Rule is\nstraightforward: “[T]he stay of mandate is entered solely\nto allow this Court time to consider a petition for certio­\nrari.” Bell, 545 U. S., at 806. Hence, once this Court has\ndenied a petition, there is generally no need for further\naction from the lower courts. See ibid. (“[A] decision by\nthis Court denying discretionary review usually signals\nthe end of litigation”). In Bell, Tennessee argued that\nRule 41(d)(2)(D) “admits of no exceptions, so the mandate\nshould have issued on the date” the Court of Appeals\nreceived notice of the Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari.\nId., at 803. There was no need to resolve this issue in Bell\nbecause we concluded that the Sixth Circuit had abused\nits discretion even if Rule 41(d)(2)(D) authorized a stay of\nthe mandate after denial of certiorari. Id., at 803–804. As\nin Bell, we need not resolve this issue to determine that\nthe Ninth Circuit abused its discretion here.\n   Bell recognized that when state-court judgments are\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nreviewed in federal habeas proceedings, “finality and comity\nconcerns,” based in principles of federalism, demand\nthat federal courts “accord the appropriate level of respect\nto” state judgments by allowing them to be enforced\nwhen federal proceedings conclude. Id., at 812–813.\nAs we noted, States have an “ ‘ “interest in the finality of\nconvictions that have survived direct review within the\nstate court system.” ’ ” Id., at 813 (quoting Calderon v.\nThompson, 523 U. S. 538, 555 (1998), in turn quoting\nBrecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993)). Else­\nwhere, we explained that “ ‘the profound interests in\nrepose’ attaching to the mandate of a court of appeals”\ndictate that “the power [to withdraw the mandate] can be\nexercised only in extraordinary circumstances.” Calderon,\nsupra, at 550 (quoting 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.\nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3938, p. 712 (2d\ned. 1996)). Deviation from normal mandate procedures is\na power “of last resort, to be held in reserve against grave,\nunforeseen contingencies.” Calderon, supra, at 550. Even\nassuming a court of appeals has authority to do so, it\nabuses its discretion when it refuses to issue the mandate\nonce the Supreme Court has acted on the petition, unless\nextraordinary circumstances justify that action.\n   Applying this standard in Bell, we found no extraordi­\nnary circumstances that could constitute a miscarriage of\njustice. There, a capital defendant unsuccessfully alleged\nin state postconviction proceedings that his trial counsel\nhad been ineffective by failing to introduce sufficient\nmitigating evidence in the penalty phase of trial. 545\nU. S., at 797. On federal habeas review, he made the\nsame argument. Id., at 798. After the Sixth Circuit af­\nfirmed, the defendant filed a petition for rehearing that\n“placed substantial emphasis” on his argument that the\nSixth Circuit had overlooked new psychiatrist evidence.\nId., at 800. While the Sixth Circuit denied the petition, it\nstayed the issuance of its mandate while the defendant\n6                         RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nsought certiorari and, later, rehearing from the denial of\nthe writ. Ibid.\n   When this Court denied the petition for rehearing, the\nSixth Circuit did not issue its mandate. Instead, the Sixth\nCircuit waited five months (and until two days before the\nscheduled execution) to issue an amended opinion that va-\ncated the District Court’s denial of habeas and remanded\nfor an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective-assistance-\nof-counsel claim. Id., at 800–801. This Court reversed\nthat decision, holding that the Sixth Circuit had abused\nits discretion due to its delay in issuing the mandate\nwithout notifying the parties, its reliance on a previously\nrejected argument, and its disregard of comity and federal­\nism principles.\n   In this case, the Ninth Circuit similarly abused its\ndiscretion when it did not issue the mandate. As in Bell,\nthe Ninth Circuit here declined to issue the mandate\nbased on an argument it had considered and rejected\nmonths earlier. And, by the time of the Ninth Circuit’s\nFebruary 1, 2013, decision not to issue its mandate, it had\nbeen over 10 months since we decided Martinez and nearly\n7 months since respondent unsuccessfully asked the Ninth\nCircuit to reconsider its decision in light of Martinez.3\n   Further, there is no doubt that the arguments presented\nin the rejected July 10, 2012, motion were identical to\nthose accepted by the Ninth Circuit the following Febru­\nary. Respondent styled his July 10 motion a “Motion to\nVacate Judgment and Remand to the District Court for\nAdditional Proceedings in Light of Martinez v. Ryan.” No.\n07–99005 (CA9), Doc. 88, p. 1. As its title suggests, the\nonly claim presented in that motion was that respondent’s\n\n——————\n    3 Respondentdid not even present the motion that the Ninth Circuit\nultimately reinstated until more than 4 months after the Ninth Circuit\ndenied respondent’s request for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc\nand more than 3½ months after Martinez was decided.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)              7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\npostconviction counsel should have developed more evi­\ndence to support his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim. Here, as in Bell, respondent’s July 10 motion\n“pressed the same arguments that eventually were adopted\nby the Court of Appeals.” 545 U. S., at 806. These ar-\nguments were pressed so strongly in the July 10 motion\nthat “[i]t is difficult to see how . . . counsel could have been\nclearer.” Id., at 808. The Ninth Circuit had a full “oppor­\ntunity to consider these arguments” but declined to do so,\nid., at 806, which “support[s] our determination that the\ndecision to withhold the mandate was in error.” Id., at\n806–807. We presume that the Ninth Circuit carefully\nconsiders each motion a capital defendant presents on\nhabeas review. See id., at 808 (rejecting the notion that\n“judges cannot be relied upon to read past the first page of\na petition for rehearing”). As a result, there is no indica­\ntion that there were any extraordinary circumstances here\nthat called for the court to revisit an argument sua sponte\nthat it already explicitly rejected.\n   Finally, this case presents an additional issue not pre­\nsent in Bell. In refusing to issue the mandate, the Ninth\nCircuit panel relied heavily upon Beardslee v. Brown, 393\nF. 3d 899, 901 (CA9 2004) (per curiam), Beardslee, which\nprecedes our Bell decision by more than six months, as­\nserts the Ninth Circuit’s inherent authority to withhold a\nmandate. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A–3 to A–4, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">791610</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1. But Beardslee was based on the Sixth Cir­\ncuit’s decision in Bell, which we reversed. See Beardslee,\nsupra, at 901 (citing Thompson v. Bell, 373 F. 3d 688, 691–\n692 (2004)). That opinion, thus, provides no support for\nthe Ninth Circuit’s decision.\n   In light of the foregoing, we hold that the Ninth Circuit\nabused its discretion when it neglected to issue its man­\ndate. The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\nNinth Circuit’s judgment is reversed, the stay of execution\n8                     RYAN v.

In Bell, Tennessee argued that\nRule 41(d)(2)(D) “admits of no exceptions, so the mandate\nshould have issued on the date” the Court of Appeals\nreceived notice of the Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari.\nId., at 803. There was no need to resolve this issue in Bell\nbecause we concluded that the Sixth Circuit had abused\nits discretion even if Rule 41(d)(2)(D) authorized a stay of\nthe mandate after denial of certiorari. Id., at 803–804. As\nin Bell, we need not resolve this issue to determine that\nthe Ninth Circuit abused its discretion here.\n   Bell recognized that when state-court judgments are\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nreviewed in federal habeas proceedings, “finality and comity\nconcerns,” based in principles of federalism, demand\nthat federal courts “accord the appropriate level of respect\nto” state judgments by allowing them to be enforced\nwhen federal proceedings conclude. Id., at 812–813.\nAs we noted, States have an “ ‘ “interest in the finality of\nconvictions that have survived direct review within the\nstate court system.” ’ ” Id., at 813 (quoting Calderon v.\nThompson, 523 U. S. 538, 555 (1998), in turn quoting\nBrecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993)). Else­\nwhere, we explained that “ ‘the profound interests in\nrepose’ attaching to the mandate of a court of appeals”\ndictate that “the power [to withdraw the mandate] can be\nexercised only in extraordinary circumstances.” Calderon,\nsupra, at 550 (quoting 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.\nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3938, p. 712 (2d\ned. 1996)). Deviation from normal mandate procedures is\na power “of last resort, to be held in reserve against grave,\nunforeseen contingencies.” Calderon, supra, at 550. Even\nassuming a court of appeals has authority to do so, it\nabuses its discretion when it refuses to issue the mandate\nonce the Supreme Court has acted on the petition, unless\nextraordinary circumstances justify that action.\n   Applying this standard in Bell, we found no extraordi­\nnary circumstances that could constitute a miscarriage of\njustice. There, a capital defendant unsuccessfully alleged\nin state postconviction proceedings that his trial counsel\nhad been ineffective by failing to introduce sufficient\nmitigating evidence in the penalty phase of trial. 545\nU. S., at 797. On federal habeas review, he made the\nsame argument. Id., at 798. After the Sixth Circuit af­\nfirmed, the defendant filed a petition for rehearing that\n“placed substantial emphasis” on his argument that the\nSixth Circuit had overlooked new psychiatrist evidence.\nId., at 800. While the Sixth Circuit denied the petition, it\nstayed the issuance of its mandate while the defendant\n6                         RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nsought certiorari and, later, rehearing from the denial of\nthe writ. Ibid.\n   When this Court denied the petition for rehearing, the\nSixth Circuit did not issue its mandate. Instead, the Sixth\nCircuit waited five months (and until two days before the\nscheduled execution) to issue an amended opinion that va-\ncated the District Court’s denial of habeas and remanded\nfor an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective-assistance-\nof-counsel claim. Id., at 800–801. This Court reversed\nthat decision, holding that the Sixth Circuit had abused\nits discretion due to its delay in issuing the mandate\nwithout notifying the parties, its reliance on a previously\nrejected argument, and its disregard of comity and federal­\nism principles.\n   In this case, the Ninth Circuit similarly abused its\ndiscretion when it did not issue the mandate. As in Bell,\nthe Ninth Circuit here declined to issue the mandate\nbased on an argument it had considered and rejected\nmonths earlier. And, by the time of the Ninth Circuit’s\nFebruary 1, 2013, decision not to issue its mandate, it had\nbeen over 10 months since we decided Martinez and nearly\n7 months since respondent unsuccessfully asked the Ninth\nCircuit to reconsider its decision in light of Martinez.3\n   Further, there is no doubt that the arguments presented\nin the rejected July 10, 2012, motion were identical to\nthose accepted by the Ninth Circuit the following Febru­\nary. Respondent styled his July 10 motion a “Motion to\nVacate Judgment and Remand to the District Court for\nAdditional Proceedings in Light of Martinez v. Ryan.” No.\n07–99005 (CA9), Doc. 88, p. 1. As its title suggests, the\nonly claim presented in that motion was that respondent’s\n\n——————\n    3 Respondentdid not even present the motion that the Ninth Circuit\nultimately reinstated until more than 4 months after the Ninth Circuit\ndenied respondent’s request for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc\nand more than 3½ months after Martinez was decided.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)              7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\npostconviction counsel should have developed more evi­\ndence to support his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim. Here, as in Bell, respondent’s July 10 motion\n“pressed the same arguments that eventually were adopted\nby the Court of Appeals.” 545 U. S., at 806. These ar-\nguments were pressed so strongly in the July 10 motion\nthat “[i]t is difficult to see how . . . counsel could have been\nclearer.” Id., at 808. The Ninth Circuit had a full “oppor­\ntunity to consider these arguments” but declined to do so,\nid., at 806, which “support[s] our determination that the\ndecision to withhold the mandate was in error.” Id., at\n806–807. We presume that the Ninth Circuit carefully\nconsiders each motion a capital defendant presents on\nhabeas review. See id., at 808 (rejecting the notion that\n“judges cannot be relied upon to read past the first page of\na petition for rehearing”). As a result, there is no indica­\ntion that there were any extraordinary circumstances here\nthat called for the court to revisit an argument sua sponte\nthat it already explicitly rejected.\n   Finally, this case presents an additional issue not pre­\nsent in Bell. In refusing to issue the mandate, the Ninth\nCircuit panel relied heavily upon Beardslee v. Brown, 393\nF. 3d 899, 901 (CA9 2004) (per curiam), Beardslee, which\nprecedes our Bell decision by more than six months, as­\nserts the Ninth Circuit’s inherent authority to withhold a\nmandate. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A–3 to A–4, 2013 WL\n791610, *1. But Beardslee was based on the Sixth Cir­\ncuit’s decision in Bell, which we reversed. See Beardslee,\nsupra, at 901 (citing Thompson v. Bell, 373 F. 3d 688, 691–\n692 (2004)). That opinion, thus, provides no support for\nthe Ninth Circuit’s decision.\n   In light of the foregoing, we hold that the Ninth Circuit\nabused its discretion when it neglected to issue its man­\ndate. The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\nNinth Circuit’s judgment is reversed, the stay of execution\n8                     RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nis vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to\nissue the mandate immediately and without any further\nproceedings.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/931123/", "sha1": "22a63d335298f1e175f9f39e9579e3bfcf0b019e", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2012-076", "time_retrieved": "2013-06-24T17:01:14.042922"}
