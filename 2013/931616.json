Argued April 16, 2013—Decided June 25, 2013\nThe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), which establishes feder-\n  al standards for state-court child custody proceedings involving Indi-\n  an children, was enacted to address “the consequences . . . of abusive\n  child welfare practices that [separated] Indian children from their\n  families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement, usual-\n  ly in non-Indian homes,” Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.\n  Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 32. As relevant here, the ICWA bars involun-\n  tary termination of a parent’s rights in the absence of a heightened\n  showing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to result from\n  the parent’s “continued custody” of the child, 25 U. S. C. §1912(f);\n  conditions involuntary termination of parental rights with respect to\n  an Indian child on a showing that remedial efforts have been made to\n  prevent the “breakup of the Indian family,” §1912(d); and provides\n  placement preferences for the adoption of Indian children to members\n  of the child’s extended family, other members of the Indian child’s\n  tribe, and other Indian families, §1915(a).\n     While Birth Mother was pregnant with Biological Father’s child,\n  their relationship ended and Biological Father (a member of the\n  Cherokee Nation) agreed to relinquish his parental rights. Birth\n  Mother put Baby Girl up for adoption through a private adoption\n  agency and selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in South\n  Carolina. For the duration of the pregnancy and the first four\n  months after Baby Girl’s birth, Biological Father provided no finan-\n  cial assistance to Birth Mother or Baby Girl. About four months after\n  Baby Girl’s birth, Adoptive Couple served Biological Father with no-\n  tice of the pending adoption. In the adoption proceedings, Biological\n  Father sought custody and stated that he did not consent to the adop-\n  tion. Following a trial, which took place when Baby Girl was two\n2                  ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    years old, the South Carolina Family Court denied Adoptive Couple’s\n    adoption petition and awarded custody to Biological Father. At the\n    age of 27 months, Baby Girl was handed over to Biological Father,\n    whom she had never met. The State Supreme Court affirmed, con-\n    cluding that the ICWA applied because the child custody proceeding\n    related to an Indian child; that Biological Father was a “parent” un-\n    der the ICWA; that §§1912(d) and (f) barred the termination of his\n    parental rights; and that had his rights been terminated, §1915(a)’s\n    adoption-placement preferences would have applied.\nHeld:\n    1. Assuming for the sake of argument that Biological Father is a\n “parent” under the ICWA, neither §1912(f) nor §1912(d) bars the\n termination of his parental rights. Pp. 6–14.\n       (a) Section 1912(f) conditions the involuntary termination of pa-\n rental rights on a heightened showing regarding the merits of the\n parent’s “continued custody of the child.” The adjective “continued”\n plainly refers to a pre-existing state under ordinary dictionary defini-\n tions. The phrase “continued custody” thus refers to custody that a\n parent already has (or at least had at some point in the past). As a\n result, §1912(f) does not apply where the Indian parent never had\n custody of the Indian child. This reading comports with the statutory\n text, which demonstrates that the ICWA was designed primarily to\n counteract the unwarranted removal of Indian children from Indian\n families. See §1901(4). But the ICWA’s primary goal is not implicat-\n ed when an Indian child’s adoption is voluntarily and lawfully initi-\n ated by a non-Indian parent with sole custodial rights. Nonbinding\n guidelines issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) demonstrate\n that the BIA envisioned that §1912(f)’s standard would apply only to\n termination of a custodial parent’s rights. Under this reading, Bio-\n logical Father should not have been able to invoke §1912(f) in this\n case because he had never had legal or physical custody of Baby Girl\n as of the time of the adoption proceedings. Pp. 7–11.\n       (b) Section §1912(d) conditions an involuntary termination of pa-\n rental rights with respect to an Indian child on a showing “that active\n efforts have been made to provide remedial services . . . designed to\n prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have\n proved unsuccessful.” Consistent with this text, §1912(d) applies on-\n ly when an Indian family’s “breakup” would be precipitated by termi-\n nating parental rights. The term “breakup” refers in this context to\n “[t]he discontinuance of a relationship,” American Heritage Diction-\n ary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or “an ending as an effective entity,” Webster’s\n Third New International Dictionary 273 (1961). But when an Indian\n parent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that child has\n never been in the Indian parent’s legal or physical custody, there is\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  no “relationship” to be “discontinu[ed]” and no “effective entity” to be\n  “end[ed]” by terminating the Indian parent’s rights. In such a situa-\n  tion, the “breakup of the Indian family” has long since occurred, and\n  §1912(d) is inapplicable. This interpretation is consistent with the\n  explicit congressional purpose of setting certain “standards for the\n  removal of Indian children from their families,” §1902, and with BIA\n  Guidelines. Section 1912(d)’s proximity to §§1912(e) and (f), which\n  both condition the outcome of proceedings on the merits of an Indian\n  child’s “continued custody” with his parent, strongly suggests that\n  the phrase “breakup of the Indian family” should be read in harmony\n  with the “continued custody” requirement. Pp. 11–14.\n     2. Section 1915(a)’s adoption-placement preferences are inapplica-\n  ble in cases where no alternative party has formally sought to adopt\n  the child. No party other than Adoptive Couple sought to adopt Baby\n  Girl in the Family Court or the South Carolina Supreme Court. Bio-\n  logical Father is not covered by §1915(a) because he did not seek to\n  adopt Baby Girl; instead, he argued that his parental rights should\n  not be terminated in the first place. And custody was never sought\n  by Baby Girl’s paternal grandparents, other members of the Chero-\n  kee Nation, or other Indian families. Pp. 14–16.\n398 S. C. 625, 731 S.

The\nprovisions of the federal statute at issue here do not de-\nmand this result.\n   Contrary to the State Supreme Court’s ruling, we hold\nthat 25 U. S. C. §1912(f )—which bars involuntary termi-\nnation of a parent’s rights in the absence of a heightened\nshowing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to\nresult from the parent’s “continued custody” of the child—\ndoes not apply when, as here, the relevant parent never\nhad custody of the child. We further hold that §1912(d)—\nwhich conditions involuntary termination of parental\n2                ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrights with respect to an Indian child on a showing that\nremedial efforts have been made to prevent the “breakup\nof the Indian family”—is inapplicable when, as here, the\nparent abandoned the Indian child before birth and never\nhad custody of the child. Finally, we clarify that §1915(a),\nwhich provides placement preferences for the adoption of\nIndian children, does not bar a non-Indian family like\nAdoptive Couple from adopting an Indian child when no\nother eligible candidates have sought to adopt the child.\nWe accordingly reverse the South Carolina Supreme Court’s\njudgment and remand for further proceedings.\n                             I\n   “The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), 92 Stat.\n3069, 25 U. S. C. §§1901–1963, was the product of rising\nconcern in the mid-1970’s over the consequences to In-\ndian children, Indian families, and Indian tribes of abusive\nchild welfare practices that resulted in the separation of\nlarge numbers of Indian children from their families and\ntribes through adoption or foster care placement, usually\nin non-Indian homes.” Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indi-\nans v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 32 (1989). Congress found\nthat “an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families\n[were being] broken up by the removal, often unwarranted,\nof their children from them by nontribal public and\nprivate agencies.” §1901(4). This “wholesale removal of\nIndian children from their homes” prompted Congress to\nenact the ICWA, which establishes federal standards that\ngovern state-court child custody proceedings involving\nIndian children. Id., at 32, 36 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also §1902 (declaring that the ICWA es-\ntablishes “minimum Federal standards for the removal of\nIndian children from their families”).1\n——————\n  1 It is undisputed that Baby Girl is an “Indian child” as defined by the\n\nICWA because she is an unmarried minor who “is eligible for member-\nship in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Three provisions of the ICWA are especially relevant to\nthis case. First, “[a]ny party seeking” an involuntary\ntermination of parental rights to an Indian child under\nstate law must demonstrate that “active efforts have\nbeen made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative\nprograms designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian\nfamily and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.”\n§1912(d). Second, a state court may not involuntarily\nterminate parental rights to an Indian child “in the ab-\nsence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a\nreasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert\nwitnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the\nparent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious\nemotional or physical damage to the child.” §1912(f ).\nThird, with respect to adoptive placements for an Indian\nchild under state law, “a preference shall be given, in the\nabsence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with\n(1) a member of the child’s extended family; (2) other\nmembers of the Indian child’s tribe; or (3) other Indian\nfamilies.” §1915(a).\n                            II\n  In this case, Birth Mother (who is predominantly His-\npanic) and Biological Father (who is a member of the\nCherokee Nation) became engaged in December 2008.\nOne month later, Birth Mother informed Biological Fa-\nther, who lived about four hours away, that she was preg-\nnant. After learning of the pregnancy, Biological Father\n\n—————— \n\nIndian tribe,” §1903(4)(b). See Brief for Respondent Birth Father 1, 51, \n\nn. 22; Brief for Respondent Cherokee Nation 1; Brief for Petitioners 44\n(“Baby Girl’s eligibility for membership in the Cherokee Nation de-\npends solely upon a lineal blood relationship with a tribal ancestor”).\nIt is also undisputed that the present case concerns a “child custody\nproceeding,” which the ICWA defines to include proceedings that\ninvolve “termination of parental rights” and “adoptive placement,”\n§1903(1).\n4             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nasked Birth Mother to move up the date of the wedding.\nHe also refused to provide any financial support until after\nthe two had married. The couple’s relationship deteriorated,\nand Birth Mother broke off the engagement in May 2009.\nIn June, Birth Mother sent Biological Father a text mes-\nsage asking if he would rather pay child support or re-\nlinquish his parental rights. Biological Father responded\nvia text message that he relinquished his rights.\n   Birth Mother then decided to put Baby Girl up for adop-\ntion. Because Birth Mother believed that Biological Fa-\nther had Cherokee Indian heritage, her attorney contacted\nthe Cherokee Nation to determine whether Biological\nFather was formally enrolled. The inquiry letter mis-\nspelled Biological Father’s first name and incorrectly\nstated his birthday, and the Cherokee Nation responded\nthat, based on the information provided, it could not verify\nBiological Father’s membership in the tribal records.\n   Working through a private adoption agency, Birth\nMother selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in\nSouth Carolina, to adopt Baby Girl. Adoptive Couple\nsupported Birth Mother both emotionally and financially\nthroughout her pregnancy. Adoptive Couple was present\nat Baby Girl’s birth in Oklahoma on September 15, 2009,\nand Adoptive Father even cut the umbilical cord. The\nnext morning, Birth Mother signed forms relinquishing\nher parental rights and consenting to the adoption. Adop-\ntive Couple initiated adoption proceedings in South Caro-\nlina a few days later, and returned there with Baby Girl.\nAfter returning to South Carolina, Adoptive Couple al-\nlowed Birth Mother to visit and communicate with Baby\nGirl.\n   It is undisputed that, for the duration of the pregnancy\nand the first four months after Baby Girl’s birth, Biologi-\ncal Father provided no financial assistance to Birth Mother\nor Baby Girl, even though he had the ability to do so. In-\ndeed, Biological Father “made no meaningful attempts\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nto assume his responsibility of parenthood” during this\nperiod. App. to Pet. for Cert. 122a (Sealed; internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   Approximately four months after Baby Girl’s birth,\nAdoptive Couple served Biological Father with notice of\nthe pending adoption. (This was the first notification\nthat they had provided to Biological Father regarding\nthe adoption proceeding.) Biological Father signed papers\nstating that he accepted service and that he was “not\ncontesting the adoption.” App. 37. But Biological Father\nlater testified that, at the time he signed the papers, he\nthought that he was relinquishing his rights to Birth\nMother, not to Adoptive Couple.\n   Biological Father contacted a lawyer the day after sign-\ning the papers, and subsequently requested a stay of the\nadoption proceedings.2 In the adoption proceedings, Bio-\nlogical Father sought custody and stated that he did not\nconsent to Baby Girl’s adoption. Moreover, Biological\nFather took a paternity test, which verified that he was\nBaby Girl’s biological father.\n   A trial took place in the South Carolina Family Court in\nSeptember 2011, by which time Baby Girl was two years\nold. 398 S. C. 625, 634–635, 731 S. E. 2d 550, 555–556\n(2012). The Family Court concluded that Adoptive Couple\nhad not carried the heightened burden under §1912(f ) of\nproving that Baby Girl would suffer serious emotional or\nphysical damage if Biological Father had custody. See id.,\nat 648–651, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562–564. The Family Court\ntherefore denied Adoptive Couple’s petition for adoption\nand awarded custody to Biological Father. Id., at 629,\n636, 731 S. E. 2d, at 552, 556. On December 31, 2011, at\n\n——————\n  2 Around  the same time, the Cherokee Nation identified Biological\nFather as a registered member and concluded that Baby Girl was an\n“Indian child” as defined in the ICWA. The Cherokee Nation inter-\nvened in the litigation approximately three months later.\n6               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe age of 27 months, Baby Girl was handed over to Bio-\nlogical Father, whom she had never met.3\n   The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the Family\nCourt’s denial of the adoption and the award of custody to\nBiological Father. Id., at 629, 731 S. E. 2d, at 552. The\nState Supreme Court first determined that the ICWA\napplied because the case involved a child custody proceed-\ning relating to an Indian child. Id., at 637, 643, n. 18, 731\nS. E. 2d, at 556, 560, n. 18. It also concluded that Biologi-\ncal Father fell within the ICWA’s definition of a “ ‘parent.’ ”\nId., at 644, 731 S. E. 2d, at 560. The court then held that\ntwo separate provisions of the ICWA barred the termina-\ntion of Biological Father’s parental rights. First, the court\nheld that Adoptive Couple had not shown that “active\nefforts ha[d] been made to provide remedial services and\nrehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup\nof the Indian family.” §1912(d); see also id., at 647–648,\n731 S. E. 2d, at 562. Second, the court concluded that\nAdoptive Couple had not shown that Biological Father’s\n“custody of Baby Girl would result in serious emotional or\nphysical harm to her beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at\n648–649, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562–563 (citing §1912(f )). Finally,\nthe court stated that, even if it had decided to terminate\nBiological Father’s parental rights, §1915(a)’s adoption-\nplacement preferences would have applied. Id., at 655–657,\n731 S. E. 2d, at 566–567. We granted certiorari. 568 U. S.\n___ (2013).\n                          III\n It is undisputed that, had Baby Girl not been 3/256\nCherokee, Biological Father would have had no right to\n——————\n  3 According to the guardian ad litem, Biological Father allowed Baby\n\nGirl to speak with Adoptive Couple by telephone the following day, but\nthen cut off all communication between them. Moreover, according to\nBirth Mother, Biological Father has made no attempt to contact her\nsince the time he took custody of Baby Girl.\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nobject to her adoption under South Carolina law. See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 49; 398 S. C., at 644, n. 19, 731 S. E. 2d, at\n560, n. 19 (“Under state law, [Biological] Father’s con-\nsent to the adoption would not have been required”). The\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court held, however, that Biolog-\nical Father is a “parent” under the ICWA and that two\nstatutory provisions—namely, §1912(f ) and §1912(d)—bar\nthe termination of his parental rights. In this Court,\nAdoptive Couple contends that Biological Father is not a\n“parent” and that §1912(f ) and §1912(d) are inapplicable.\nWe need not—and therefore do not—decide whether Bio-\nlogical Father is a “parent.” See §1903(9) (defining “par-\nent”).4 Rather, assuming for the sake of argument that he\nis a “parent,” we hold that neither §1912(f ) nor §1912(d)\nbars the termination of his parental rights.\n                              A\n   Section 1912(f ) addresses the involuntary termination\nof parental rights with respect to an Indian child. Specifi-\ncally, §1912(f ) provides that “[n]o termination of parental\nrights may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of\na determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasona-\nble doubt, . . . that the continued custody of the child by\nthe parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious\nemotional or physical damage to the child.” (Emphasis\nadded.) The South Carolina Supreme Court held that\nAdoptive Couple failed to satisfy §1912(f ) because they did\nnot make a heightened showing that Biological Father’s\n“prospective legal and physical custody” would likely result\nin serious damage to the child. 398 S. C., at 651, 731 S. E.\n2d, at 564 (emphasis added). That holding was error.\n——————\n   4 If Biological Father is not a “parent” under the ICWA, then §1912(f )\n\nand §1912(d)—which relate to proceedings involving possible termina-\ntion of “parental” rights—are inapplicable. Because we conclude that\nthese provisions are inapplicable for other reasons, however, we need\nnot decide whether Biological Father is a “parent.”\n8                ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Section 1912(f ) conditions the involuntary termination\nof parental rights on a showing regarding the merits of\n“continued custody of the child by the parent.” (Emphasis\nadded.) The adjective “continued” plainly refers to a pre-\nexisting state. As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR concedes, post, at\n11 (dissenting opinion) (hereinafter the dissent), “contin-\nued” means “[c]arried on or kept up without cessation”\nor “[e]xtended in space without interruption or breach of\nconne[ct]ion.” Compact Edition of the Oxford English\nDictionary 909 (1981 reprint of 1971 ed.) (Compact OED);\nsee also American Heritage Dictionary 288 (1981) (defin-\ning “continue” in the following manner: “1. To go on with\na particular action or in a particular condition; persist. . . .\n3. To remain in the same state, capacity, or place”); Web-\nster’s Third New International Dictionary 493 (1961)\n(Webster’s) (defining “continued” as “stretching out in time\nor space esp. without interruption”); Aguilar v. FDIC, 63\nF. 3d 1059, 1062 (CA11 1995) (per curiam) (suggesting\nthat the phrase “continue an action” means “go on with . . .\nan action” that is “preexisting”). The term “continued”\nalso can mean “resumed after interruption.” Webster’s\n493; see American Heritage Dictionary 288. The phrase\n“continued custody” therefore refers to custody that a\nparent already has (or at least had at some point in the\npast). As a result, §1912(f ) does not apply in cases where\nthe Indian parent never had custody of the Indian child.5\n  Biological Father’s contrary reading of §1912(f ) is non-\nsensical. Pointing to the provision’s requirement that\n——————\n    5 With\n         a torrent of words, the dissent attempts to obscure the fact\nthat its interpretation simply cannot be squared with the statutory\ntext. A biological father’s “continued custody” of a child cannot be\nassessed if the father never had custody at all, and the use of a differ-\nent phrase—“termination of parental rights”—cannot change that. In\naddition, the dissent’s reliance on subsection headings, post, at 9,\noverlooks the fact that those headings were not actually enacted by\nCongress.

See Brief for\nRespondent Birth Father 39. But it would be absurd to\nthink that Congress enacted a provision that permits\ntermination of a custodial parent’s rights, while simulta-\nneously prohibiting termination of a noncustodial parent’s\nrights. If the statute draws any distinction between\ncustodial and noncustodial parents, that distinction\nsurely does not provide greater protection for noncustodial\nparents.6\n   Our reading of §1912(f ) comports with the statutory text\ndemonstrating that the primary mischief the ICWA was\ndesigned to counteract was the unwarranted removal of\nIndian children from Indian families due to the cultural\ninsensitivity and biases of social workers and state courts.\nThe statutory text expressly highlights the primary prob-\nlem that the statute was intended to solve: “an alarmingly\nhigh percentage of Indian families [were being] broken up\nby the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from\nthem by nontribal public and private agencies.” §1901(4)\n(emphasis added); see also §1902 (explaining that the\nICWA establishes “minimum Federal standards for the\nremoval of Indian children from their families” (emphasis\nadded)); Holyfield, 490 U.

No. 95–1386,\np. 8 (1978) (explaining that, as relevant here, “[t]he pur-\npose of [the ICWA] is to protect the best interests of Indian\nchildren and to promote the stability and security of Indian\ntribes and families by establishing minimum Federal\nstandards for the removal of Indian children from their\nfamilies and the placement of such children in foster or\nadoptive homes” (emphasis added)); id., at 9 (decrying the\n“wholesale separation of Indian children” from their Indian\nfamilies); id., at 22 (discussing “the removal” of Indian\nchildren from their parents pursuant to §§1912(e) and (f )).\nIn sum, when, as here, the adoption of an Indian child is\nvoluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent\nwith sole custodial rights, the ICWA’s primary goal of\npreventing the unwarranted removal of Indian children\nand the dissolution of Indian families is not implicated.\n   The dissent fails to dispute that nonbinding guidelines\nissued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) shortly after\nthe ICWA’s enactment demonstrate that the BIA envi-\nsioned that §1912(f )’s standard would apply only to termi-\nnation of a custodial parent’s rights. Specifically, the BIA\nstated that, under §1912(f ), “[a] child may not be removed\nsimply because there is someone else willing to raise the\nchild who is likely to do a better job”; instead, “[i]t must\nbe shown that . . . it is dangerous for the child to remain\nwith his or her present custodians.” Guidelines for State\nCourts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 44 Fed.

As an initial\nmatter, it is undisputed that Biological Father never had\nphysical custody of Baby Girl. And as a matter of both\nSouth Carolina and Oklahoma law, Biological Father\nnever had legal custody either. See S. C. Code Ann. §63–\n17–20(B) (2010) (“Unless the court orders otherwise, the\ncustody of an illegitimate child is solely in the natural\nmother unless the mother has relinquished her rights to\nthe child”); Okla.

See post, at 17–18, and n. 12 (emphasis\nadded). This is entirely beside the point, because we merely conclude\nthat, based on the statute’s text and structure, Congress did not extend\nthe heightened protections of §1912(d) and §1912(f ) to all biological\nfathers. The fact that state laws may provide certain protections to\nbiological fathers who have abandoned their children and who have\nnever had custody of their children in no way undermines our analysis\nof these two federal statutory provisions.\n12            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfamily and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.”\n(Emphasis added.) The South Carolina Supreme Court\nfound that Biological Father’s parental rights could not\nbe terminated because Adoptive Couple had not demon-\nstrated that Biological Father had been provided remedial\nservices in accordance with §1912(d). 398 S. C., at 647–\n648, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562. We disagree.\n   Consistent with the statutory text, we hold that\n§1912(d) applies only in cases where an Indian family’s\n“breakup” would be precipitated by the termination of the\nparent’s rights. The term “breakup” refers in this context\nto “[t]he discontinuance of a relationship,” American Her-\nitage Dictionary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or “an ending as an\neffective entity,” Webster’s 273 (defining “breakup” as “a\ndisruption or dissolution into component parts: an ending\nas an effective entity”). See also Compact OED 1076\n(defining “break-up” as, inter alia, a “disruption, separa-\ntion into parts, disintegration”). But when an Indian\nparent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that\nchild has never been in the Indian parent’s legal or\nphysical custody, there is no “relationship” that would be\n“discontinu[ed]”—and no “effective entity” that would\nbe “end[ed]”—by the termination of the Indian par-\nent’s rights. In such a situation, the “breakup of the\nIndian family” has long since occurred, and §1912(d) is\ninapplicable.\n   Our interpretation of §1912(d) is, like our interpretation\nof §1912(f ), consistent with the explicit congressional\npurpose of providing certain “standards for the removal of\nIndian children from their families.” §1902 (emphasis\nadded); see also, e.g., §1901(4); Holyfield, 490 U. S., at 32–\n34. In addition, the BIA’s Guidelines confirm that reme-\ndial services under §1912(d) are intended “to alleviate the\nneed to remove the Indian child from his or her parents or\nIndian custodians,” not to facilitate a transfer of the child\nto an Indian parent. See 44 Fed. Reg., at 67592 (emphasis\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

That these three provisions appear adjacent to\neach other strongly suggests that the phrase “breakup of\nthe Indian family” should be read in harmony with the\n“continued custody” requirement. See United Sav. Assn.\nof Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484\nU. S. 365, 371 (1988) (explaining that statutory construc-\ntion “is a holistic endeavor” and that “[a] provision that\nmay seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the\nremainder of the statutory scheme”). None of these three\nprovisions creates parental rights for unwed fathers where\nno such rights would otherwise exist. Instead, Indian\nparents who are already part of an “Indian family” are\nprovided with access to “remedial services and rehabilita-\ntive programs” under §1912(d) so that their “custody”\nmight be “continued” in a way that avoids foster-care\nplacement under §1912(e) or termination of parental\nrights under §1912(f ). In other words, the provision of\n“remedial services and rehabilitative programs” under\n§1912(d) supports the “continued custody” that is protected\nby §1912(e) and §1912(f ).8\n——————\n  8 The dissent claims that our reasoning “necessarily extends to all\n\nIndian parents who have never had custody of their children,” even if\nthose parents have visitation rights. Post, at 2–3, 13–14. As an initial\nmatter, the dissent’s concern about the effect of our decision on individ-\nuals with visitation rights will be implicated, at most, in a relatively\nsmall class of cases. For example, our interpretation of §1912(d) would\nimplicate the dissent’s concern only in the case of a parent who aban-\ndoned his or her child prior to birth and never had physical or legal\ncustody, but did have some sort of visitation rights. Moreover, in cases\nwhere this concern is implicated, such parents might receive “compara-\nble” protections under state law. See post, at 15. And in any event, it is\nthe dissent’s interpretation that would have far-reaching consequences:\n14               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Section 1912(d) is a sensible requirement when applied\nto state social workers who might otherwise be too quick\nto remove Indian children from their Indian families. It\nwould, however, be unusual to apply §1912(d) in the con-\ntext of an Indian parent who abandoned a child prior to\nbirth and who never had custody of the child. The decision\nbelow illustrates this point. The South Carolina Supreme\nCourt held that §1912(d) mandated measures such as\n“attempting to stimulate [Biological] Father’s desire to be\na parent.” 398 S. C., at 647, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562. But if\nprospective adoptive parents were required to engage in\nthe bizarre undertaking of “stimulat[ing]” a biological\nfather’s “desire to be a parent,” it would surely dissuade\nsome of them from seeking to adopt Indian children.9 And\nthis would, in turn, unnecessarily place vulnerable Indian\nchildren at a unique disadvantage in finding a permanent\nand loving home, even in cases where neither an Indian\nparent nor the relevant tribe objects to the adoption.10\n   In sum, the South Carolina Supreme Court erred in\nfinding that §1912(d) barred termination of Biological\nFather’s parental rights.\n                             IV\n     In the decision below, the South Carolina Supreme\n\n——————\nUnder the dissent’s reading, any biological parent—even a sperm\ndonor—would enjoy the heightened protections of §1912(d) and\n§1912(f ), even if he abandoned the mother and the child immediately\nafter conception.

C., at 655–657, 731 S. E. 2d, at 566–567. In so\ndoing, however, the court failed to recognize a critical lim-\nitation on the scope of §1915(a).\n   Section 1915(a) provides that “[i]n any adoptive place-\nment of an Indian child under State law, a preference\nshall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary,\nto a placement with (1) a member of the child’s extended\nfamily; (2) other members of the Indian child’s tribe; or\n(3) other Indian families.” Contrary to the South Carolina\nSupreme Court’s suggestion, §1915(a)’s preferences are\ninapplicable in cases where no alternative party has for-\nmally sought to adopt the child. This is because there\nsimply is no “preference” to apply if no alternative party\nthat is eligible to be preferred under §1915(a) has come\nforward.\n   In this case, Adoptive Couple was the only party that\nsought to adopt Baby Girl in the Family Court or the\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court. See Brief for Petitioners\n19, 55; Brief for Respondent Birth Father 48; Reply Brief\nfor Petitioners 13. Biological Father is not covered by\n§1915(a) because he did not seek to adopt Baby Girl; in-\nstead, he argued that his parental rights should not be\nterminated in the first place.11 Moreover, Baby Girl’s\n——————\n  11 Section 1915(c) also provides that, in the case of an adoptive place-\nment under §1915(a), “if the Indian child’s tribe shall establish a\ndifferent order of preference by resolution, the agency or court effecting\nthe placement shall follow such order so long as the placement is the\nleast restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child,\nas provided in [§1915(b)].” Although we need not decide the issue\nhere, it may be the case that an Indian child’s tribe could alter §1915’s\npreferences in a way that includes a biological father whose rights were\nterminated, but who has now reformed. See §1915(c). If a tribe were to\ntake such an approach, however, the court would still have the power to\ndetermine whether “good cause” exists to disregard the tribe’s order of\n16               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Nor did other members of the\nCherokee Nation or “other Indian families” seek to adopt\nBaby Girl, even though the Cherokee Nation had notice\nof—and intervened in—the adoption proceedings.

As the State Supreme Court read\n§§1912(d) and (f ), a biological Indian father could abandon\nhis child in utero and refuse any support for the birth\nmother—perhaps contributing to the mother’s decision to\nput the child up for adoption—and then could play his\nICWA trump card at the eleventh hour to override the\nmother’s decision and the child’s best interests. If this\nwere possible, many prospective adoptive parents would\nsurely pause before adopting any child who might possibly\nqualify as an Indian under the ICWA.

However, this testi-\nmony was only a general statement regarding the Cherokee Nation’s\npractices; it did not demonstrate that a specific Indian family was\nwilling to adopt Baby Girl, let alone that such a family formally sought\nsuch adoption in the South Carolina courts.

Each party in this case has put forward a plausible\ninterpretation of the relevant sections of the Indian Child\nWelfare Act (ICWA). However, the interpretations offered\nby respondent Birth Father and the United States raise\nsignificant constitutional problems as applied to this\ncase. Because the Court’s decision avoids those problems,\nI concur in its interpretation.\n                              I\n  This case arises out of a contested state-court adoption\nproceeding. Adoption proceedings are adjudicated in state\nfamily courts across the country every day, and “domestic\nrelations” is “an area that has long been regarded as a\nvirtually exclusive province of the States.” Sosna v. Iowa,\n419 U. S. 393, 404 (1975). Indeed, “[t]he whole subject of\nthe domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and\nchild, belongs to the laws of the States and not to the laws\nof the United States.” In re Burrus, 136 U. S. 586, 593–\n594 (1890). Nevertheless, when Adoptive Couple filed a\npetition in South Carolina Family Court to finalize their\nadoption of Baby Girl, Birth Father, who had relinquished\n2             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nhis parental rights via a text message to Birth Mother,\nclaimed a federal right under the ICWA to block the adop-\ntion and to obtain custody.\n   The ICWA establishes “federal standards that govern\nstate-court child custody proceedings involving Indian\nchildren.” Ante, at 2. The ICWA defines “Indian child” as\n“any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is\neither (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible\nfor membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological\nchild of a member of an Indian tribe.” 25 U. S. C. §1903(4).\nAs relevant, the ICWA defines “child custody proceeding,”\n§1903(1), to include “adoptive placement,” which means\n“the permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption,\nincluding any action resulting in a final decree of adop-\ntion,” §1903(1)(iv), and “termination of parental rights,”\nwhich means “any action resulting in the termination of\nthe parent-child relationship,” §1903(1)(ii).\n   The ICWA restricts a state court’s ability to terminate\nthe parental rights of an Indian parent in two relevant\nways. Section 1912(f) prohibits a state court from involun-\ntarily terminating parental rights “in the absence of a\ndetermination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses,\nthat the continued custody of the child by the parent or\nIndian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or\nphysical damage to the child.” Section 1912(d) prohibits a\nstate court from terminating parental rights until the\ncourt is satisfied “that active efforts have been made to\nprovide remedial services and rehabilitative programs\ndesigned to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and\nthat these efforts have proved unsuccessful.” A third\nprovision creates specific placement preferences for the\nadoption of Indian children, which favor placement with\nIndians over other adoptive families. §1915(a). Operating\ntogether, these requirements often lead to different out-\ncomes than would result under state law. That is precisely\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

See ante, at 6 (“It is undisputed\nthat, had Baby Girl not been 3/256 Cherokee, Biological\nFather would have had no right to object to her adoption\nunder South Carolina law”).\n   The ICWA recognizes States’ inherent “jurisdiction over\nIndian child custody proceedings,” §1901(5), but asserts\nthat federal regulation is necessary because States “have\noften failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of\nIndian people and the cultural and social standards pre-\nailing in Indian communities and families,” ibid. However,\nCongress may regulate areas of traditional state concern\nonly if the Constitution grants it such power. Admt. 10\n(“The powers not delegated to the United States by the\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are re-\nserved to the States respectively, or to the people”). The\nthreshold question, then, is whether the Constitution\ngrants Congress power to override state custody law\nwhenever an Indian is involved.\n                              II\n   The ICWA asserts that the Indian Commerce Clause,\nArt. I, §8, cl. 3, and “other constitutional authority” pro-\nvides Congress with “plenary power over Indian affairs.”\n§1901(1). The reference to “other constitutional authority”\nis not illuminating, and I am aware of no other enumer-\nated power that could even arguably support Congress’\nintrusion into this area of traditional state authority.

Johnson, A\nDictionary of the English Language 361 (4th rev. ed. 1773)\n(reprint 1978) (defining commerce as “Intercourse; ex-\nchange of one thing for another; interchange of any thing;\ntrade; traffick”). “[W]hen Federalists and Anti-Federalists\ndiscussed the Commerce Clause during the ratification\nperiod, they often used trade (in its selling/bartering\nsense) and commerce interchangeably.” Lopez, supra, at\n586 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The term “commerce” did\nnot include economic activity such as “manufacturing and\nagriculture,” ibid., let alone noneconomic activity such as\nadoption of children.\n   Furthermore, the term “commerce with Indian tribes”\nwas invariably used during the time of the founding to\nmean “ ‘trade with Indians.’ ” See, e.g., Natelson, 215–216,\nand n. 97 (citing 18th-century sources); Report of Commit-\ntee on Indian Affairs (Feb 20, 1787), in 32 Journals of the\nContinental Congress 1774–1789, pp. 66, 68 (R. Hill ed.\n1936) (hereinafter J. Cont’l Cong.) (using the phrase\n“commerce with the Indians” to mean trade with the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nIndians). And regulation of Indian commerce generally\nreferred to legal structures governing “the conduct of\nthe merchants engaged in the Indian trade, the nature of the\ngoods they sold, the prices charged, and similar matters.”\nNatelson 216, and n. 99.\n  The Indian Commerce Clause contains an additional\ntextual limitation relevant to this case: Congress is given\nthe power to regulate Commerce “with the Indian tribes.”\nThe Clause does not give Congress the power to regulate\ncommerce with all Indian persons any more than the\nForeign Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to\nregulate commerce with all foreign nationals traveling\nwithin the United States. A straightforward reading of\nthe text, thus, confirms that Congress may only regulate\ncommercial interactions—“commerce”—taking place with\nestablished Indian communities—“tribes.” That power is\nfar from “plenary.”\n                              B\n   Congress’ assertion of “plenary power” over Indian\naffairs is also inconsistent with the history of the Indian\nCommerce Clause. At the time of the founding, the Clause\nwas understood to reserve to the States general police\npowers with respect to Indians who were citizens of the\nseveral States. The Clause instead conferred on Congress\nthe much narrower power to regulate trade with Indian\ntribes—that is, Indians who had not been incorporated\ninto the body-politic of any State.\n                             1\n  Before the Revolution, most Colonies adopted their own\nregulations governing Indian trade. See Natelson 219,\nand n. 121 (citing colonial laws). Such regulations were\nnecessary because colonial traders all too often abused\ntheir Indian trading partners, through fraud, exorbitant\nprices, extortion, and physical invasion of Indian territory,\n6                 ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

These abuses sometimes provoked violent Indian\nretaliation. See Prucha 20. To mitigate these conflicts,\nmost Colonies extensively regulated traders engaged in\ncommerce with Indian tribes. See e.g., Ordinance to Regu-\nlate Indian Affairs, Statutes of South Carolina (Aug. 31,\n1751), in 16 Early American Indian Documents: Treaties\nand Laws, 1607–1789, pp. 331–334 (A. Vaughan and\nD. Rosen eds. 1998).1 Over time, commercial regulation at\nthe colonial level proved largely ineffective, in part be-\ncause “[t]here was no uniformity among the colonies, no\ntwo sets of like regulations.” Prucha 21.\n   Recognizing the need for uniform regulation of trade\nwith the Indians, Benjamin Franklin proposed his own\n“articles of confederation” to the Continental Congress on\nJuly 21, 1775, which reflected his view that central control\nover Indian affairs should predominate over local control.\n2 J. Cont’l Cong. 195–199 (W. Ford ed. 1905). Franklin’s\nproposal was not enacted, but in November 1775, Con-\ngress empowered a committee to draft regulations for\nthe Indian trade. 3 id., at 364, 366. On July 12, 1776, the\ncommittee submitted a draft of the Articles of Confedera-\ntion to Congress, which incorporated many of Franklin’s\nproposals. 5 id., at 545, 546, n. 1. The draft prohibited\nStates from waging offensive war against the Indians\nwithout congressional authorization and granted Congress\n\n——————\n   1 South Carolina, for example, required traders to be licensed, to be of\n\ngood moral character, and to post a bond.

Some delegates feared\nthat the Articles gave Congress excessive power to in-\nterfere with States’ jurisdiction over affairs with Indians\nresiding within state boundaries. After further delibera-\ntion, the final result was a clause that included a broad\ngrant of congressional authority with two significant\nexceptions: “The United States in Congress assembled\nshall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of\n. . . regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the\nIndians, not members of any of the States, provided that\nthe legislative right of any State within its own limits be\nnot infringed or violated.” Articles of Confederation, Art.\nIX, cl. 4. As a result, Congress retained exclusive jurisdic-\ntion over Indian affairs outside the borders of the States;\nthe States retained exclusive jurisdiction over relations\nwith Member-Indians;2 and Congress and the States “ex-\nercise[d] concurrent jurisdiction over transactions with\ntribal Indians within state boundaries, but congressional\ndecisions would have to be in compliance with local law.”\nNatelson 230.

Rossiter ed. 1961) (J.\nMadison).\n8             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\ntion reveals the delegates’ concern with protecting the\npower of the States to regulate Indian persons who were\npolitically incorporated into the States. This concern\nfor state power reemerged during the drafting of the\nConstitution.\n                              2\n   The drafting history of the Constitutional Convention\nalso supports a limited construction of the Indian Com-\nmerce Clause. On July 24, 1787, the convention elected\na drafting committee—the Committee of Detail—and\ncharged it to “report a Constitution conformable to the Res-\nolutions passed by the Convention.” 2 Records of the\nFederal Convention of 1787, p.106 (M. Farrand rev. 1966)\n(J. Madison). During the Committee’s deliberations, John\nRutledge, the chairman, suggested incorporating an In-\ndian affairs power into the Constitution. Id., at 137, n. 6,\n143. The first draft reported back to the convention,\nhowever, provided Congress with authority “[t]o regulate\ncommerce with foreign nations, and among the several\nStates,” id., at 181 (Madison) (Aug. 6, 1787), but did not\ninclude any specific Indian affairs clause. On August 18,\nJames Madison proposed that the Federal Government be\ngranted several additional powers, including the power\n“[t]o regulate affairs with the Indians as well within as\nwithout the limits of the U. States.” Id., at 324 (J. Madi-\nson) (emphasis added). On August 22, Rutledge delivered\nthe Committee of Detail’s second report, which modified\nMadison’s proposed clause. The Committee proposed to\nadd to Congress’ power “[t]o regulate commerce with\nforeign nations, and among the several States” the words,\n“and with Indians, within the Limits of any State, not\nsubject to the laws thereof.” Id., at 366–367 (Journal).\nThe Committee’s version, which echoed the Articles of\nConfederation, was far narrower than Madison’s proposal.\nOn August 31, the revised draft was submitted to a Com-\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

That Committee recommended adding\nto the Commerce Clause the phrase, “and with the Indian\ntribes,” id., at 493, which the Convention ultimately\nadopted.\n   It is, thus, clear that the Framers of the Constitution\nwere alert to the difference between the power to regulate\ntrade with the Indians and the power to regulate all In-\ndian affairs. By limiting Congress’ power to the former, the\nFramers declined to grant Congress the same broad pow-\ners over Indian affairs conferred by the Articles of Confed-\neration. See Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89\nCornell L. Rev. 1069, 1090 (2004).\n   During the ratification debates, opposition to the Indian\nCommerce Clause was nearly nonexistent. See Natelson\n248 (noting that Robert Yates, a New York Anti-Federalist\nwas “almost the only writer who objected to any part [of ]\nof the Commerce Clause—a clear indication that its scope\nwas understood to be fairly narrow” (footnote omitted)).\nGiven the Anti-Federalists’ vehement opposition to the\nConstitution’s other grants of power to the Federal Gov-\nernment, this silence is revealing. The ratifiers almost\ncertainly understood the Clause to confer a relatively\nmodest power on Congress—namely, the power to regulate\ntrade with Indian tribes living beyond state borders. And\nthis feature of the Constitution was welcomed by Federal-\nists and Anti-Federalists alike due to the considerable\ninterest in expanding trade with such Indian tribes. See,\ne.g., The Federalist No. 42, at 265 (J. Madison) (praising\nthe Constitution for removing the obstacles that had\nexisted under the Articles of Confederation to federal\ncontrol over “trade with Indians” (emphasis added)); 3 J.\nElliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on\nthe Adoption of the Federal Constitution 580 (2d ed. 1863)\n(Adam Stephens, at the Virginia ratifying convention,\nJune 23, 1788, describing the Indian tribes residing near\n10            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Saladino eds.\n2012) (conceding that there must be a standing army for\nsome purposes, including “trade with Indians”). There is\nlittle evidence that the ratifiers of the Constitution under-\nstood the Indian Commerce Clause to confer anything\nresembling plenary power over Indian affairs. See Natel-\nson 247–250.\n                            III\n  In light of the original understanding of the Indian\nCommerce Clause, the constitutional problems that would\nbe created by application of the ICWA here are evident.\nFirst, the statute deals with “child custody proceedings,”\n§1903(1), not “commerce.” It was enacted in response to\nconcerns that “an alarmingly high percentage of Indian\nfamilies [were] broken up by the removal, often unwar-\nranted, of their children from them by nontribal public\nand private agencies.” §1901(4). The perceived problem\nwas that many Indian children were “placed in non-Indian\nfoster and adoptive homes and institutions.” Ibid. This\nproblem, however, had nothing to do with commerce.\n  Second, the portions of the ICWA at issue here do not\nregulate Indian tribes as tribes. Sections 1912(d) and (f ),\nand §1915(a) apply to all child custody proceedings involv-\ning an Indian child, regardless of whether an Indian tribe\nis involved. This case thus does not directly implicate\nCongress’ power to “legislate in respect to Indian tribes.”\nUnited States v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193, 200 (2004) (emphasis\nadded). Baby Girl was never domiciled on an Indian\nReservation, and the Cherokee Nation had no jurisdiction\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                  11\n\n                        THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nover her. Cf. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.\nHolyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 53–54 (1989) (holding that the\nIndian Tribe had exclusive jurisdiction over child custody\nproceedings, even though the children were born off the\nreservation, because the children were “domiciled” on the\nreservation for purposes of the ICWA). Although Birth\nFather is a registered member of The Cherokee Nation, he\ndid not live on a reservation either. He was, thus, subject\nto the laws of the State in which he resided (Oklahoma)\nand of the State where his daughter resided during the\ncustody proceedings (South Carolina). Nothing in the In-\ndian Commerce Clause permits Congress to enact spe-\ncial laws applicable to Birth Father merely because of his\nstatus as an Indian.3\n  Because adoption proceedings like this one involve\nneither “commerce” nor “Indian tribes,” there is simply no\nconstitutional basis for Congress’ assertion of authority\nover such proceedings. Also, the notion that Congress can\ndirect state courts to apply different rules of evidence and\nprocedure merely because a person of Indian descent is\ninvolved raises absurd possibilities. Such plenary power\nwould allow Congress to dictate specific rules of criminal\nprocedure for state-court prosecutions against Indian\ndefendants. Likewise, it would allow Congress to substi-\ntute federal law for state law when contract disputes\ninvolve Indians. But the Constitution does not grant\nCongress power to override state law whenever that law\n\n——————\n  3 Petitioners and the guardian ad litem contend that applying the\n\nICWA to child custody proceedings on the basis of race implicates equal\nprotection concerns. See Brief for Petitioners 45 (arguing that the\nstatute would be unconstitutional “if unwed fathers with no preexisting\nsubstantive parental rights receive a statutory preference based solely\non the Indian child’s race”); Brief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem\n48–49 (same). I need not address this argument because I am satisfied\nthat Congress lacks authority to regulate the child custody proceedings\nin this case.\n12            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

First,\nthe statute does not directly explain how to treat an ab-\nsentee Indian father who had next-to-no involvement with\nhis child in the first few months of her life. That category\nof fathers may include some who would prove highly un-\nsuitable parents, some who would be suitable, and a range\nof others in between. Most of those who fall within that\ncategory seem to fall outside the scope of the language of\n25 U. S. C. §§1912(d) and (f ). Thus, while I agree that the\nbetter reading of the statute is, as the majority concludes,\nto exclude most of those fathers, ante, at 8, 12, I also un-\nderstand the risk that, from a policy perspective, the\nCourt’s interpretation could prove to exclude too many.\nSee post, at 13, 22–23 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).\n   Second, we should decide here no more than is neces-\nsary. Thus, this case does not involve a father with visita-\ntion rights or a father who has paid “all of his child\nsupport obligations.” See post, at 13. Neither does it involve\nspecial circumstances such as a father who was deceived\nabout the existence of the child or a father who was pre-\nvented from supporting his child. See post, at 13 n. 8. The\nCourt need not, and in my view does not, now decide\nwhether or how §§1912(d) and (f ) apply where those cir-\n2              ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                      BREYER, J., concurring\n\ncumstances are present.\n  Third, other statutory provisions not now before us may\nnonetheless prove relevant in cases of this kind. Section\n1915(a) grants an adoptive “preference” to “(1) a member\nof the child’s extended family; (2) other members of the\nIndian child’s tribe; or (3) other Indian families . . . . in the\nabsence of good cause to the contrary.” Further, §1915(c)\nallows the “Indian child’s tribe” to “establish a different\norder of preference by resolution.” Could these provisions\nallow an absentee father to re-enter the special statutory\norder of preference with support from the tribe, and sub-\nject to a court’s consideration of “good cause?” I raise, but\ndo not here try to answer, the question.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

I reject the conclusion that the Court draws from\nthe words “continued custody” in 25 U. S. C §1912(f) not\nbecause “literalness may strangle meaning,” see post, at\n11, but because there is no reason that “continued” must\nrefer to custody in the past rather than custody in the\nfuture. I read the provision as requiring the court to\nsatisfy itself (beyond a reasonable doubt) not merely that\ninitial or temporary custody is not “likely to result in\nserious emotional or physical damage to the child,” but\nthat continued custody is not likely to do so. See Web-\nster’s New International Dictionary 577 (2d ed. 1950)\n(defining “continued” as “[p]rotracted in time or space, esp.\nwithout interruption; constant”). For the reasons set forth\nin JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s dissent, that connotation is much\nmore in accord with the rest of the statute.\n  While I am at it, I will add one thought. The Court’s\nopinion, it seems to me, needlessly demeans the rights of\nparenthood. It has been the constant practice of the com-\nmon law to respect the entitlement of those who bring a\nchild into the world to raise that child. We do not inquire\nwhether leaving a child with his parents is “in the best\ninterest of the child.” It sometimes is not; he would be\n2             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

This father wants to raise\nhis daughter, and the statute amply protects his right to\ndo so. There is no reason in law or policy to dilute that\nprotection.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

In truth, however, the path from the text of\nthe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) to the result the\nCourt reaches is anything but clear, and its result any­\nthing but right.\n   The reader’s first clue that the majority’s supposedly\nstraightforward reasoning is flawed is that not all Mem­\nbers who adopt its interpretation believe it is compelled by\nthe text of the statute, see ante, at 1 (THOMAS, J., concur­\nring); nor are they all willing to accept the consequences\nit will necessarily have beyond the specific factual sce-\nnario confronted here, see ante, at 1 (BREYER, J., concurring).\nThe second clue is that the majority begins its analysis by\nplucking out of context a single phrase from the last clause\nof the last subsection of the relevant provision, and then\nbuilds its entire argument upon it. That is not how we\nordinarily read statutes. The third clue is that the major-\nity openly professes its aversion to Congress’ explicitly\nstated purpose in enacting the statute. The majority ex-\n2             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npresses concern that reading the Act to mean what it\nsays will make it more difficult to place Indian children in\nadoptive homes, see ante, at 14, 16, but the Congress that\nenacted the statute announced its intent to stop “an\nalarmingly high percentage of Indian families [from being]\nbroken up” by, among other things, a trend of “plac[ing]\n[Indian children] in non-Indian . . . adoptive homes.” 25\nU. S. C. §1901(4). Policy disagreement with Congress’ judg-\nment is not a valid reason for this Court to distort the pro­\nvisions of the Act. Unlike the majority, I cannot adopt\na reading of ICWA that is contrary to both its text and its\nstated purpose. I respectfully dissent.\n                               I\n  Beginning its reading with the last clause of §1912(f ),\nthe majority concludes that a single phrase appearing\nthere—“continued custody”—means that the entirety of\nthe subsection is inapplicable to any parent, however\ncommitted, who has not previously had physical or legal\ncustody of his child. Working back to front, the majority\nthen concludes that §1912(d), tainted by its association\nwith §1912(f ), is also inapplicable; in the majority’s view,\na family bond that does not take custodial form is not a\nfamily bond worth preserving from “breakup.” Because\nthere are apparently no limits on the contaminating power\nof this single phrase, the majority does not stop there.\nUnder its reading, §1903(9), which makes biological fa­\nthers “parent[s]” under this federal statute (and where,\nagain, the phrase “continued custody” does not appear),\nhas substantive force only when a birth father has physi­\ncal or state-recognized legal custody of his daughter.\n  When it excludes noncustodial biological fathers from\nthe Act’s substantive protections, this textually backward\nreading misapprehends ICWA’s structure and scope.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the majority’s focus on the per-\nceived parental shortcomings of Birth Father, its rea­\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

The majority thereby trans­\nforms a statute that was intended to provide uniform\nfederal standards for child custody proceedings involving\nIndian children and their biological parents into an illogi­\ncal piecemeal scheme.\n                               A\n   Better to start at the beginning and consider the opera­\ntion of the statute as a whole. Cf. ante, at 13 (“[S]tatutory\nconstruction ‘is a holistic endeavor[,]’ and . . . ‘[a] provision\nthat may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by\nthe remainder of the statutory scheme’ ” (quoting United\nSav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates,\nLtd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988))).\n   ICWA commences with express findings. Congress rec­\nognized that “there is no resource that is more vital to\nthe continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than\ntheir children,” 25 U. S. C. §1901(3), and it found that this\nresource was threatened. State authorities insufficiently\nsensitive to “the essential tribal relations of Indian people\nand the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian\ncommunities and families” were breaking up Indian fami­\nlies and moving Indian children to non-Indian homes and\ninstitutions. See §§1901(4)–(5). As §1901(4) makes clear,\nand as this Court recognized in Mississippi Band of\nChoctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 33 (1989),\nadoptive placements of Indian children with non-Indian\nfamilies contributed significantly to the overall problem. See\n§1901(4) (finding that “an alarmingly high percentage of\n[Indian] children are placed in non-Indian . . . adoptive\nhomes”).\n   Consistent with these findings, Congress declared its\npurpose “to protect the best interests of Indian children\n4             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nand to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes\nand families by the establishment of minimum Federal\nstandards” applicable to child custody proceedings involv­\ning Indian children. §1902. Section 1903 then goes on to\nestablish the reach of these protections through its defi-\nnitional provisions. For present purposes, two of these\ndefinitions are crucial to understanding the statute’s full\nscope.\n   First, ICWA defines the term “parent” broadly to mean\n“any biological parent . . . of an Indian child or any In-\ndian person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child.”\n§1903(9). It is undisputed that Baby Girl is an “Indian\nchild” within the meaning of the statute, see §1903(4);\nante, at 2, n. 1, and Birth Father consequently qualifies\nas a “parent” under the Act. The statutory definition of\nparent “does not include the unwed father where paternity\nhas not been acknowledged or established,” §1903(9), but\nBirth Father’s biological paternity has never been ques­\ntioned by any party and was confirmed by a DNA test\nduring the state court proceedings, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n109a (Sealed).\n   Petitioners and Baby Girl’s guardian ad litem devote\nmany pages of briefing to arguing that the term “parent”\nshould be defined with reference to the law of the State in\nwhich an ICWA child custody proceeding takes place. See\nBrief for Petitioners 19–29; Brief for Respondent Guardian\nAd Litem 32–41. These arguments, however, are incon­\nsistent with our recognition in Holyfield that Congress\nintended the critical terms of the statute to have uniform\nfederal definitions. See 490 U. S., at 44–45. It is therefore\nunsurprising, although far from unimportant, that the\nmajority assumes for the purposes of its analysis that\nBirth Father is an ICWA “parent.” See ante, at 7.\n   Second, the Act’s comprehensive definition of “child\ncustody proceeding” includes not only “ ‘adoptive place­\nment[s],’ ” “ ‘preadoptive placement[s],’ ” and “ ‘foster care\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                  5\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nplacement[s],’ ” but also “ ‘termination of parental rights’ ”\nproceedings. §1903(1). This last category encompasses\n“any action resulting in the termination of the parent-\nchild relationship,” §1903(1)(ii) (emphasis added). So far,\nthen, it is clear that Birth Father has a federally recog­\nnized status as Baby Girl’s “parent” and that his “parent­\nchild relationship” with her is subject to the protections of\nthe Act.\n  These protections are numerous. Had Birth Father\npetitioned to remove this proceeding to tribal court, for\nexample, the state court would have been obligated to\ntransfer it absent an objection from Birth Mother or good\ncause to the contrary. See §1911(b). Any voluntary con­\nsent Birth Father gave to Baby Girl’s adoption would have\nbeen invalid unless written and executed before a judge\nand would have been revocable up to the time a final\ndecree of adoption was entered.1 See §§1913(a), (c). And\n§1912, the center of the dispute here, sets forth procedural\nand substantive standards applicable in “involuntary\nproceeding[s] in a State court,” including foster care\nplacements of Indian children and termination of paren­\ntal rights proceedings. §1912(a). I consider §1912’s provi­\nsions in order.\n  Section 1912(a) requires that any party seeking “termi­\nnation of parental rights t[o] an Indian child” provide\nnotice to both the child’s “parent or Indian custodian”\nand the child’s tribe “of the pending proceedings and of\ntheir right of intervention.” Section 1912(b) mandates\nthat counsel be provided for an indigent “parent or In-\ndian custodian” in any “termination proceeding.” Section\n——————\n  1 For this reason, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that Birth\n\nFather did not give valid consent to Baby Girl’s adoption when, four\nmonths after her birth, he signed papers stating that he accepted\nservice and was not contesting the adoption. See 398 S. C. 625, 645–\n646, 731 S. E. 2d 550, 561 (2012). See also ante, at 5. Petitioners do\nnot challenge this aspect of the South Carolina court’s holding.\n6                     ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                           SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n1912(c) also gives all “part[ies]” to a termination proceed­\ning—which, thanks to §§1912(a) and (b), will always in­\nclude a biological father if he desires to be present—the\nright to inspect all material “reports or other documents\nfiled with the court.” By providing notice, counsel, and\naccess to relevant documents, the statute ensures a biolog­\nical father’s meaningful participation in an adoption pro­\nceeding where the termination of his parental rights is at\nissue.\n   These protections are consonant with the principle,\nrecognized in our cases, that the biological bond between\nparent and child is meaningful. “[A] natural parent’s\ndesire for and right to the companionship, care, custody,\nand management of his or her children,” we have ex­\nplained, “is an interest far more precious than any prop-\nerty right.” Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 758–759\n(1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also infra,\nat 19-20. Although the Constitution does not compel the\nprotection of a biological father’s parent-child relationship\nuntil he has taken steps to cultivate it, this Court has\nnevertheless recognized that “the biological connection . . .\noffers the natural father an opportunity that no other\nmale possesses to develop a relationship with his off­\nspring.” Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248, 262 (1983).\nFederal recognition of a parent-child relationship between\na birth father and his child is consistent with ICWA’s\npurpose of providing greater protection for the familial\nbonds between Indian parents and their children than\nstate law may afford.\n   The majority does not and cannot reasonably dispute\nthat ICWA grants biological fathers, as “parent[s],” the\nright to be present at a termination of parental rights\nproceeding and to have their views and claims heard\nthere.2 But the majority gives with one hand and takes\n——————\n    2 Petitioners   concede that, assuming Birth Father is a “parent” under\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

Having assumed a uniform federal\ndefinition of “parent” that confers certain procedural\nrights, the majority then illogically concludes that ICWA’s\nsubstantive protections are available only to a subset of\n“parent[s]”: those who have previously had physical or\nstate-recognized legal custody of his or her child. The\nstatute does not support this departure.\n  Section 1912(d) provides that\n        “Any party seeking to effect a foster care placement\n     of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child\n     under State law shall satisfy the court that active\n     efforts have been made to provide remedial services\n     and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the\n     breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts\n     have proved unsuccessful.” (Emphasis added.)\nIn other words, subsection (d) requires that an attempt\nbe made to cure familial deficiencies before the drastic\nmeasures of foster care placement or termination of paren­\ntal rights can be taken.\n  The majority would hold that the use of the phrase\n“breakup of the Indian family” in this subsection means\nthat it does not apply where a birth father has not previ­\nously had custody of his child. Ante, at 12. But there is\nnothing about this capacious phrase that licenses such a\nnarrowing construction. As the majority notes, “breakup”\nmeans “ ‘[t]he discontinuance of a relationship.’ ” Ante, at\n12 (quoting American Heritage Dictionary 235 (3d ed.\n1992)). So far, all of §1912’s provisions expressly apply in\nactions aimed at terminating the “parent-child relation­\nship” that exists between a birth father and his child, and\nthey extend to it meaningful protections. As a logical\nmatter, that relationship is fully capable of being pre­\n\n—————— \n\nICWA, the notice and counsel provisions of 25 U. S. C. §§1912(a) and (b)\n\napply to him.

Nothing in the text of subsection (d)\nindicates that this blood relationship should be excluded\nfrom the category of familial “relationships” that the pro-\nvision aims to save from “discontinuance.”\n   The majority, reaching the contrary conclusion, asserts\nbaldly that “when an Indian parent abandons an Indian\nchild prior to birth and that child has never been in the\nIndian parent’s legal or physical custody, there is no ‘rela­\ntionship’ that would be ‘discontinu[ed]’ . . . by the termina­\ntion of the Indian parent’s rights.” Ante, at 12. Says who?\nCertainly not the statute. Section 1903 recognizes Birth\nFather as Baby Girl’s “parent,” and, in conjunction with\nICWA’s other provisions, it further establishes that their\n“parent-child relationship” is protected under federal law.\nIn the face of these broad definitions, the majority has no\nwarrant to substitute its own policy views for Congress’ by\nsaying that “no ‘relationship’ ” exists between Birth Father\nand Baby Girl simply because, based on the hotly con-\ntested facts of this case, it views their family bond as in-\nsufficiently substantial to deserve protection.3 Ibid.\n   The majority states that its “interpretation of §1912(d)\nis . . . confirmed by the provision’s placement next to\n——————\n  3 The majority’s discussion of §1912(d) repeatedly references Birth\n\nFather’s purported “abandon[ment]” of Baby Girl, ante, at 12, 13, n. 8,\n14, and it contends that its holding with regard to this provision is\nlimited to such circumstances, see ante, at 13, n. 8; see also ante, at 1\n(BREYER, J., concurring). While I would welcome any limitations on the\nmajority’s holding given that it is contrary to the language and purpose\nof the statute, the majority never explains either the textual basis or\nthe precise scope of its “abandon[ment]” limitation. I expect that the\nmajority’s inexact use of the term “abandon[ment]” will sow confusion,\nbecause it is a commonly used term of art in state family law that does\nnot have a uniform meaning from State to State. See generally 1 J.\nHollinger, Adoption Law and Practice §4.04[1][a][ii] (2012) (discussing\nvarious state-law standards for establishing parental abandonment of\na child).\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

This is the only aspect of\nthe majority’s argument regarding §1912(d) that is based\non ICWA’s actual text rather than layers of assertion su-\nperimposed on the text; but the conclusion the majority\ndraws from the juxtaposition of these provisions is exactly\nbackward.\n  Section 1912(f ) is paired with §1912(e), and as the ma­\njority notes, both come on the heels of the requirement of\nrehabilitative efforts just reviewed. The language of the\ntwo provisions is nearly identical; subsection (e) is headed\n“Foster care placement orders,” and subsection (f ), the\nrelevant provision here, is headed “Parental rights termi­\nnation orders.” Subsection (f ) reads in its entirety,\n       “No termination of parental rights may be ordered\n     in such proceeding in the absence of a determination,\n     supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, in­\n     cluding testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that\n     the continued custody of the child by the parent or In­\n     dian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional\n     or physical damage to the child.” §1912(f ).4\nThe immediate inference to be drawn from the statute’s\nstructure is that subsections (e) and (f ) work in tandem\nwith the rehabilitative efforts required by (d). Under\nsubsection (d), state authorities must attempt to provide\n“remedial services and rehabilitative programs” aimed at\navoiding foster care placement or termination of parental\nrights; (e) and (f ), in turn, bar state authorities from order­\n——————\n  4 The full text of subsection (e) is as follows:\n   “No foster care placement may be ordered in such proceeding in\nthe absence of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evi-\ndence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the\ncontinued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is\nlikely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.”\n§1912(e).\n10               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Nothing in\nsubsections (a) through (d) suggests a limitation on the\ntypes of parental relationships that are protected by any of\nthe provisions of §1912, and there is nothing in the struc­\nture of §1912 that would lead a reader to expect subsection\n(e) or (f ) to introduce any such qualification. Indeed, both\nsubsections, in their opening lines, refer back to the prior\nprovisions of §1912 with the phrase “in such proceeding.”\nThis language indicates, quite logically, that in actions\nwhere subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) apply, (e) and (f )\napply too.5\n   All this, and still the most telling textual evidence is yet\nto come: The text of the subsection begins by announcing,\n“[n]o termination of parental rights may be ordered” un­\nless the specified evidentiary showing is made. To repeat,\na “termination of parental rights” includes “any action\nresulting in the termination of the parent-child relation­\nship,” 25 U. S. C. §1903(1)(ii) (emphasis added), includ-\ning the relationship Birth Father, as an ICWA “parent,”\nhas with Baby Girl. The majority’s reading disregards\nthe Act’s sweeping definition of “termination of parental\nrights,” which is not limited to terminations of custodial\nrelationships.\n  The entire foundation of the majority’s argument that\n——————\n   5 For these reasons, I reject the argument advanced by the United\n\nStates that subsection (d) applies in the circumstances of this case but\nsubsection (f ) does not. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n24–26. The United States’ position is contrary to the interrelated\nnature of §§1912(d), (e), and (f ). Under the reading that the United\nStates proposes, in a case such as this one the curative provision would\nstand alone; ICWA would provide no evidentiary or substantive stand­\nards by which to measure whether foster care placement or termination\nof parental rights could be ordered in the event that rehabilitative\nefforts did not succeed. Such a scheme would be oddly incomplete.\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

Emphasizing\nthat Birth Father never had physical custody or, under\nstate law, legal custody of Baby Girl, the majority finds\nthe statute inapplicable here. Ante, at 10–11. But “liter­\nalness may strangle meaning.” Utah Junk Co. v. Porter,\n328 U. S. 39, 44 (1946). See also Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,\n519 U. S. 337, 341–345 (1997) (noting that a term that\nmay “[a]t first blush” seem unambiguous can prove other­\nwise when examined in the context of the statute as a\nwhole).6 In light of the structure of §1912, which indicates\nthat subsection (f ) is applicable to the same actions to\nwhich subsections (a) through (d) are applicable; the use of\nthe phrase “such proceeding[s]” at the start of subsection\n(f ) to reinforce this structural inference; and finally, the\nprovision’s explicit statement that it applies to “termina­\ntion of parental rights” proceedings, the necessary conclu­\nsion is that the word “custody” does not strictly denote a\nstate-recognized custodial relationship. If one refers back\nto the Act’s definitional section, this conclusion is not\nsurprising. Section 1903(1) includes “any action resulting\nin the termination of the parent-child relationship” within\nthe meaning of “child custody proceeding,” thereby belying\nany congressional intent to give the term “custody” a\nnarrow and exclusive definition throughout the statute.\n——————\n   6 The majority’s interpretation is unpersuasive even if one focuses\n\nexclusively on the phrase “continued custody” because, as JUSTICE\nSCALIA explains, ante, at 1 (dissenting opinion), nothing about the\nadjective “continued” mandates the retrospective, rather than prospec­\ntive, application of §1912(f )’s standard.\n12               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   In keeping with §1903(1) and the structure and lan­\nguage of §1912 overall, the phrase “continued custody” is\nmost sensibly read to refer generally to the continuation of\nthe parent-child relationship that an ICWA “parent” has\nwith his or her child. A court applying §1912(f ) where the\nparent does not have pre-existing custody should, as Birth\nFather argues, determine whether the party seeking ter­\nmination of parental rights has established that the con­\ntinuation of the parent-child relationship will result in\n“serious emotional or physical damage to the child.”7\n   The majority is willing to assume, for the sake of argu­\nment, that Birth Father is a “parent” within the meaning\nof ICWA. But the majority fails to account for all that\nfollows from that assumption. The majority repeatedly\npasses over the term “termination of parental rights” that,\nas defined by §1903, clearly encompasses an action aimed\nat severing Birth Father’s “parent-child relationship” with\nBaby Girl. The majority chooses instead to focus on\nphrases not statutorily defined that it then uses to exclude\nBirth Father from the benefits of his parental status.\nWhen one must disregard a statute’s use of terms that\nhave been explicitly defined by Congress, that should be a\nsignal that one is distorting, rather than faithfully read­\ning, the law in question.\n                              B\n     The majority also does not acknowledge the full impli­\n——————\n  7 The majority overlooks Birth Father’s principal arguments when it\n\ndismisses his reading of §1912(f ) as “nonsensical.” Ante, at 8.

Its logic would apply equally to noncustodial\nfathers who have actively participated in their child’s\nupbringing.\n  Consider an Indian father who, though he has never had\ncustody of his biological child, visits her and pays all of his\nchild support obligations.8 Suppose that, due to deficien­\n——————\n  8 The   majority attempts to minimize the consequences of its holding\nby asserting that the parent-child relationships of noncustodial fathers\nwith visitation rights will be at stake in an ICWA proceeding in only\n“a relatively small class of cases.” Ante, at 13, n. 8. But it offers no\nsupport for this assertion, beyond speculating that there will not be\nmany fathers affected by its interpretation of §1912(d) because it is\nqualified by an “abandon[ment]” limitation. Ibid. Tellingly, the major-\nity has nothing to say about §1912(f ), despite the fact that its interpre­\ntation of that provision is not limited in a similar way. In any event,\nthis example by no means exhausts the class of semiprotected ICWA\nparents that the majority’s opinion creates.

If\nthere are any examples of women who go to the trouble and expense of\nartificial insemination and then carry the child to term, only to put the\nchild up for adoption or be found so unfit as mothers that state authori­\nties attempt an involuntary adoptive placement—thereby necessitating\ntermination of the parental rights of the sperm donor father—the ma­\njority does not cite them. As between a possibly overinclusive in­\nterpretation of the statute that covers this unlikely class of cases, and\nthe majority’s underinclusive interpretation that has the very real\nconsequence of denying ICWA’s protections to all noncustodial biologi­\ncal fathers, it is surely the majority’s reading that is contrary to ICWA’s\ndesign.\n   9 With a few exceptions not relevant here, before a final decree of\n\nadoption may be entered, one of two things must happen: “the biological\nparents must either voluntarily relinquish their parental rights or have\ntheir rights involuntarily terminated.” 2A. Haralambie, Handling\nChild Custody, Abuse and Adoption Cases §14.1, pp.764–765 (3d ed.\n2009) (footnote omitted).\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

S. C.\n§1901(5). It provided a “minimum Federal standar[d],”\n§1902, for termination of parental rights that is more\ndemanding than the showing of unfitness under a high\n“clear and convincing evidence” standard that is the norm\nin the States, see 1 J. Hollinger, Adoption Law and Prac­\ntice §2.10 (2012); Santosky, 455 U. S., at 767–768.\n   While some States might provide protections compar-\nable to §1912(d)’s required remedial efforts and §1912(f )’s\nheightened standard for termination of parental rights,\nmany will provide less. There is no reason to believe\nCongress wished to leave protection of the parental rights\nof a subset of ICWA “parent[s]” dependent on the happen­\nstance of where a particular “child custody proceeding”\ntakes place. I would apply, as the statute construed in\nits totality commands, the standards Congress provided\nin §§1912(d) and (f ) to the termination of all ICWA\n“parent[s’]” parent-child relationships.\n                             II\n  The majority’s textually strained and illogical reading of\nthe statute might be explicable, if not justified, if there\nwere reason to believe that it avoided anomalous results\nor furthered a clear congressional policy. But neither of\nthese conditions is present here.\n                              A\n   With respect to §1912(d), the majority states that it\nwould be “unusual” to apply a rehabilitation requirement\nwhere a natural parent has never had custody of his child.\nAnte, at 14.

C., at\n647–648, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562, §1912(d) does not require\nthe prospective adoptive family to themselves undertake\nthe mandated rehabilitative efforts. Rather, it requires the\nparty seeking termination of parental rights to “satisfy\nthe court that active efforts have been made” to provide\nappropriate remedial services.\n  In other words, the prospective adoptive couple have to\nmake an evidentiary showing, not undertake person-to­\nperson remedial outreach. The services themselves might\nbe attempted by the Indian child’s Tribe, a state agency,\nor a private adoption agency. Such remedial efforts are\na familiar requirement of child welfare law, including fed-\neral child welfare policy. See 42 U. S.

S., at 766. In any event, the question is a nonissue\nin this case given the family court’s finding that Birth\nFather is “a fit and proper person to have custody of his\nchild” who “has demonstrated [his] ability to parent effec­\ntively” and who possesses “unwavering love for this child.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 128a (Sealed). Petitioners cannot\nshow that rehabilitative efforts have “proved unsuccess­\nful,” 25 U. S. C. §1912(d), because Birth Father is not in\nneed of rehabilitation.11\n                              B\n  On a more general level, the majority intimates that\nICWA grants Birth Father an undeserved windfall: in the\nmajority’s words, an “ICWA trump card” he can “play . . .\nat the eleventh hour to override the mother’s decision and\nthe child’s best interests.” Ante, at 16. The implicit argu­\nment is that Congress could not possibly have intended to\nrecognize a parent-child relationship between Birth Fa­\nther and Baby Girl that would have to be legally termi­\nnated (either by valid consent or involuntary termination) \n\nbefore the adoption could proceed. \n\n—————— \n\n   11 The majority’s concerns about what might happen if no state or\n\ntribal authority stepped in to provide remedial services are therefore\nirrelevant here. Ante, at 14, n. 9. But as a general matter, if a parent\nhas rights that are an obstacle to an adoption, the state- and federal­\nlaw safeguards of those rights must be honored, irrespective of pro­\nspective adoptive parents’ understandable and valid desire to see the\nadoption finalized. “We must remember that the purpose of an adop­\ntion is to provide a home for a child, not a child for a home.” In re\nPetition of Doe, 159 Ill. 2d, at 368, 638 N.

In fact, the law\nof at least 15 States did precisely that at the time ICWA\nwas passed.12 And the law of a number of States still does\nso.

On the other hand, these rules\nrecognize that biological fathers have a valid interest in a\nrelationship with their child. See supra, at 6.

This pref­\nerence is founded in the “presumption that fit parents act\nin the best interests of their children.” Troxel v. Granville,\n530 U.

(quoting Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 602 (1979)).\n   Balancing the legitimate interests of unwed biological\nfathers against the need for stability in a child’s family\nsituation is difficult, to be sure, and States have, over the\nyears, taken different approaches to the problem. Some\nStates, like South Carolina, have opted to hew to the con­\nstitutional baseline established by this Court’s prece-\ndents and do not require a biological father’s consent to\nadoption unless he has provided financial support during\npregnancy. See Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246, 254–\n256 (1978); Lehr, 463 U. S., at 261. Other States, how-\never, have decided to give the rights of biological fathers\nmore robust protection and to afford them consent rights\non the basis of their biological link to the child. At the\ntime that ICWA was passed, as noted, over one-fourth of\nStates did so. See supra, at 17–18.\n   ICWA, on a straightforward reading of the statute, is\nconsistent with the law of those States that protected, and\nprotect, birth fathers’ rights more vigorously. This read­\ning can hardly be said to generate an anomaly. ICWA, as\nall acknowledge, was “the product of rising concern . . .\n[about] abusive child welfare practices that resulted in the\nseparation of large numbers of Indian children from their\nfamilies.” Holyfield, 490 U.

Ante, at 14, 16. This claim is the most perplex­\ning of all. A central purpose of ICWA is to “promote the\nstability and security of Indian . . . families,” 25 U. S. C.\n§1902, in part by countering the trend of placing “an\nalarmingly high percentage of [Indian] children . . . in non-\nIndian foster and adoptive homes and institutions.”\n§1901(4). The Act accomplishes this goal by, first, protect­\ning the familial bonds of Indian parents and children, see\nsupra, at 4–12; and, second, establishing placement pref­\nerences should an adoption take place, see §1915(a).\nICWA does not interfere with the adoption of Indian chil­\ndren except to the extent that it attempts to avert the\nnecessity of adoptive placement and makes adoptions of\nIndian children by non-Indian families less likely.\n  The majority may consider this scheme unwise. But\nno principle of construction licenses a court to interpret a\nstatute with a view to averting the very consequences\nCongress expressly stated it was trying to bring about.\nInstead, it is the “ ‘judicial duty to give faithful meaning to\n——————\n   14 It bears emphasizing that the ICWA standard for termination of\n\nparental rights of which Birth Father claims the benefit is more protec­\ntive than, but not out of step with, the clear and convincing standard\ngenerally applied in state courts when termination of parental rights\nis sought. Birth Father does not claim that he is entitled to custody\nof Baby Girl unless petitioners can satisfy the demanding standard of\n§1912(f ). See Brief for Respondent Birth Father 40, n. 15. The ques­\ntion of custody would be analyzed independently, as it was by the South\nCarolina Supreme Court. Of course, it will often be the case that cus­\ntody is subsequently granted to a child’s fit parent, consistent with\nthe presumption that a natural parent will act in the best interests of\nhis child.

Ante, at 9–10. We may not, however, give\neffect only to congressional goals we designate “primary”\nwhile casting aside others classed as “secondary”; we must\napply the entire statute Congress has written. While there\nare indications that central among Congress’ concerns\nin enacting ICWA was the removal of Indian children\nfrom homes in which Indian parents or other guardians\nhad custody of them, see, e.g., §§1901(4), 1902, Con-\ngress also recognized that “there is no resource that is\nmore vital to the continued existence and integrity of\nIndian tribes than their children,” §1901(3). As we ob­\nserved in Holyfield, ICWA protects not only Indian par­\nents’ interests but also those of Indian tribes. See 490\nU. S., at 34, 52. A tribe’s interest in its next generation of\ncitizens is adversely affected by the placement of Indian\nchildren in homes with no connection to the tribe, whether\nor not those children were initially in the custody of an\nIndian parent.15\n   Moreover, the majority’s focus on “intact” families, ante,\nat 10, begs the question of what Congress set out to ac­\ncomplish with ICWA.

In an ideal world\nparents would never become estranged and leave their\nchildren caught in the middle. But we do not live in\nsuch a world. Even happy families do not always fit the\ncustodial-parent mold for which the majority would reserve\nIWCA’s substantive protections; unhappy families all too\noften do not. They are families nonetheless. Congress\nunderstood as much. ICWA’s definitions of “parent” and\n“termination of parental rights” provided in §1903 sweep\nbroadly. They should be honored.\n                              D\n  The majority does not rely on the theory pressed by\npetitioners and the guardian ad litem that the canon of\nconstitutional avoidance compels the conclusion that ICWA\nis inapplicable here.

Ante, at 1, 3–12. No\nparty advanced this argument, and it is inconsistent with this Court’s\nprecedents holding that Congress has “broad general powers to leg-\nislate in respect to Indian tribes, powers that we have consistently\ndescribed as plenary and exclusive,” founded not only on the Indian\nCommerce Clause but also the Treaty Clause.

The majority’s repeated, analytically\nunnecessary references to the fact that Baby Girl is 3/256\nCherokee by ancestry do nothing to elucidate its intima­\ntion that the statute may violate the Equal Protection\nClause as applied here. See ante, at 1, 6; see also ante,\nat 16 (stating that ICWA “would put certain vulner-\nable children at a great disadvantage solely because an\nancestor—even a remote one—was an Indian” (emphasis\nadded)). I see no ground for this Court to second-guess the\nmembership requirements of federally recognized Indian\ntribes, which are independent political entities. See Santa\nClara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49, 72, n. 32 (1978).\nI am particularly averse to doing so when the Federal\nGovernment requires Indian tribes, as a prerequisite for\nofficial recognition, to make “descen[t] from a historical\nIndian tribe” a condition of membership. 25 CFR §83.7(e)\n(2012).\n   The majority’s treatment of this issue, in the end, does\nno more than create a lingering mood of disapprobation of\nthe criteria for membership adopted by the Cherokee\nNation that, in turn, make Baby Girl an “Indian child”\nunder the statute. Its hints at lurking constitutional\nproblems are, by its own account, irrelevant to its statutory\nanalysis, and accordingly need not detain us any longer.\n                           III\n  Because I would affirm the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt on the ground that §1912 bars the termination of\nBirth Father’s parental rights, I would not reach the\nquestion of the applicability of the adoptive placement\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

I note, however, that the majority\ndoes not and cannot foreclose the possibility that on re­\nmand, Baby Girl’s paternal grandparents or other mem­\nbers of the Cherokee Nation may formally petition for\nadoption of Baby Girl. If these parties do so, and if on\nremand Birth Father’s parental rights are terminated so\nthat an adoption becomes possible, they will then be enti­\ntled to consideration under the order of preference estab­\nlished in §1915. The majority cannot rule prospectively\nthat §1915 would not apply to an adoption petition that\nhas not yet been filed. Indeed, the statute applies “[i]n\nany adoptive placement of an Indian child under State\nlaw,” 25 U. S. C. §1915(a) (emphasis added), and contains\nno temporal qualifications. It would indeed be an odd\nresult for this Court, in the name of the child’s best in-\nterests, cf. ante, at 15, to purport to exclude from the pro­\nceedings possible custodians for Baby Girl, such as her\npaternal grandparents, who may have well-established\nrelationships with her.\n                         *    *    *\n   The majority opinion turns §1912 upside down, reading\nit from bottom to top in order to reach a conclusion that is\nmanifestly contrary to Congress’ express purpose in enact­\ning ICWA: preserving the familial bonds between Indian\nparents and their children and, more broadly, Indian\ntribes’ relationships with the future citizens who are “vital\nto [their] continued existence and integrity.” §1901(3).\n   The majority casts Birth Father as responsible for the\npainful circumstances in this case, suggesting that he\nintervened “at the eleventh hour to override the mother’s\ndecision and the child’s best interests,” ante, at 16. I have\nno wish to minimize the trauma of removing a 27-month­\nold child from her adoptive family. It bears remembering,\nhowever, that Birth Father took action to assert his paren­\ntal rights when Baby Girl was four months old, as soon as\n26            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhe learned of the impending adoption. As the South Caro­\nlina Supreme Court recognized, “ ‘[h]ad the mandate of . . .\nICWA been followed [in 2010], . . . much potential anguish\nmight have been avoided[;] and in any case the law cannot\nbe applied so as automatically to “reward those who obtain\ncustody, whether lawfully or otherwise, and maintain it\nduring any ensuing (and protracted) litigation.” ’ ” 398\nS. C., at 652, 731 S. E. 2d, at 564 (quoting Holyfield, 490\nU. S., at 53–54).\n   The majority’s hollow literalism distorts the statute and\nignores Congress’ purpose in order to rectify a perceived\nwrong that, while heartbreaking at the time, was a correct\napplication of federal law and that in any case cannot be\nundone. Baby Girl has now resided with her father for 18\nmonths. However difficult it must have been for her to\nleave Adoptive Couple’s home when she was just over 2\nyears old, it will be equally devastating now if, at the age\nof 3½, she is again removed from her home and sent to live\nhalfway across the country. Such a fate is not foreor­\ndained, of course. But it can be said with certainty that\nthe anguish this case has caused will only be compounded\nby today’s decision.\n   I believe that the South Carolina Supreme Court’s\njudgment was correct, and I would affirm it.

Argued April 16, 2013—Decided June 25, 2013\nThe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), which establishes feder-\n  al standards for state-court child custody proceedings involving Indi-\n  an children, was enacted to address “the consequences . . . of abusive\n  child welfare practices that [separated] Indian children from their\n  families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement, usual-\n  ly in non-Indian homes,” Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.\n  Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 32. As relevant here, the ICWA bars involun-\n  tary termination of a parent’s rights in the absence of a heightened\n  showing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to result from\n  the parent’s “continued custody” of the child, 25 U. S. C. §1912(f);\n  conditions involuntary termination of parental rights with respect to\n  an Indian child on a showing that remedial efforts have been made to\n  prevent the “breakup of the Indian family,” §1912(d); and provides\n  placement preferences for the adoption of Indian children to members\n  of the child’s extended family, other members of the Indian child’s\n  tribe, and other Indian families, §1915(a).\n     While Birth Mother was pregnant with Biological Father’s child,\n  their relationship ended and Biological Father (a member of the\n  Cherokee Nation) agreed to relinquish his parental rights. Birth\n  Mother put Baby Girl up for adoption through a private adoption\n  agency and selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in South\n  Carolina. For the duration of the pregnancy and the first four\n  months after Baby Girl’s birth, Biological Father provided no finan-\n  cial assistance to Birth Mother or Baby Girl. About four months after\n  Baby Girl’s birth, Adoptive Couple served Biological Father with no-\n  tice of the pending adoption. In the adoption proceedings, Biological\n  Father sought custody and stated that he did not consent to the adop-\n  tion. Following a trial, which took place when Baby Girl was two\n2                  ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    years old, the South Carolina Family Court denied Adoptive Couple’s\n    adoption petition and awarded custody to Biological Father. At the\n    age of 27 months, Baby Girl was handed over to Biological Father,\n    whom she had never met. The State Supreme Court affirmed, con-\n    cluding that the ICWA applied because the child custody proceeding\n    related to an Indian child; that Biological Father was a “parent” un-\n    der the ICWA; that §§1912(d) and (f) barred the termination of his\n    parental rights; and that had his rights been terminated, §1915(a)’s\n    adoption-placement preferences would have applied.\nHeld:\n    1. Assuming for the sake of argument that Biological Father is a\n “parent” under the ICWA, neither §1912(f) nor §1912(d) bars the\n termination of his parental rights. Pp. 6–14.\n       (a) Section 1912(f) conditions the involuntary termination of pa-\n rental rights on a heightened showing regarding the merits of the\n parent’s “continued custody of the child.” The adjective “continued”\n plainly refers to a pre-existing state under ordinary dictionary defini-\n tions. The phrase “continued custody” thus refers to custody that a\n parent already has (or at least had at some point in the past). As a\n result, §1912(f) does not apply where the Indian parent never had\n custody of the Indian child. This reading comports with the statutory\n text, which demonstrates that the ICWA was designed primarily to\n counteract the unwarranted removal of Indian children from Indian\n families. See §1901(4). But the ICWA’s primary goal is not implicat-\n ed when an Indian child’s adoption is voluntarily and lawfully initi-\n ated by a non-Indian parent with sole custodial rights. Nonbinding\n guidelines issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) demonstrate\n that the BIA envisioned that §1912(f)’s standard would apply only to\n termination of a custodial parent’s rights. Under this reading, Bio-\n logical Father should not have been able to invoke §1912(f) in this\n case because he had never had legal or physical custody of Baby Girl\n as of the time of the adoption proceedings. Pp. 7–11.\n       (b) Section §1912(d) conditions an involuntary termination of pa-\n rental rights with respect to an Indian child on a showing “that active\n efforts have been made to provide remedial services . . . designed to\n prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have\n proved unsuccessful.” Consistent with this text, §1912(d) applies on-\n ly when an Indian family’s “breakup” would be precipitated by termi-\n nating parental rights. The term “breakup” refers in this context to\n “[t]he discontinuance of a relationship,” American Heritage Diction-\n ary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or “an ending as an effective entity,” Webster’s\n Third New International Dictionary 273 (1961). But when an Indian\n parent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that child has\n never been in the Indian parent’s legal or physical custody, there is\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  no “relationship” to be “discontinu[ed]” and no “effective entity” to be\n  “end[ed]” by terminating the Indian parent’s rights. In such a situa-\n  tion, the “breakup of the Indian family” has long since occurred, and\n  §1912(d) is inapplicable. This interpretation is consistent with the\n  explicit congressional purpose of setting certain “standards for the\n  removal of Indian children from their families,” §1902, and with BIA\n  Guidelines. Section 1912(d)’s proximity to §§1912(e) and (f), which\n  both condition the outcome of proceedings on the merits of an Indian\n  child’s “continued custody” with his parent, strongly suggests that\n  the phrase “breakup of the Indian family” should be read in harmony\n  with the “continued custody” requirement. Pp. 11–14.\n     2. Section 1915(a)’s adoption-placement preferences are inapplica-\n  ble in cases where no alternative party has formally sought to adopt\n  the child. No party other than Adoptive Couple sought to adopt Baby\n  Girl in the Family Court or the South Carolina Supreme Court. Bio-\n  logical Father is not covered by §1915(a) because he did not seek to\n  adopt Baby Girl; instead, he argued that his parental rights should\n  not be terminated in the first place. And custody was never sought\n  by Baby Girl’s paternal grandparents, other members of the Chero-\n  kee Nation, or other Indian families. Pp. 14–16.\n398 S. C. 625, 731 S.

The\nprovisions of the federal statute at issue here do not de-\nmand this result.\n   Contrary to the State Supreme Court’s ruling, we hold\nthat 25 U. S. C. §1912(f )—which bars involuntary termi-\nnation of a parent’s rights in the absence of a heightened\nshowing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to\nresult from the parent’s “continued custody” of the child—\ndoes not apply when, as here, the relevant parent never\nhad custody of the child. We further hold that §1912(d)—\nwhich conditions involuntary termination of parental\n2                ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrights with respect to an Indian child on a showing that\nremedial efforts have been made to prevent the “breakup\nof the Indian family”—is inapplicable when, as here, the\nparent abandoned the Indian child before birth and never\nhad custody of the child. Finally, we clarify that §1915(a),\nwhich provides placement preferences for the adoption of\nIndian children, does not bar a non-Indian family like\nAdoptive Couple from adopting an Indian child when no\nother eligible candidates have sought to adopt the child.\nWe accordingly reverse the South Carolina Supreme Court’s\njudgment and remand for further proceedings.\n                             I\n   “The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), 92 Stat.\n3069, 25 U. S. C. §§1901–1963, was the product of rising\nconcern in the mid-1970’s over the consequences to In-\ndian children, Indian families, and Indian tribes of abusive\nchild welfare practices that resulted in the separation of\nlarge numbers of Indian children from their families and\ntribes through adoption or foster care placement, usually\nin non-Indian homes.” Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indi-\nans v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 32 (1989). Congress found\nthat “an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families\n[were being] broken up by the removal, often unwarranted,\nof their children from them by nontribal public and\nprivate agencies.” §1901(4). This “wholesale removal of\nIndian children from their homes” prompted Congress to\nenact the ICWA, which establishes federal standards that\ngovern state-court child custody proceedings involving\nIndian children. Id., at 32, 36 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also §1902 (declaring that the ICWA es-\ntablishes “minimum Federal standards for the removal of\nIndian children from their families”).1\n——————\n  1 It is undisputed that Baby Girl is an “Indian child” as defined by the\n\nICWA because she is an unmarried minor who “is eligible for member-\nship in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Three provisions of the ICWA are especially relevant to\nthis case. First, “[a]ny party seeking” an involuntary\ntermination of parental rights to an Indian child under\nstate law must demonstrate that “active efforts have\nbeen made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative\nprograms designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian\nfamily and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.”\n§1912(d). Second, a state court may not involuntarily\nterminate parental rights to an Indian child “in the ab-\nsence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a\nreasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert\nwitnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the\nparent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious\nemotional or physical damage to the child.” §1912(f ).\nThird, with respect to adoptive placements for an Indian\nchild under state law, “a preference shall be given, in the\nabsence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with\n(1) a member of the child’s extended family; (2) other\nmembers of the Indian child’s tribe; or (3) other Indian\nfamilies.” §1915(a).\n                            II\n  In this case, Birth Mother (who is predominantly His-\npanic) and Biological Father (who is a member of the\nCherokee Nation) became engaged in December 2008.\nOne month later, Birth Mother informed Biological Fa-\nther, who lived about four hours away, that she was preg-\nnant. After learning of the pregnancy, Biological Father\n\n—————— \n\nIndian tribe,” §1903(4)(b). See Brief for Respondent Birth Father 1, 51, \n\nn. 22; Brief for Respondent Cherokee Nation 1; Brief for Petitioners 44\n(“Baby Girl’s eligibility for membership in the Cherokee Nation de-\npends solely upon a lineal blood relationship with a tribal ancestor”).\nIt is also undisputed that the present case concerns a “child custody\nproceeding,” which the ICWA defines to include proceedings that\ninvolve “termination of parental rights” and “adoptive placement,”\n§1903(1).\n4             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nasked Birth Mother to move up the date of the wedding.\nHe also refused to provide any financial support until after\nthe two had married. The couple’s relationship deteriorated,\nand Birth Mother broke off the engagement in May 2009.\nIn June, Birth Mother sent Biological Father a text mes-\nsage asking if he would rather pay child support or re-\nlinquish his parental rights. Biological Father responded\nvia text message that he relinquished his rights.\n   Birth Mother then decided to put Baby Girl up for adop-\ntion. Because Birth Mother believed that Biological Fa-\nther had Cherokee Indian heritage, her attorney contacted\nthe Cherokee Nation to determine whether Biological\nFather was formally enrolled. The inquiry letter mis-\nspelled Biological Father’s first name and incorrectly\nstated his birthday, and the Cherokee Nation responded\nthat, based on the information provided, it could not verify\nBiological Father’s membership in the tribal records.\n   Working through a private adoption agency, Birth\nMother selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in\nSouth Carolina, to adopt Baby Girl. Adoptive Couple\nsupported Birth Mother both emotionally and financially\nthroughout her pregnancy. Adoptive Couple was present\nat Baby Girl’s birth in Oklahoma on September 15, 2009,\nand Adoptive Father even cut the umbilical cord. The\nnext morning, Birth Mother signed forms relinquishing\nher parental rights and consenting to the adoption. Adop-\ntive Couple initiated adoption proceedings in South Caro-\nlina a few days later, and returned there with Baby Girl.\nAfter returning to South Carolina, Adoptive Couple al-\nlowed Birth Mother to visit and communicate with Baby\nGirl.\n   It is undisputed that, for the duration of the pregnancy\nand the first four months after Baby Girl’s birth, Biologi-\ncal Father provided no financial assistance to Birth Mother\nor Baby Girl, even though he had the ability to do so. In-\ndeed, Biological Father “made no meaningful attempts\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nto assume his responsibility of parenthood” during this\nperiod. App. to Pet. for Cert. 122a (Sealed; internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   Approximately four months after Baby Girl’s birth,\nAdoptive Couple served Biological Father with notice of\nthe pending adoption. (This was the first notification\nthat they had provided to Biological Father regarding\nthe adoption proceeding.) Biological Father signed papers\nstating that he accepted service and that he was “not\ncontesting the adoption.” App. 37. But Biological Father\nlater testified that, at the time he signed the papers, he\nthought that he was relinquishing his rights to Birth\nMother, not to Adoptive Couple.\n   Biological Father contacted a lawyer the day after sign-\ning the papers, and subsequently requested a stay of the\nadoption proceedings.2 In the adoption proceedings, Bio-\nlogical Father sought custody and stated that he did not\nconsent to Baby Girl’s adoption. Moreover, Biological\nFather took a paternity test, which verified that he was\nBaby Girl’s biological father.\n   A trial took place in the South Carolina Family Court in\nSeptember 2011, by which time Baby Girl was two years\nold. 398 S. C. 625, 634–635, 731 S. E. 2d 550, 555–556\n(2012). The Family Court concluded that Adoptive Couple\nhad not carried the heightened burden under §1912(f ) of\nproving that Baby Girl would suffer serious emotional or\nphysical damage if Biological Father had custody. See id.,\nat 648–651, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562–564. The Family Court\ntherefore denied Adoptive Couple’s petition for adoption\nand awarded custody to Biological Father. Id., at 629,\n636, 731 S. E. 2d, at 552, 556. On December 31, 2011, at\n\n——————\n  2 Around  the same time, the Cherokee Nation identified Biological\nFather as a registered member and concluded that Baby Girl was an\n“Indian child” as defined in the ICWA. The Cherokee Nation inter-\nvened in the litigation approximately three months later.\n6               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe age of 27 months, Baby Girl was handed over to Bio-\nlogical Father, whom she had never met.3\n   The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the Family\nCourt’s denial of the adoption and the award of custody to\nBiological Father. Id., at 629, 731 S. E. 2d, at 552. The\nState Supreme Court first determined that the ICWA\napplied because the case involved a child custody proceed-\ning relating to an Indian child. Id., at 637, 643, n. 18, 731\nS. E. 2d, at 556, 560, n. 18. It also concluded that Biologi-\ncal Father fell within the ICWA’s definition of a “ ‘parent.’ ”\nId., at 644, 731 S. E. 2d, at 560. The court then held that\ntwo separate provisions of the ICWA barred the termina-\ntion of Biological Father’s parental rights. First, the court\nheld that Adoptive Couple had not shown that “active\nefforts ha[d] been made to provide remedial services and\nrehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup\nof the Indian family.” §1912(d); see also id., at 647–648,\n731 S. E. 2d, at 562. Second, the court concluded that\nAdoptive Couple had not shown that Biological Father’s\n“custody of Baby Girl would result in serious emotional or\nphysical harm to her beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at\n648–649, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562–563 (citing §1912(f )). Finally,\nthe court stated that, even if it had decided to terminate\nBiological Father’s parental rights, §1915(a)’s adoption-\nplacement preferences would have applied. Id., at 655–657,\n731 S. E. 2d, at 566–567. We granted certiorari. 568 U.

Moreover, according to\nBirth Mother, Biological Father has made no attempt to contact her\nsince the time he took custody of Baby Girl.\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

E. 2d, at\n560, n. 19 (“Under state law, [Biological] Father’s con-\nsent to the adoption would not have been required”). The\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court held, however, that Biolog-\nical Father is a “parent” under the ICWA and that two\nstatutory provisions—namely, §1912(f ) and §1912(d)—bar\nthe termination of his parental rights. In this Court,\nAdoptive Couple contends that Biological Father is not a\n“parent” and that §1912(f ) and §1912(d) are inapplicable.\nWe need not—and therefore do not—decide whether Bio-\nlogical Father is a “parent.” See §1903(9) (defining “par-\nent”).4 Rather, assuming for the sake of argument that he\nis a “parent,” we hold that neither §1912(f ) nor §1912(d)\nbars the termination of his parental rights.\n                              A\n   Section 1912(f ) addresses the involuntary termination\nof parental rights with respect to an Indian child. Specifi-\ncally, §1912(f ) provides that “[n]o termination of parental\nrights may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of\na determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasona-\nble doubt, . . . that the continued custody of the child by\nthe parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious\nemotional or physical damage to the child.” (Emphasis\nadded.) The South Carolina Supreme Court held that\nAdoptive Couple failed to satisfy §1912(f ) because they did\nnot make a heightened showing that Biological Father’s\n“prospective legal and physical custody” would likely result\nin serious damage to the child. 398 S. C., at 651, 731 S. E.\n2d, at 564 (emphasis added). That holding was error.\n——————\n   4 If Biological Father is not a “parent” under the ICWA, then §1912(f )\n\nand §1912(d)—which relate to proceedings involving possible termina-\ntion of “parental” rights—are inapplicable. Because we conclude that\nthese provisions are inapplicable for other reasons, however, we need\nnot decide whether Biological Father is a “parent.”\n8                ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Section 1912(f ) conditions the involuntary termination\nof parental rights on a showing regarding the merits of\n“continued custody of the child by the parent.” (Emphasis\nadded.) The adjective “continued” plainly refers to a pre-\nexisting state. As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR concedes, post, at\n11 (dissenting opinion) (hereinafter the dissent), “contin-\nued” means “[c]arried on or kept up without cessation”\nor “[e]xtended in space without interruption or breach of\nconne[ct]ion.” Compact Edition of the Oxford English\nDictionary 909 (1981 reprint of 1971 ed.) (Compact OED);\nsee also American Heritage Dictionary 288 (1981) (defin-\ning “continue” in the following manner: “1. To go on with\na particular action or in a particular condition; persist. . . .\n3. To remain in the same state, capacity, or place”); Web-\nster’s Third New International Dictionary 493 (1961)\n(Webster’s) (defining “continued” as “stretching out in time\nor space esp. without interruption”); Aguilar v. FDIC, 63\nF. 3d 1059, 1062 (CA11 1995) (per curiam) (suggesting\nthat the phrase “continue an action” means “go on with . . .\nan action” that is “preexisting”). The term “continued”\nalso can mean “resumed after interruption.” Webster’s\n493; see American Heritage Dictionary 288. The phrase\n“continued custody” therefore refers to custody that a\nparent already has (or at least had at some point in the\npast). As a result, §1912(f ) does not apply in cases where\nthe Indian parent never had custody of the Indian child.5\n  Biological Father’s contrary reading of §1912(f ) is non-\nsensical. Pointing to the provision’s requirement that\n——————\n    5 With\n         a torrent of words, the dissent attempts to obscure the fact\nthat its interpretation simply cannot be squared with the statutory\ntext. A biological father’s “continued custody” of a child cannot be\nassessed if the father never had custody at all, and the use of a differ-\nent phrase—“termination of parental rights”—cannot change that. In\naddition, the dissent’s reliance on subsection headings, post, at 9,\noverlooks the fact that those headings were not actually enacted by\nCongress.

See Brief for\nRespondent Birth Father 39. But it would be absurd to\nthink that Congress enacted a provision that permits\ntermination of a custodial parent’s rights, while simulta-\nneously prohibiting termination of a noncustodial parent’s\nrights. If the statute draws any distinction between\ncustodial and noncustodial parents, that distinction\nsurely does not provide greater protection for noncustodial\nparents.6\n   Our reading of §1912(f ) comports with the statutory text\ndemonstrating that the primary mischief the ICWA was\ndesigned to counteract was the unwarranted removal of\nIndian children from Indian families due to the cultural\ninsensitivity and biases of social workers and state courts.\nThe statutory text expressly highlights the primary prob-\nlem that the statute was intended to solve: “an alarmingly\nhigh percentage of Indian families [were being] broken up\nby the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from\nthem by nontribal public and private agencies.” §1901(4)\n(emphasis added); see also §1902 (explaining that the\nICWA establishes “minimum Federal standards for the\nremoval of Indian children from their families” (emphasis\nadded)); Holyfield, 490 U.

See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 95–1386,\np. 8 (1978) (explaining that, as relevant here, “[t]he pur-\npose of [the ICWA] is to protect the best interests of Indian\nchildren and to promote the stability and security of Indian\ntribes and families by establishing minimum Federal\nstandards for the removal of Indian children from their\nfamilies and the placement of such children in foster or\nadoptive homes” (emphasis added)); id., at 9 (decrying the\n“wholesale separation of Indian children” from their Indian\nfamilies); id., at 22 (discussing “the removal” of Indian\nchildren from their parents pursuant to §§1912(e) and (f )).\nIn sum, when, as here, the adoption of an Indian child is\nvoluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent\nwith sole custodial rights, the ICWA’s primary goal of\npreventing the unwarranted removal of Indian children\nand the dissolution of Indian families is not implicated.\n   The dissent fails to dispute that nonbinding guidelines\nissued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) shortly after\nthe ICWA’s enactment demonstrate that the BIA envi-\nsioned that §1912(f )’s standard would apply only to termi-\nnation of a custodial parent’s rights. Specifically, the BIA\nstated that, under §1912(f ), “[a] child may not be removed\nsimply because there is someone else willing to raise the\nchild who is likely to do a better job”; instead, “[i]t must\nbe shown that . . . it is dangerous for the child to remain\nwith his or her present custodians.” Guidelines for State\nCourts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 44 Fed. Reg.\n67593 (1979) (emphasis added) (hereinafter Guidelines).\nIndeed, the Guidelines recognized that §1912(f ) applies\nonly when there is pre-existing custody to evaluate. See\nibid.

As an initial\nmatter, it is undisputed that Biological Father never had\nphysical custody of Baby Girl. And as a matter of both\nSouth Carolina and Oklahoma law, Biological Father\nnever had legal custody either. See S. C. Code Ann. §63–\n17–20(B) (2010) (“Unless the court orders otherwise, the\ncustody of an illegitimate child is solely in the natural\nmother unless the mother has relinquished her rights to\nthe child”); Okla.

See post, at 17–18, and n. 12 (emphasis\nadded). This is entirely beside the point, because we merely conclude\nthat, based on the statute’s text and structure, Congress did not extend\nthe heightened protections of §1912(d) and §1912(f ) to all biological\nfathers. The fact that state laws may provide certain protections to\nbiological fathers who have abandoned their children and who have\nnever had custody of their children in no way undermines our analysis\nof these two federal statutory provisions.\n12            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfamily and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.”\n(Emphasis added.) The South Carolina Supreme Court\nfound that Biological Father’s parental rights could not\nbe terminated because Adoptive Couple had not demon-\nstrated that Biological Father had been provided remedial\nservices in accordance with §1912(d). 398 S. C., at 647–\n648, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562. We disagree.\n   Consistent with the statutory text, we hold that\n§1912(d) applies only in cases where an Indian family’s\n“breakup” would be precipitated by the termination of the\nparent’s rights. The term “breakup” refers in this context\nto “[t]he discontinuance of a relationship,” American Her-\nitage Dictionary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or “an ending as an\neffective entity,” Webster’s 273 (defining “breakup” as “a\ndisruption or dissolution into component parts: an ending\nas an effective entity”). See also Compact OED 1076\n(defining “break-up” as, inter alia, a “disruption, separa-\ntion into parts, disintegration”). But when an Indian\nparent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that\nchild has never been in the Indian parent’s legal or\nphysical custody, there is no “relationship” that would be\n“discontinu[ed]”—and no “effective entity” that would\nbe “end[ed]”—by the termination of the Indian par-\nent’s rights. In such a situation, the “breakup of the\nIndian family” has long since occurred, and §1912(d) is\ninapplicable.\n   Our interpretation of §1912(d) is, like our interpretation\nof §1912(f ), consistent with the explicit congressional\npurpose of providing certain “standards for the removal of\nIndian children from their families.” §1902 (emphasis\nadded); see also, e.g., §1901(4); Holyfield, 490 U. S., at 32–\n34. In addition, the BIA’s Guidelines confirm that reme-\ndial services under §1912(d) are intended “to alleviate the\nneed to remove the Indian child from his or her parents or\nIndian custodians,” not to facilitate a transfer of the child\nto an Indian parent. See 44 Fed. Reg., at 67592 (emphasis\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

That these three provisions appear adjacent to\neach other strongly suggests that the phrase “breakup of\nthe Indian family” should be read in harmony with the\n“continued custody” requirement. See United Sav. Assn.\nof Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484\nU. S. 365, 371 (1988) (explaining that statutory construc-\ntion “is a holistic endeavor” and that “[a] provision that\nmay seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the\nremainder of the statutory scheme”). None of these three\nprovisions creates parental rights for unwed fathers where\nno such rights would otherwise exist. Instead, Indian\nparents who are already part of an “Indian family” are\nprovided with access to “remedial services and rehabilita-\ntive programs” under §1912(d) so that their “custody”\nmight be “continued” in a way that avoids foster-care\nplacement under §1912(e) or termination of parental\nrights under §1912(f ). In other words, the provision of\n“remedial services and rehabilitative programs” under\n§1912(d) supports the “continued custody” that is protected\nby §1912(e) and §1912(f ).8\n——————\n  8 The dissent claims that our reasoning “necessarily extends to all\n\nIndian parents who have never had custody of their children,” even if\nthose parents have visitation rights. Post, at 2–3, 13–14. As an initial\nmatter, the dissent’s concern about the effect of our decision on individ-\nuals with visitation rights will be implicated, at most, in a relatively\nsmall class of cases. For example, our interpretation of §1912(d) would\nimplicate the dissent’s concern only in the case of a parent who aban-\ndoned his or her child prior to birth and never had physical or legal\ncustody, but did have some sort of visitation rights. Moreover, in cases\nwhere this concern is implicated, such parents might receive “compara-\nble” protections under state law. See post, at 15. And in any event, it is\nthe dissent’s interpretation that would have far-reaching consequences:\n14               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Section 1912(d) is a sensible requirement when applied\nto state social workers who might otherwise be too quick\nto remove Indian children from their Indian families. It\nwould, however, be unusual to apply §1912(d) in the con-\ntext of an Indian parent who abandoned a child prior to\nbirth and who never had custody of the child. The decision\nbelow illustrates this point. The South Carolina Supreme\nCourt held that §1912(d) mandated measures such as\n“attempting to stimulate [Biological] Father’s desire to be\na parent.” 398 S. C., at 647, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562. But if\nprospective adoptive parents were required to engage in\nthe bizarre undertaking of “stimulat[ing]” a biological\nfather’s “desire to be a parent,” it would surely dissuade\nsome of them from seeking to adopt Indian children.9 And\nthis would, in turn, unnecessarily place vulnerable Indian\nchildren at a unique disadvantage in finding a permanent\nand loving home, even in cases where neither an Indian\nparent nor the relevant tribe objects to the adoption.10\n   In sum, the South Carolina Supreme Court erred in\nfinding that §1912(d) barred termination of Biological\nFather’s parental rights.\n                             IV\n     In the decision below, the South Carolina Supreme\n\n——————\nUnder the dissent’s reading, any biological parent—even a sperm\ndonor—would enjoy the heightened protections of §1912(d) and\n§1912(f ), even if he abandoned the mother and the child immediately\nafter conception.

C., at 655–657, 731 S. E. 2d, at 566–567. In so\ndoing, however, the court failed to recognize a critical lim-\nitation on the scope of §1915(a).\n   Section 1915(a) provides that “[i]n any adoptive place-\nment of an Indian child under State law, a preference\nshall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary,\nto a placement with (1) a member of the child’s extended\nfamily; (2) other members of the Indian child’s tribe; or\n(3) other Indian families.” Contrary to the South Carolina\nSupreme Court’s suggestion, §1915(a)’s preferences are\ninapplicable in cases where no alternative party has for-\nmally sought to adopt the child. This is because there\nsimply is no “preference” to apply if no alternative party\nthat is eligible to be preferred under §1915(a) has come\nforward.\n   In this case, Adoptive Couple was the only party that\nsought to adopt Baby Girl in the Family Court or the\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court. See Brief for Petitioners\n19, 55; Brief for Respondent Birth Father 48; Reply Brief\nfor Petitioners 13. Biological Father is not covered by\n§1915(a) because he did not seek to adopt Baby Girl; in-\nstead, he argued that his parental rights should not be\nterminated in the first place.11 Moreover, Baby Girl’s\n——————\n  11 Section 1915(c) also provides that, in the case of an adoptive place-\nment under §1915(a), “if the Indian child’s tribe shall establish a\ndifferent order of preference by resolution, the agency or court effecting\nthe placement shall follow such order so long as the placement is the\nleast restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child,\nas provided in [§1915(b)].” Although we need not decide the issue\nhere, it may be the case that an Indian child’s tribe could alter §1915’s\npreferences in a way that includes a biological father whose rights were\nterminated, but who has now reformed. See §1915(c). If a tribe were to\ntake such an approach, however, the court would still have the power to\ndetermine whether “good cause” exists to disregard the tribe’s order of\n16               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

As the State Supreme Court read\n§§1912(d) and (f ), a biological Indian father could abandon\nhis child in utero and refuse any support for the birth\nmother—perhaps contributing to the mother’s decision to\nput the child up for adoption—and then could play his\nICWA trump card at the eleventh hour to override the\nmother’s decision and the child’s best interests.

Adoption proceedings are adjudicated in state\nfamily courts across the country every day, and “domestic\nrelations” is “an area that has long been regarded as a\nvirtually exclusive province of the States.” Sosna v. Iowa,\n419 U. S. 393, 404 (1975). Indeed, “[t]he whole subject of\nthe domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and\nchild, belongs to the laws of the States and not to the laws\nof the United States.” In re Burrus, 136 U.

BABY GIRL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nhis parental rights via a text message to Birth Mother,\nclaimed a federal right under the ICWA to block the adop-\ntion and to obtain custody.\n   The ICWA establishes “federal standards that govern\nstate-court child custody proceedings involving Indian\nchildren.” Ante, at 2. The ICWA defines “Indian child” as\n“any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is\neither (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible\nfor membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological\nchild of a member of an Indian tribe.” 25 U. S. C. §1903(4).\nAs relevant, the ICWA defines “child custody proceeding,”\n§1903(1), to include “adoptive placement,” which means\n“the permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption,\nincluding any action resulting in a final decree of adop-\ntion,” §1903(1)(iv), and “termination of parental rights,”\nwhich means “any action resulting in the termination of\nthe parent-child relationship,” §1903(1)(ii).\n   The ICWA restricts a state court’s ability to terminate\nthe parental rights of an Indian parent in two relevant\nways. Section 1912(f) prohibits a state court from involun-\ntarily terminating parental rights “in the absence of a\ndetermination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses,\nthat the continued custody of the child by the parent or\nIndian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or\nphysical damage to the child.” Section 1912(d) prohibits a\nstate court from terminating parental rights until the\ncourt is satisfied “that active efforts have been made to\nprovide remedial services and rehabilitative programs\ndesigned to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and\nthat these efforts have proved unsuccessful.” A third\nprovision creates specific placement preferences for the\nadoption of Indian children, which favor placement with\nIndians over other adoptive families. §1915(a). Operating\ntogether, these requirements often lead to different out-\ncomes than would result under state law. That is precisely\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

See ante, at 6 (“It is undisputed\nthat, had Baby Girl not been 3/256 Cherokee, Biological\nFather would have had no right to object to her adoption\nunder South Carolina law”).\n   The ICWA recognizes States’ inherent “jurisdiction over\nIndian child custody proceedings,” §1901(5), but asserts\nthat federal regulation is necessary because States “have\noften failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of\nIndian people and the cultural and social standards pre-\nailing in Indian communities and families,” ibid. However,\nCongress may regulate areas of traditional state concern\nonly if the Constitution grants it such power. Admt. 10\n(“The powers not delegated to the United States by the\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are re-\nserved to the States respectively, or to the people”). The\nthreshold question, then, is whether the Constitution\ngrants Congress power to override state custody law\nwhenever an Indian is involved.\n                              II\n   The ICWA asserts that the Indian Commerce Clause,\nArt. I, §8, cl. 3, and “other constitutional authority” pro-\nvides Congress with “plenary power over Indian affairs.”\n§1901(1). The reference to “other constitutional authority”\nis not illuminating, and I am aware of no other enumer-\nated power that could even arguably support Congress’\nintrusion into this area of traditional state authority. See\nFletcher, The Supreme Court and Federal Indian Policy,\n85 Neb. L. Rev. 121, 137 (2006) (“As a matter of federal\nconstitutional law, the Indian Commerce Clause grants\nCongress the only explicit constitutional authority to deal\nwith Indian tribes”); Natelson, The Original Understand-\ning of the Indian Commerce Clause, 85 Denver U. L. Rev.\n201, 210 (2007) (hereinafter Natelson) (evaluating, and\nrejecting, other potential sources of authority supporting\ncongressional power over Indians).

BABY GIRL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nnary authority must, therefore, stand or fall on Congress’\npower under the Indian Commerce Clause. Although this\nCourt has said that the “central function of the Indian\nCommerce Clause is to provide Congress with plenary\npower to legislate in the field of Indian affairs,” Cotton\nPetroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S. 163, 192 (1989),\nneither the text nor the original understanding of the\nClause supports Congress’ claim to such “plenary” power.\n                              A\n   The Indian Commerce Clause gives Congress authority\n“[t]o regulate Commerce . . . with the Indian tribes.”\nArt. I, §8, cl. 3 (emphasis added). “At the time the original\nConstitution was ratified, ‘commerce’ consisted of selling,\nbuying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these\npurposes.” United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 585\n(1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring). See also 1 S. Johnson, A\nDictionary of the English Language 361 (4th rev. ed. 1773)\n(reprint 1978) (defining commerce as “Intercourse; ex-\nchange of one thing for another; interchange of any thing;\ntrade; traffick”). “[W]hen Federalists and Anti-Federalists\ndiscussed the Commerce Clause during the ratification\nperiod, they often used trade (in its selling/bartering\nsense) and commerce interchangeably.” Lopez, supra, at\n586 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The term “commerce” did\nnot include economic activity such as “manufacturing and\nagriculture,” ibid., let alone noneconomic activity such as\nadoption of children.\n   Furthermore, the term “commerce with Indian tribes”\nwas invariably used during the time of the founding to\nmean “ ‘trade with Indians.’ ” See, e.g., Natelson, 215–216,\nand n. 97 (citing 18th-century sources); Report of Commit-\ntee on Indian Affairs (Feb 20, 1787), in 32 Journals of the\nContinental Congress 1774–1789, pp. 66, 68 (R. Hill ed.\n1936) (hereinafter J. Cont’l Cong.) (using the phrase\n“commerce with the Indians” to mean trade with the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nIndians). And regulation of Indian commerce generally\nreferred to legal structures governing “the conduct of\nthe merchants engaged in the Indian trade, the nature of the\ngoods they sold, the prices charged, and similar matters.”\nNatelson 216, and n. 99.\n  The Indian Commerce Clause contains an additional\ntextual limitation relevant to this case: Congress is given\nthe power to regulate Commerce “with the Indian tribes.”\nThe Clause does not give Congress the power to regulate\ncommerce with all Indian persons any more than the\nForeign Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to\nregulate commerce with all foreign nationals traveling\nwithin the United States. A straightforward reading of\nthe text, thus, confirms that Congress may only regulate\ncommercial interactions—“commerce”—taking place with\nestablished Indian communities—“tribes.” That power is\nfar from “plenary.”\n                              B\n   Congress’ assertion of “plenary power” over Indian\naffairs is also inconsistent with the history of the Indian\nCommerce Clause. At the time of the founding, the Clause\nwas understood to reserve to the States general police\npowers with respect to Indians who were citizens of the\nseveral States. The Clause instead conferred on Congress\nthe much narrower power to regulate trade with Indian\ntribes—that is, Indians who had not been incorporated\ninto the body-politic of any State.\n                             1\n  Before the Revolution, most Colonies adopted their own\nregulations governing Indian trade. See Natelson 219,\nand n. 121 (citing colonial laws). Such regulations were\nnecessary because colonial traders all too often abused\ntheir Indian trading partners, through fraud, exorbitant\nprices, extortion, and physical invasion of Indian territory,\n6                 ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                         THOMAS, J., concurring\n\namong other things. See 1 F. Prucha, The Great Father\n18–20 (1984) (hereinafter Prucha); Natelson 220, and\nn. 122. These abuses sometimes provoked violent Indian\nretaliation. See Prucha 20. To mitigate these conflicts,\nmost Colonies extensively regulated traders engaged in\ncommerce with Indian tribes. See e.g., Ordinance to Regu-\nlate Indian Affairs, Statutes of South Carolina (Aug. 31,\n1751), in 16 Early American Indian Documents: Treaties\nand Laws, 1607–1789, pp. 331–334 (A. Vaughan and\nD. Rosen eds. 1998).1 Over time, commercial regulation at\nthe colonial level proved largely ineffective, in part be-\ncause “[t]here was no uniformity among the colonies, no\ntwo sets of like regulations.” Prucha 21.\n   Recognizing the need for uniform regulation of trade\nwith the Indians, Benjamin Franklin proposed his own\n“articles of confederation” to the Continental Congress on\nJuly 21, 1775, which reflected his view that central control\nover Indian affairs should predominate over local control.\n2 J. Cont’l Cong. 195–199 (W. Ford ed. 1905). Franklin’s\nproposal was not enacted, but in November 1775, Con-\ngress empowered a committee to draft regulations for\nthe Indian trade. 3 id., at 364, 366. On July 12, 1776, the\ncommittee submitted a draft of the Articles of Confedera-\ntion to Congress, which incorporated many of Franklin’s\nproposals. 5 id., at 545, 546, n. 1. The draft prohibited\nStates from waging offensive war against the Indians\nwithout congressional authorization and granted Congress\n\n——————\n   1 South Carolina, for example, required traders to be licensed, to be of\n\ngood moral character, and to post a bond.

Some delegates feared\nthat the Articles gave Congress excessive power to in-\nterfere with States’ jurisdiction over affairs with Indians\nresiding within state boundaries. After further delibera-\ntion, the final result was a clause that included a broad\ngrant of congressional authority with two significant\nexceptions: “The United States in Congress assembled\nshall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of\n. . . regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the\nIndians, not members of any of the States, provided that\nthe legislative right of any State within its own limits be\nnot infringed or violated.” Articles of Confederation, Art.\nIX, cl. 4. As a result, Congress retained exclusive jurisdic-\ntion over Indian affairs outside the borders of the States;\nthe States retained exclusive jurisdiction over relations\nwith Member-Indians;2 and Congress and the States “ex-\nercise[d] concurrent jurisdiction over transactions with\ntribal Indians within state boundaries, but congressional\ndecisions would have to be in compliance with local law.”\nNatelson 230.

Rossiter ed. 1961) (J.\nMadison).\n8             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\ntion reveals the delegates’ concern with protecting the\npower of the States to regulate Indian persons who were\npolitically incorporated into the States. This concern\nfor state power reemerged during the drafting of the\nConstitution.\n                              2\n   The drafting history of the Constitutional Convention\nalso supports a limited construction of the Indian Com-\nmerce Clause. On July 24, 1787, the convention elected\na drafting committee—the Committee of Detail—and\ncharged it to “report a Constitution conformable to the Res-\nolutions passed by the Convention.” 2 Records of the\nFederal Convention of 1787, p.106 (M. Farrand rev. 1966)\n(J. Madison). During the Committee’s deliberations, John\nRutledge, the chairman, suggested incorporating an In-\ndian affairs power into the Constitution. Id., at 137, n. 6,\n143. The first draft reported back to the convention,\nhowever, provided Congress with authority “[t]o regulate\ncommerce with foreign nations, and among the several\nStates,” id., at 181 (Madison) (Aug. 6, 1787), but did not\ninclude any specific Indian affairs clause. On August 18,\nJames Madison proposed that the Federal Government be\ngranted several additional powers, including the power\n“[t]o regulate affairs with the Indians as well within as\nwithout the limits of the U. States.” Id., at 324 (J. Madi-\nson) (emphasis added). On August 22, Rutledge delivered\nthe Committee of Detail’s second report, which modified\nMadison’s proposed clause. The Committee proposed to\nadd to Congress’ power “[t]o regulate commerce with\nforeign nations, and among the several States” the words,\n“and with Indians, within the Limits of any State, not\nsubject to the laws thereof.” Id., at 366–367 (Journal).\nThe Committee’s version, which echoed the Articles of\nConfederation, was far narrower than Madison’s proposal.\nOn August 31, the revised draft was submitted to a Com-\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

That Committee recommended adding\nto the Commerce Clause the phrase, “and with the Indian\ntribes,” id., at 493, which the Convention ultimately\nadopted.\n   It is, thus, clear that the Framers of the Constitution\nwere alert to the difference between the power to regulate\ntrade with the Indians and the power to regulate all In-\ndian affairs. By limiting Congress’ power to the former, the\nFramers declined to grant Congress the same broad pow-\ners over Indian affairs conferred by the Articles of Confed-\neration. See Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89\nCornell L. Rev. 1069, 1090 (2004).\n   During the ratification debates, opposition to the Indian\nCommerce Clause was nearly nonexistent. See Natelson\n248 (noting that Robert Yates, a New York Anti-Federalist\nwas “almost the only writer who objected to any part [of ]\nof the Commerce Clause—a clear indication that its scope\nwas understood to be fairly narrow” (footnote omitted)).\nGiven the Anti-Federalists’ vehement opposition to the\nConstitution’s other grants of power to the Federal Gov-\nernment, this silence is revealing. The ratifiers almost\ncertainly understood the Clause to confer a relatively\nmodest power on Congress—namely, the power to regulate\ntrade with Indian tribes living beyond state borders. And\nthis feature of the Constitution was welcomed by Federal-\nists and Anti-Federalists alike due to the considerable\ninterest in expanding trade with such Indian tribes. See,\ne.g., The Federalist No. 42, at 265 (J. Madison) (praising\nthe Constitution for removing the obstacles that had\nexisted under the Articles of Confederation to federal\ncontrol over “trade with Indians” (emphasis added)); 3 J.\nElliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on\nthe Adoption of the Federal Constitution 580 (2d ed. 1863)\n(Adam Stephens, at the Virginia ratifying convention,\nJune 23, 1788, describing the Indian tribes residing near\n10            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Saladino eds.\n2012) (conceding that there must be a standing army for\nsome purposes, including “trade with Indians”). There is\nlittle evidence that the ratifiers of the Constitution under-\nstood the Indian Commerce Clause to confer anything\nresembling plenary power over Indian affairs. See Natel-\nson 247–250.\n                            III\n  In light of the original understanding of the Indian\nCommerce Clause, the constitutional problems that would\nbe created by application of the ICWA here are evident.\nFirst, the statute deals with “child custody proceedings,”\n§1903(1), not “commerce.” It was enacted in response to\nconcerns that “an alarmingly high percentage of Indian\nfamilies [were] broken up by the removal, often unwar-\nranted, of their children from them by nontribal public\nand private agencies.” §1901(4). The perceived problem\nwas that many Indian children were “placed in non-Indian\nfoster and adoptive homes and institutions.” Ibid. This\nproblem, however, had nothing to do with commerce.\n  Second, the portions of the ICWA at issue here do not\nregulate Indian tribes as tribes. Sections 1912(d) and (f ),\nand §1915(a) apply to all child custody proceedings involv-\ning an Indian child, regardless of whether an Indian tribe\nis involved. This case thus does not directly implicate\nCongress’ power to “legislate in respect to Indian tribes.”\nUnited States v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193, 200 (2004) (emphasis\nadded). Baby Girl was never domiciled on an Indian\nReservation, and the Cherokee Nation had no jurisdiction\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                  11\n\n                        THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nover her. Cf. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.\nHolyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 53–54 (1989) (holding that the\nIndian Tribe had exclusive jurisdiction over child custody\nproceedings, even though the children were born off the\nreservation, because the children were “domiciled” on the\nreservation for purposes of the ICWA). Although Birth\nFather is a registered member of The Cherokee Nation, he\ndid not live on a reservation either. He was, thus, subject\nto the laws of the State in which he resided (Oklahoma)\nand of the State where his daughter resided during the\ncustody proceedings (South Carolina). Nothing in the In-\ndian Commerce Clause permits Congress to enact spe-\ncial laws applicable to Birth Father merely because of his\nstatus as an Indian.3\n  Because adoption proceedings like this one involve\nneither “commerce” nor “Indian tribes,” there is simply no\nconstitutional basis for Congress’ assertion of authority\nover such proceedings. Also, the notion that Congress can\ndirect state courts to apply different rules of evidence and\nprocedure merely because a person of Indian descent is\ninvolved raises absurd possibilities. Such plenary power\nwould allow Congress to dictate specific rules of criminal\nprocedure for state-court prosecutions against Indian\ndefendants. Likewise, it would allow Congress to substi-\ntute federal law for state law when contract disputes\ninvolve Indians. But the Constitution does not grant\nCongress power to override state law whenever that law\n\n——————\n  3 Petitioners and the guardian ad litem contend that applying the\n\nICWA to child custody proceedings on the basis of race implicates equal\nprotection concerns. See Brief for Petitioners 45 (arguing that the\nstatute would be unconstitutional “if unwed fathers with no preexisting\nsubstantive parental rights receive a statutory preference based solely\non the Indian child’s race”); Brief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem\n48–49 (same). I need not address this argument because I am satisfied\nthat Congress lacks authority to regulate the child custody proceedings\nin this case.\n12            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

First,\nthe statute does not directly explain how to treat an ab-\nsentee Indian father who had next-to-no involvement with\nhis child in the first few months of her life. That category\nof fathers may include some who would prove highly un-\nsuitable parents, some who would be suitable, and a range\nof others in between. Most of those who fall within that\ncategory seem to fall outside the scope of the language of\n25 U. S. C. §§1912(d) and (f ). Thus, while I agree that the\nbetter reading of the statute is, as the majority concludes,\nto exclude most of those fathers, ante, at 8, 12, I also un-\nderstand the risk that, from a policy perspective, the\nCourt’s interpretation could prove to exclude too many.\nSee post, at 13, 22–23 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).\n   Second, we should decide here no more than is neces-\nsary. Thus, this case does not involve a father with visita-\ntion rights or a father who has paid “all of his child\nsupport obligations.” See post, at 13. Neither does it involve\nspecial circumstances such as a father who was deceived\nabout the existence of the child or a father who was pre-\nvented from supporting his child. See post, at 13 n. 8. The\nCourt need not, and in my view does not, now decide\nwhether or how §§1912(d) and (f ) apply where those cir-\n2              ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                      BREYER, J., concurring\n\ncumstances are present.\n  Third, other statutory provisions not now before us may\nnonetheless prove relevant in cases of this kind. Section\n1915(a) grants an adoptive “preference” to “(1) a member\nof the child’s extended family; (2) other members of the\nIndian child’s tribe; or (3) other Indian families . . . . in the\nabsence of good cause to the contrary.” Further, §1915(c)\nallows the “Indian child’s tribe” to “establish a different\norder of preference by resolution.” Could these provisions\nallow an absentee father to re-enter the special statutory\norder of preference with support from the tribe, and sub-\nject to a court’s consideration of “good cause?” I raise, but\ndo not here try to answer, the question.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

I reject the conclusion that the Court draws from\nthe words “continued custody” in 25 U. S. C §1912(f) not\nbecause “literalness may strangle meaning,” see post, at\n11, but because there is no reason that “continued” must\nrefer to custody in the past rather than custody in the\nfuture. I read the provision as requiring the court to\nsatisfy itself (beyond a reasonable doubt) not merely that\ninitial or temporary custody is not “likely to result in\nserious emotional or physical damage to the child,” but\nthat continued custody is not likely to do so. See Web-\nster’s New International Dictionary 577 (2d ed. 1950)\n(defining “continued” as “[p]rotracted in time or space, esp.\nwithout interruption; constant”). For the reasons set forth\nin JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s dissent, that connotation is much\nmore in accord with the rest of the statute.\n  While I am at it, I will add one thought. The Court’s\nopinion, it seems to me, needlessly demeans the rights of\nparenthood. It has been the constant practice of the com-\nmon law to respect the entitlement of those who bring a\nchild into the world to raise that child. We do not inquire\nwhether leaving a child with his parents is “in the best\ninterest of the child.” It sometimes is not; he would be\n2             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

In truth, however, the path from the text of\nthe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) to the result the\nCourt reaches is anything but clear, and its result any­\nthing but right.\n   The reader’s first clue that the majority’s supposedly\nstraightforward reasoning is flawed is that not all Mem­\nbers who adopt its interpretation believe it is compelled by\nthe text of the statute, see ante, at 1 (THOMAS, J., concur­\nring); nor are they all willing to accept the consequences\nit will necessarily have beyond the specific factual sce-\nnario confronted here, see ante, at 1 (BREYER, J., concurring).\nThe second clue is that the majority begins its analysis by\nplucking out of context a single phrase from the last clause\nof the last subsection of the relevant provision, and then\nbuilds its entire argument upon it. That is not how we\nordinarily read statutes. The third clue is that the major-\nity openly professes its aversion to Congress’ explicitly\nstated purpose in enacting the statute. The majority ex-\n2             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npresses concern that reading the Act to mean what it\nsays will make it more difficult to place Indian children in\nadoptive homes, see ante, at 14, 16, but the Congress that\nenacted the statute announced its intent to stop “an\nalarmingly high percentage of Indian families [from being]\nbroken up” by, among other things, a trend of “plac[ing]\n[Indian children] in non-Indian . . . adoptive homes.” 25\nU. S. C. §1901(4). Policy disagreement with Congress’ judg-\nment is not a valid reason for this Court to distort the pro­\nvisions of the Act. Unlike the majority, I cannot adopt\na reading of ICWA that is contrary to both its text and its\nstated purpose. I respectfully dissent.\n                               I\n  Beginning its reading with the last clause of §1912(f ),\nthe majority concludes that a single phrase appearing\nthere—“continued custody”—means that the entirety of\nthe subsection is inapplicable to any parent, however\ncommitted, who has not previously had physical or legal\ncustody of his child. Working back to front, the majority\nthen concludes that §1912(d), tainted by its association\nwith §1912(f ), is also inapplicable; in the majority’s view,\na family bond that does not take custodial form is not a\nfamily bond worth preserving from “breakup.” Because\nthere are apparently no limits on the contaminating power\nof this single phrase, the majority does not stop there.\nUnder its reading, §1903(9), which makes biological fa­\nthers “parent[s]” under this federal statute (and where,\nagain, the phrase “continued custody” does not appear),\nhas substantive force only when a birth father has physi­\ncal or state-recognized legal custody of his daughter.\n  When it excludes noncustodial biological fathers from\nthe Act’s substantive protections, this textually backward\nreading misapprehends ICWA’s structure and scope.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the majority’s focus on the per-\nceived parental shortcomings of Birth Father, its rea­\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

The majority thereby trans­\nforms a statute that was intended to provide uniform\nfederal standards for child custody proceedings involving\nIndian children and their biological parents into an illogi­\ncal piecemeal scheme.\n                               A\n   Better to start at the beginning and consider the opera­\ntion of the statute as a whole. Cf. ante, at 13 (“[S]tatutory\nconstruction ‘is a holistic endeavor[,]’ and . . . ‘[a] provision\nthat may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by\nthe remainder of the statutory scheme’ ” (quoting United\nSav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates,\nLtd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988))).\n   ICWA commences with express findings. Congress rec­\nognized that “there is no resource that is more vital to\nthe continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than\ntheir children,” 25 U. S. C. §1901(3), and it found that this\nresource was threatened. State authorities insufficiently\nsensitive to “the essential tribal relations of Indian people\nand the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian\ncommunities and families” were breaking up Indian fami­\nlies and moving Indian children to non-Indian homes and\ninstitutions. See §§1901(4)–(5). As §1901(4) makes clear,\nand as this Court recognized in Mississippi Band of\nChoctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 33 (1989),\nadoptive placements of Indian children with non-Indian\nfamilies contributed significantly to the overall problem. See\n§1901(4) (finding that “an alarmingly high percentage of\n[Indian] children are placed in non-Indian . . . adoptive\nhomes”).\n   Consistent with these findings, Congress declared its\npurpose “to protect the best interests of Indian children\n4             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nand to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes\nand families by the establishment of minimum Federal\nstandards” applicable to child custody proceedings involv­\ning Indian children. §1902. Section 1903 then goes on to\nestablish the reach of these protections through its defi-\nnitional provisions. For present purposes, two of these\ndefinitions are crucial to understanding the statute’s full\nscope.\n   First, ICWA defines the term “parent” broadly to mean\n“any biological parent . . . of an Indian child or any In-\ndian person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child.”\n§1903(9). It is undisputed that Baby Girl is an “Indian\nchild” within the meaning of the statute, see §1903(4);\nante, at 2, n. 1, and Birth Father consequently qualifies\nas a “parent” under the Act. The statutory definition of\nparent “does not include the unwed father where paternity\nhas not been acknowledged or established,” §1903(9), but\nBirth Father’s biological paternity has never been ques­\ntioned by any party and was confirmed by a DNA test\nduring the state court proceedings, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n109a (Sealed).\n   Petitioners and Baby Girl’s guardian ad litem devote\nmany pages of briefing to arguing that the term “parent”\nshould be defined with reference to the law of the State in\nwhich an ICWA child custody proceeding takes place. See\nBrief for Petitioners 19–29; Brief for Respondent Guardian\nAd Litem 32–41. These arguments, however, are incon­\nsistent with our recognition in Holyfield that Congress\nintended the critical terms of the statute to have uniform\nfederal definitions. See 490 U. S., at 44–45. It is therefore\nunsurprising, although far from unimportant, that the\nmajority assumes for the purposes of its analysis that\nBirth Father is an ICWA “parent.” See ante, at 7.\n   Second, the Act’s comprehensive definition of “child\ncustody proceeding” includes not only “ ‘adoptive place­\nment[s],’ ” “ ‘preadoptive placement[s],’ ” and “ ‘foster care\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                  5\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nplacement[s],’ ” but also “ ‘termination of parental rights’ ”\nproceedings. §1903(1). This last category encompasses\n“any action resulting in the termination of the parent-\nchild relationship,” §1903(1)(ii) (emphasis added). So far,\nthen, it is clear that Birth Father has a federally recog­\nnized status as Baby Girl’s “parent” and that his “parent­\nchild relationship” with her is subject to the protections of\nthe Act.\n  These protections are numerous. Had Birth Father\npetitioned to remove this proceeding to tribal court, for\nexample, the state court would have been obligated to\ntransfer it absent an objection from Birth Mother or good\ncause to the contrary. See §1911(b). Any voluntary con­\nsent Birth Father gave to Baby Girl’s adoption would have\nbeen invalid unless written and executed before a judge\nand would have been revocable up to the time a final\ndecree of adoption was entered.1 See §§1913(a), (c). And\n§1912, the center of the dispute here, sets forth procedural\nand substantive standards applicable in “involuntary\nproceeding[s] in a State court,” including foster care\nplacements of Indian children and termination of paren­\ntal rights proceedings. §1912(a). I consider §1912’s provi­\nsions in order.\n  Section 1912(a) requires that any party seeking “termi­\nnation of parental rights t[o] an Indian child” provide\nnotice to both the child’s “parent or Indian custodian”\nand the child’s tribe “of the pending proceedings and of\ntheir right of intervention.” Section 1912(b) mandates\nthat counsel be provided for an indigent “parent or In-\ndian custodian” in any “termination proceeding.” Section\n——————\n  1 For this reason, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that Birth\n\nFather did not give valid consent to Baby Girl’s adoption when, four\nmonths after her birth, he signed papers stating that he accepted\nservice and was not contesting the adoption. See 398 S. C. 625, 645–\n646, 731 S. E. 2d 550, 561 (2012). See also ante, at 5. Petitioners do\nnot challenge this aspect of the South Carolina court’s holding.\n6                     ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                           SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n1912(c) also gives all “part[ies]” to a termination proceed­\ning—which, thanks to §§1912(a) and (b), will always in­\nclude a biological father if he desires to be present—the\nright to inspect all material “reports or other documents\nfiled with the court.” By providing notice, counsel, and\naccess to relevant documents, the statute ensures a biolog­\nical father’s meaningful participation in an adoption pro­\nceeding where the termination of his parental rights is at\nissue.\n   These protections are consonant with the principle,\nrecognized in our cases, that the biological bond between\nparent and child is meaningful. “[A] natural parent’s\ndesire for and right to the companionship, care, custody,\nand management of his or her children,” we have ex­\nplained, “is an interest far more precious than any prop-\nerty right.” Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 758–759\n(1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also infra,\nat 19-20. Although the Constitution does not compel the\nprotection of a biological father’s parent-child relationship\nuntil he has taken steps to cultivate it, this Court has\nnevertheless recognized that “the biological connection . . .\noffers the natural father an opportunity that no other\nmale possesses to develop a relationship with his off­\nspring.” Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248, 262 (1983).\nFederal recognition of a parent-child relationship between\na birth father and his child is consistent with ICWA’s\npurpose of providing greater protection for the familial\nbonds between Indian parents and their children than\nstate law may afford.\n   The majority does not and cannot reasonably dispute\nthat ICWA grants biological fathers, as “parent[s],” the\nright to be present at a termination of parental rights\nproceeding and to have their views and claims heard\nthere.2 But the majority gives with one hand and takes\n——————\n    2 Petitioners   concede that, assuming Birth Father is a “parent” under\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

Having assumed a uniform federal\ndefinition of “parent” that confers certain procedural\nrights, the majority then illogically concludes that ICWA’s\nsubstantive protections are available only to a subset of\n“parent[s]”: those who have previously had physical or\nstate-recognized legal custody of his or her child. The\nstatute does not support this departure.\n  Section 1912(d) provides that\n        “Any party seeking to effect a foster care placement\n     of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child\n     under State law shall satisfy the court that active\n     efforts have been made to provide remedial services\n     and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the\n     breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts\n     have proved unsuccessful.” (Emphasis added.)\nIn other words, subsection (d) requires that an attempt\nbe made to cure familial deficiencies before the drastic\nmeasures of foster care placement or termination of paren­\ntal rights can be taken.\n  The majority would hold that the use of the phrase\n“breakup of the Indian family” in this subsection means\nthat it does not apply where a birth father has not previ­\nously had custody of his child. Ante, at 12. But there is\nnothing about this capacious phrase that licenses such a\nnarrowing construction. As the majority notes, “breakup”\nmeans “ ‘[t]he discontinuance of a relationship.’ ” Ante, at\n12 (quoting American Heritage Dictionary 235 (3d ed.\n1992)). So far, all of §1912’s provisions expressly apply in\nactions aimed at terminating the “parent-child relation­\nship” that exists between a birth father and his child, and\nthey extend to it meaningful protections. As a logical\nmatter, that relationship is fully capable of being pre­\n\n—————— \n\nICWA, the notice and counsel provisions of 25 U. S. C. §§1912(a) and (b)\n\napply to him.

Nothing in the text of subsection (d)\nindicates that this blood relationship should be excluded\nfrom the category of familial “relationships” that the pro-\nvision aims to save from “discontinuance.”\n   The majority, reaching the contrary conclusion, asserts\nbaldly that “when an Indian parent abandons an Indian\nchild prior to birth and that child has never been in the\nIndian parent’s legal or physical custody, there is no ‘rela­\ntionship’ that would be ‘discontinu[ed]’ . . . by the termina­\ntion of the Indian parent’s rights.” Ante, at 12. Says who?\nCertainly not the statute. Section 1903 recognizes Birth\nFather as Baby Girl’s “parent,” and, in conjunction with\nICWA’s other provisions, it further establishes that their\n“parent-child relationship” is protected under federal law.\nIn the face of these broad definitions, the majority has no\nwarrant to substitute its own policy views for Congress’ by\nsaying that “no ‘relationship’ ” exists between Birth Father\nand Baby Girl simply because, based on the hotly con-\ntested facts of this case, it views their family bond as in-\nsufficiently substantial to deserve protection.3 Ibid.\n   The majority states that its “interpretation of §1912(d)\nis . . . confirmed by the provision’s placement next to\n——————\n  3 The majority’s discussion of §1912(d) repeatedly references Birth\n\nFather’s purported “abandon[ment]” of Baby Girl, ante, at 12, 13, n. 8,\n14, and it contends that its holding with regard to this provision is\nlimited to such circumstances, see ante, at 13, n. 8; see also ante, at 1\n(BREYER, J., concurring). While I would welcome any limitations on the\nmajority’s holding given that it is contrary to the language and purpose\nof the statute, the majority never explains either the textual basis or\nthe precise scope of its “abandon[ment]” limitation. I expect that the\nmajority’s inexact use of the term “abandon[ment]” will sow confusion,\nbecause it is a commonly used term of art in state family law that does\nnot have a uniform meaning from State to State. See generally 1 J.\nHollinger, Adoption Law and Practice §4.04[1][a][ii] (2012) (discussing\nvarious state-law standards for establishing parental abandonment of\na child).\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

This is the only aspect of\nthe majority’s argument regarding §1912(d) that is based\non ICWA’s actual text rather than layers of assertion su-\nperimposed on the text; but the conclusion the majority\ndraws from the juxtaposition of these provisions is exactly\nbackward.\n  Section 1912(f ) is paired with §1912(e), and as the ma­\njority notes, both come on the heels of the requirement of\nrehabilitative efforts just reviewed. The language of the\ntwo provisions is nearly identical; subsection (e) is headed\n“Foster care placement orders,” and subsection (f ), the\nrelevant provision here, is headed “Parental rights termi­\nnation orders.” Subsection (f ) reads in its entirety,\n       “No termination of parental rights may be ordered\n     in such proceeding in the absence of a determination,\n     supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, in­\n     cluding testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that\n     the continued custody of the child by the parent or In­\n     dian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional\n     or physical damage to the child.” §1912(f ).4\nThe immediate inference to be drawn from the statute’s\nstructure is that subsections (e) and (f ) work in tandem\nwith the rehabilitative efforts required by (d). Under\nsubsection (d), state authorities must attempt to provide\n“remedial services and rehabilitative programs” aimed at\navoiding foster care placement or termination of parental\nrights; (e) and (f ), in turn, bar state authorities from order­\n——————\n  4 The full text of subsection (e) is as follows:\n   “No foster care placement may be ordered in such proceeding in\nthe absence of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evi-\ndence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the\ncontinued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is\nlikely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.”\n§1912(e).\n10               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Nothing in\nsubsections (a) through (d) suggests a limitation on the\ntypes of parental relationships that are protected by any of\nthe provisions of §1912, and there is nothing in the struc­\nture of §1912 that would lead a reader to expect subsection\n(e) or (f ) to introduce any such qualification. Indeed, both\nsubsections, in their opening lines, refer back to the prior\nprovisions of §1912 with the phrase “in such proceeding.”\nThis language indicates, quite logically, that in actions\nwhere subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) apply, (e) and (f )\napply too.5\n   All this, and still the most telling textual evidence is yet\nto come: The text of the subsection begins by announcing,\n“[n]o termination of parental rights may be ordered” un­\nless the specified evidentiary showing is made. To repeat,\na “termination of parental rights” includes “any action\nresulting in the termination of the parent-child relation­\nship,” 25 U. S. C. §1903(1)(ii) (emphasis added), includ-\ning the relationship Birth Father, as an ICWA “parent,”\nhas with Baby Girl. The majority’s reading disregards\nthe Act’s sweeping definition of “termination of parental\nrights,” which is not limited to terminations of custodial\nrelationships.\n  The entire foundation of the majority’s argument that\n——————\n   5 For these reasons, I reject the argument advanced by the United\n\nStates that subsection (d) applies in the circumstances of this case but\nsubsection (f ) does not. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n24–26. The United States’ position is contrary to the interrelated\nnature of §§1912(d), (e), and (f ). Under the reading that the United\nStates proposes, in a case such as this one the curative provision would\nstand alone; ICWA would provide no evidentiary or substantive stand­\nards by which to measure whether foster care placement or termination\nof parental rights could be ordered in the event that rehabilitative\nefforts did not succeed. Such a scheme would be oddly incomplete.\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

Emphasizing\nthat Birth Father never had physical custody or, under\nstate law, legal custody of Baby Girl, the majority finds\nthe statute inapplicable here. Ante, at 10–11. But “liter­\nalness may strangle meaning.” Utah Junk Co. v. Porter,\n328 U. S. 39, 44 (1946). See also Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,\n519 U. S. 337, 341–345 (1997) (noting that a term that\nmay “[a]t first blush” seem unambiguous can prove other­\nwise when examined in the context of the statute as a\nwhole).6 In light of the structure of §1912, which indicates\nthat subsection (f ) is applicable to the same actions to\nwhich subsections (a) through (d) are applicable; the use of\nthe phrase “such proceeding[s]” at the start of subsection\n(f ) to reinforce this structural inference; and finally, the\nprovision’s explicit statement that it applies to “termina­\ntion of parental rights” proceedings, the necessary conclu­\nsion is that the word “custody” does not strictly denote a\nstate-recognized custodial relationship. If one refers back\nto the Act’s definitional section, this conclusion is not\nsurprising. Section 1903(1) includes “any action resulting\nin the termination of the parent-child relationship” within\nthe meaning of “child custody proceeding,” thereby belying\nany congressional intent to give the term “custody” a\nnarrow and exclusive definition throughout the statute.\n——————\n   6 The majority’s interpretation is unpersuasive even if one focuses\n\nexclusively on the phrase “continued custody” because, as JUSTICE\nSCALIA explains, ante, at 1 (dissenting opinion), nothing about the\nadjective “continued” mandates the retrospective, rather than prospec­\ntive, application of §1912(f )’s standard.\n12               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   In keeping with §1903(1) and the structure and lan­\nguage of §1912 overall, the phrase “continued custody” is\nmost sensibly read to refer generally to the continuation of\nthe parent-child relationship that an ICWA “parent” has\nwith his or her child. A court applying §1912(f ) where the\nparent does not have pre-existing custody should, as Birth\nFather argues, determine whether the party seeking ter­\nmination of parental rights has established that the con­\ntinuation of the parent-child relationship will result in\n“serious emotional or physical damage to the child.”7\n   The majority is willing to assume, for the sake of argu­\nment, that Birth Father is a “parent” within the meaning\nof ICWA. But the majority fails to account for all that\nfollows from that assumption. The majority repeatedly\npasses over the term “termination of parental rights” that,\nas defined by §1903, clearly encompasses an action aimed\nat severing Birth Father’s “parent-child relationship” with\nBaby Girl. The majority chooses instead to focus on\nphrases not statutorily defined that it then uses to exclude\nBirth Father from the benefits of his parental status.\nWhen one must disregard a statute’s use of terms that\nhave been explicitly defined by Congress, that should be a\nsignal that one is distorting, rather than faithfully read­\ning, the law in question.\n                              B\n     The majority also does not acknowledge the full impli­\n——————\n  7 The majority overlooks Birth Father’s principal arguments when it\n\ndismisses his reading of §1912(f ) as “nonsensical.” Ante, at 8.

But it offers no\nsupport for this assertion, beyond speculating that there will not be\nmany fathers affected by its interpretation of §1912(d) because it is\nqualified by an “abandon[ment]” limitation. Ibid. Tellingly, the major-\nity has nothing to say about §1912(f ), despite the fact that its interpre­\ntation of that provision is not limited in a similar way. In any event,\nthis example by no means exhausts the class of semiprotected ICWA\nparents that the majority’s opinion creates. It also includes, for exam­\nple, biological fathers who have not yet established a relationship with\ntheir child because the child’s mother never informed them of the\npregnancy, see, e.g., In re Termination of Parental Rights of Biological\nParents of Baby Boy W., 1999 OK 74, 988 P. 2d 1270, told them falsely\nthat the pregnancy ended in miscarriage or termination, see, e.g., A\nChild’s Hope, LLC v. Doe, 178 N. C. App. 96, 630 S. E. 2d 673 (2006), or\notherwise obstructed the father’s involvement in the child’s life, see,\ne.g., In re Baby Girl W., 728 S. W. 2d 545 (Mo. App. 1987) (birth mother\nmoved and did not inform father of her whereabouts); In re Petition of\nDoe, 159 Ill. 2d 347, 638 N. E. 2d 181 (1994) (father paid pregnancy\nexpenses until birth mother cut off contact with him and told him that\ntheir child had died shortly after birth). And it includes biological\nfathers who did not contribute to pregnancy expenses because they\nwere unable to do so, whether because the father lacked sufficient\nmeans, the expenses were covered by a third party, or the birth mother\ndid not pass on the relevant bills. See, e.g., In re Adoption of B. V.,\n2001 UT App 290, ¶¶ 24–31, 33 P. 3d 1083, 1087–1088.\n14                ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Presumably the court con­\nsidering the adoption petition would have to apply some\nstandard to determine whether termination of his paren­\ntal rights was appropriate.

Ante, at 13–14, n. 8. If\nthere are any examples of women who go to the trouble and expense of\nartificial insemination and then carry the child to term, only to put the\nchild up for adoption or be found so unfit as mothers that state authori­\nties attempt an involuntary adoptive placement—thereby necessitating\ntermination of the parental rights of the sperm donor father—the ma­\njority does not cite them. As between a possibly overinclusive in­\nterpretation of the statute that covers this unlikely class of cases, and\nthe majority’s underinclusive interpretation that has the very real\nconsequence of denying ICWA’s protections to all noncustodial biologi­\ncal fathers, it is surely the majority’s reading that is contrary to ICWA’s\ndesign.\n   9 With a few exceptions not relevant here, before a final decree of\n\nadoption may be entered, one of two things must happen: “the biological\nparents must either voluntarily relinquish their parental rights or have\ntheir rights involuntarily terminated.” 2A.

There is no reason to believe\nCongress wished to leave protection of the parental rights\nof a subset of ICWA “parent[s]” dependent on the happen­\nstance of where a particular “child custody proceeding”\ntakes place.

In any event, the question is a nonissue\nin this case given the family court’s finding that Birth\nFather is “a fit and proper person to have custody of his\nchild” who “has demonstrated [his] ability to parent effec­\ntively” and who possesses “unwavering love for this child.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 128a (Sealed).

The implicit argu­\nment is that Congress could not possibly have intended to\nrecognize a parent-child relationship between Birth Fa­\nther and Baby Girl that would have to be legally termi­\nnated (either by valid consent or involuntary termination) \n\nbefore the adoption could proceed. \n\n—————— \n\n   11 The majority’s concerns about what might happen if no state or\n\ntribal authority stepped in to provide remedial services are therefore\nirrelevant here.

But as a general matter, if a parent\nhas rights that are an obstacle to an adoption, the state- and federal­\nlaw safeguards of those rights must be honored, irrespective of pro­\nspective adoptive parents’ understandable and valid desire to see the\nadoption finalized. “We must remember that the purpose of an adop­\ntion is to provide a home for a child, not a child for a home.” In re\nPetition of Doe, 159 Ill. 2d, at 368, 638 N.

See, e.g.,\nIn re Adoption of Tobias D., 2012 Me. 45, ¶27, 40 A. 3d\n990, 999 (recognizing that award of custody of 2½-year-old\nchild to biological father under applicable state law once\npaternity is established will result in the “difficult and pain-\nful” necessity of “removing the child from the only home\nhe has ever known”). On the other hand, these rules\nrecognize that biological fathers have a valid interest in a\nrelationship with their child. See supra, at 6. And chil­\ndren have a reciprocal interest in knowing their biological\nparents. See Santosky, 455 U. S., at 760–761, n. 11 (de­\nscribing the foreclosure of a newborn child’s opportunity to\n“ever know his natural parents” as a “los[s] [that] cannot\nbe measured”). These rules also reflect the understanding\nthat the biological bond between a parent and a child is a\nstrong foundation on which a stable and caring relation­\nship may be built. Many jurisdictions apply a custodial\npreference for a fit natural parent over a party lacking\nthis biological link. See, e.g., Ex parte Terry, 494 So. 2d\n628, 632 (Ala. 1986); Appeal of H.

This pref­\nerence is founded in the “presumption that fit parents act\nin the best interests of their children.” Troxel v. Granville,\n530 U.

(quoting Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 602 (1979)).\n   Balancing the legitimate interests of unwed biological\nfathers against the need for stability in a child’s family\nsituation is difficult, to be sure, and States have, over the\nyears, taken different approaches to the problem. Some\nStates, like South Carolina, have opted to hew to the con­\nstitutional baseline established by this Court’s prece-\ndents and do not require a biological father’s consent to\nadoption unless he has provided financial support during\npregnancy. See Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246, 254–\n256 (1978); Lehr, 463 U. S., at 261. Other States, how-\never, have decided to give the rights of biological fathers\nmore robust protection and to afford them consent rights\non the basis of their biological link to the child. At the\ntime that ICWA was passed, as noted, over one-fourth of\nStates did so. See supra, at 17–18.\n   ICWA, on a straightforward reading of the statute, is\nconsistent with the law of those States that protected, and\nprotect, birth fathers’ rights more vigorously. This read­\ning can hardly be said to generate an anomaly. ICWA, as\nall acknowledge, was “the product of rising concern . . .\n[about] abusive child welfare practices that resulted in the\nseparation of large numbers of Indian children from their\nfamilies.” Holyfield, 490 U.

Ante, at 14, 16. This claim is the most perplex­\ning of all. A central purpose of ICWA is to “promote the\nstability and security of Indian . . . families,” 25 U. S. C.\n§1902, in part by countering the trend of placing “an\nalarmingly high percentage of [Indian] children . . . in non-\nIndian foster and adoptive homes and institutions.”\n§1901(4). The Act accomplishes this goal by, first, protect­\ning the familial bonds of Indian parents and children, see\nsupra, at 4–12; and, second, establishing placement pref­\nerences should an adoption take place, see §1915(a).\nICWA does not interfere with the adoption of Indian chil­\ndren except to the extent that it attempts to avert the\nnecessity of adoptive placement and makes adoptions of\nIndian children by non-Indian families less likely.\n  The majority may consider this scheme unwise.

Ante, at 9–10. We may not, however, give\neffect only to congressional goals we designate “primary”\nwhile casting aside others classed as “secondary”; we must\napply the entire statute Congress has written. While there\nare indications that central among Congress’ concerns\nin enacting ICWA was the removal of Indian children\nfrom homes in which Indian parents or other guardians\nhad custody of them, see, e.g., §§1901(4), 1902, Con-\ngress also recognized that “there is no resource that is\nmore vital to the continued existence and integrity of\nIndian tribes than their children,” §1901(3). As we ob­\nserved in Holyfield, ICWA protects not only Indian par­\nents’ interests but also those of Indian tribes. See 490\nU. S., at 34, 52. A tribe’s interest in its next generation of\ncitizens is adversely affected by the placement of Indian\nchildren in homes with no connection to the tribe, whether\nor not those children were initially in the custody of an\nIndian parent.15\n   Moreover, the majority’s focus on “intact” families, ante,\nat 10, begs the question of what Congress set out to ac­\ncomplish with ICWA.

In an ideal world\nparents would never become estranged and leave their\nchildren caught in the middle. But we do not live in\nsuch a world. Even happy families do not always fit the\ncustodial-parent mold for which the majority would reserve\nIWCA’s substantive protections; unhappy families all too\noften do not. They are families nonetheless. Congress\nunderstood as much. ICWA’s definitions of “parent” and\n“termination of parental rights” provided in §1903 sweep\nbroadly.

The majority’s repeated, analytically\nunnecessary references to the fact that Baby Girl is 3/256\nCherokee by ancestry do nothing to elucidate its intima­\ntion that the statute may violate the Equal Protection\nClause as applied here. See ante, at 1, 6; see also ante,\nat 16 (stating that ICWA “would put certain vulner-\nable children at a great disadvantage solely because an\nancestor—even a remote one—was an Indian” (emphasis\nadded)). I see no ground for this Court to second-guess the\nmembership requirements of federally recognized Indian\ntribes, which are independent political entities. See Santa\nClara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49, 72, n. 32 (1978).\nI am particularly averse to doing so when the Federal\nGovernment requires Indian tribes, as a prerequisite for\nofficial recognition, to make “descen[t] from a historical\nIndian tribe” a condition of membership. 25 CFR §83.7(e)\n(2012).\n   The majority’s treatment of this issue, in the end, does\nno more than create a lingering mood of disapprobation of\nthe criteria for membership adopted by the Cherokee\nNation that, in turn, make Baby Girl an “Indian child”\nunder the statute. Its hints at lurking constitutional\nproblems are, by its own account, irrelevant to its statutory\nanalysis, and accordingly need not detain us any longer.\n                           III\n  Because I would affirm the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt on the ground that §1912 bars the termination of\nBirth Father’s parental rights, I would not reach the\nquestion of the applicability of the adoptive placement\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           25\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npreferences of §1915. I note, however, that the majority\ndoes not and cannot foreclose the possibility that on re­\nmand, Baby Girl’s paternal grandparents or other mem­\nbers of the Cherokee Nation may formally petition for\nadoption of Baby Girl. If these parties do so, and if on\nremand Birth Father’s parental rights are terminated so\nthat an adoption becomes possible, they will then be enti­\ntled to consideration under the order of preference estab­\nlished in §1915. The majority cannot rule prospectively\nthat §1915 would not apply to an adoption petition that\nhas not yet been filed. Indeed, the statute applies “[i]n\nany adoptive placement of an Indian child under State\nlaw,” 25 U. S. C. §1915(a) (emphasis added), and contains\nno temporal qualifications. It would indeed be an odd\nresult for this Court, in the name of the child’s best in-\nterests, cf. ante, at 15, to purport to exclude from the pro­\nceedings possible custodians for Baby Girl, such as her\npaternal grandparents, who may have well-established\nrelationships with her.\n                         *    *    *\n   The majority opinion turns §1912 upside down, reading\nit from bottom to top in order to reach a conclusion that is\nmanifestly contrary to Congress’ express purpose in enact­\ning ICWA: preserving the familial bonds between Indian\nparents and their children and, more broadly, Indian\ntribes’ relationships with the future citizens who are “vital\nto [their] continued existence and integrity.” §1901(3).\n   The majority casts Birth Father as responsible for the\npainful circumstances in this case, suggesting that he\nintervened “at the eleventh hour to override the mother’s\ndecision and the child’s best interests,” ante, at 16. I have\nno wish to minimize the trauma of removing a 27-month­\nold child from her adoptive family. It bears remembering,\nhowever, that Birth Father took action to assert his paren­\ntal rights when Baby Girl was four months old, as soon as\n26            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhe learned of the impending adoption. As the South Caro­\nlina Supreme Court recognized, “ ‘[h]ad the mandate of . . .\nICWA been followed [in 2010], . . . much potential anguish\nmight have been avoided[;] and in any case the law cannot\nbe applied so as automatically to “reward those who obtain\ncustody, whether lawfully or otherwise, and maintain it\nduring any ensuing (and protracted) litigation.” ’ ” 398\nS. C., at 652, 731 S. E. 2d, at 564 (quoting Holyfield, 490\nU. S., at 53–54).\n   The majority’s hollow literalism distorts the statute and\nignores Congress’ purpose in order to rectify a perceived\nwrong that, while heartbreaking at the time, was a correct\napplication of federal law and that in any case cannot be\nundone. Baby Girl has now resided with her father for 18\nmonths. However difficult it must have been for her to\nleave Adoptive Couple’s home when she was just over 2\nyears old, it will be equally devastating now if, at the age\nof 3½, she is again removed from her home and sent to live\nhalfway across the country. Such a fate is not foreor­\ndained, of course. But it can be said with certainty that\nthe anguish this case has caused will only be compounded\nby today’s decision.\n   I believe that the South Carolina Supreme Court’s\njudgment was correct, and I would affirm it. I respectfully\ndissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/931616/", "sha1": "d7e2957c923f0b61ab3cde6991f7c549010e9842", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2012-075", "time_retrieved": "2013-06-25T17:01:45.286497"}
