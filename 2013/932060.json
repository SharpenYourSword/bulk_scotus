UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 12–357.      Argued April 23, 2013—Decided June 26, 2013\nInvestments for the employee pension fund of the State of New York\n  and its local governments are chosen by the fund’s sole trustee, the\n  State Comptroller. After the Comptroller’s general counsel recom-\n  mended against investing in a fund managed by FA Technology Ven-\n  tures, the general counsel received anonymous e-mails demanding\n  that he recommend the investment and threatening, if he did not, to\n  disclose information about the general counsel’s alleged affair to his\n  wife, government officials, and the media. Some of the e-mails were\n  traced to the home computer of petitioner Sekhar, a managing part-\n  ner of FA Technology Ventures. Petitioner was convicted of attempt-\n  ed extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U. S. C. §1951(a),\n  which defines “extortion” to mean “the obtaining of property from an-\n  other, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threat-\n  ened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right,”\n  §1951(b)(2). The jury specified that the property petitioner attempt-\n  ed to extort was the general counsel’s recommendation to approve the\n  investment. The Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Attempting to compel a person to recommend that his employer\n approve an investment does not constitute “the obtaining of property\n from another” under the Hobbs Act. Pp. 3–9.\n    (a) Absent other indication, “Congress intends to incorporate the\n well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.” Neder v.\n United States, 527 U. S. 1, 23. As far as is known, no case predating\n the Hobbs Act—English, federal, or state—ever identified conduct\n such as that charged here as extortionate. Extortion required the ob-\n taining of items of value, typically cash, from the victim. The Act’s\n text confirms that obtaining property requires “not only the depriva-\n2                     SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion but also the acquisition of property.” Scheidler v. National Or-\n    ganization for Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 393, 404. The property extort-\n    ed must therefore be transferable—that is, capable of passing from\n    one person to another, a defining feature lacking in the alleged prop-\n    erty here. The genesis of the Hobbs Act reinforces that conclusion.\n    Congress borrowed nearly verbatim the definition of extortion from a\n    1909 New York statute but did not copy the coercion provision of that\n    statute. And in 1946, the time of the borrowing, New York courts\n    had consistently held that the sort of interference with rights that oc-\n    curred here was coercion. Finally, this Court’s own precedent de-\n    mands reversal of petitioner’s convictions. See id., at 404–405.\n    Pp. 3–8.\n       (b) The Government’s defense of the theory of conviction is unper-\n    suasive. No fluent speaker of English would say that “petitioner ob-\n    tained and exercised the general counsel’s right to make a recom-\n    mendation,” any more than he would say that a person “obtained and\n    exercised another’s right to free speech.” He would say that “petition-\n    er forced the general counsel to make a particular recommendation,”\n    just as he would say that a person “forced another to make a state-\n    ment.” Adopting the Government’s theory here would not only make\n    nonsense of words; it would collapse the longstanding distinction be-\n    tween extortion and coercion and ignore Congress’s choice to penalize\n    one but not the other.

S. C. §1951(b)(2).\n                              I\n  New York’s Common Retirement Fund is an employee\npension fund for the State of New York and its local gov-\nernments. As sole trustee of the Fund, the State Comp-\ntroller chooses Fund investments. When the Comptroller\ndecides to approve an investment he issues a “Commit-\nment.” A Commitment, however, does not actually bind\nthe Fund. For that to happen, the Fund and the recipient\nof the investment must enter into a limited partnership\nagreement. 683 F. 3d 436, 438 (CA2 2012).\n  Petitioner Giridhar Sekhar was a managing partner of\nFA Technology Ventures. In October 2009, the Comptrol-\nler’s office was considering whether to invest in a fund\nmanaged by that firm. The office’s general counsel made a\nwritten recommendation to the Comptroller not to invest\nin the fund, after learning that the Office of the New York\n2                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAttorney General was investigating another fund man-\naged by the firm. The Comptroller decided not to issue a\nCommitment and notified a partner of FA Technology\nVentures. That partner had previously heard rumors that\nthe general counsel was having an extramarital affair.\n   The general counsel then received a series of anony-\nmous e-mails demanding that he recommend moving for-\nward with the investment and threatening, if he did not,\nto disclose information about his alleged affair to his wife,\ngovernment officials, and the media. App. 59–61. The\ngeneral counsel contacted law enforcement, which traced\nsome of the e-mails to petitioner’s home computer and\nother e-mails to offices of FA Technology Ventures.\n   Petitioner was indicted for, and a jury convicted him of,\nattempted extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18\nU. S. C. §1951(a). That Act subjects a person to criminal\nliability if he “in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or\naffects commerce or the movement of any article or com-\nmodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts\nor conspires so to do.” §1951(a). The Act defines “extor-\ntion” to mean “the obtaining of property from another,\nwith his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or\nthreatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official\nright.” §1951(b)(2).1 On the verdict form, the jury was\nasked to specify the property that petitioner attempted to\nextort: (1) “the Commitment”; (2) “the Comptroller’s ap-\nproval of the Commitment”; or (3) “the General Counsel’s\n\n——————\n   1 Petitioner was also convicted of several counts of interstate trans-\n\nmission of extortionate threats, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §875(d).\nUnder §875(d), a person is criminally liable if he, “with intent to extort\nfrom any person, firm, association, or corporation, any money or other\nthing of value, transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any com-\nmunication containing any threat to injure the property or reputation\nof the addressee.” In this case, both parties concede that the definition\nof “extortion” under the Hobbs Act also applies to the §875(d) counts.\nWe express no opinion on the validity of that concession.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrecommendation to approve the Commitment.” App. 141–\n142. The jury chose only the third option.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed\nthe conviction. The court held that the general counsel\n“had a property right in rendering sound legal advice to\nthe Comptroller and, specifically, to recommend—free from\nthreats—whether the Comptroller should issue a Com-\nmitment for [the funds].” 683 F. 3d, at 441. The court\nconcluded that petitioner not only attempted to deprive\nthe general counsel of his “property right,” but that peti-\ntioner also “attempted to exercise that right by forcing the\nGeneral Counsel to make a recommendation determined\nby [petitioner].” Id., at 442.\n   We granted certiorari. 568 U.

United States, 527 U. S. 1, 23 (1999).\n    “[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are\n    accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of cen-\n    turies of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the\n    cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed\n    word in the body of learning from which it was taken\n    and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial\n    mind unless otherwise instructed.” Morissette v.\n    United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952).\nOr as Justice Frankfurter colorfully put it, “if a word is\nobviously transplanted from another legal source, whether\n4                SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe common law or other legislation, it brings the old soil\nwith it.” Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47\nColum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947).\n   The Hobbs Act punishes “extortion,” one of the oldest\ncrimes in our legal tradition, see E. Coke, The Third Part\nof the Institutes of the Laws of England 148–150 (1648)\n(reprint 2008). The crime originally applied only to extor-\ntionate action by public officials, but was later extended\nby statute to private extortion. See 4 C. Torcia, Wharton’s\nCriminal Law §§695, 699 (14th ed. 1981). As far as is\nknown, no case predating the Hobbs Act—English, federal,\nor state—ever identified conduct such as that charged\nhere as extortionate. Extortion required the obtaining of\nitems of value, typically cash, from the victim. See, e.g.,\nPeople v.

Woodward, 11 Mod. 137, 88 Eng. Rep. 949\n(K. B. 1707) (upholding indictment for extorting “money\nand a note”). It did not cover mere coercion to act, or to\nrefrain from acting. See, e.g., King v. Burdett, 1 Ld. Raym.\n149, 91 Eng. Rep. 996 (K. B. 1696) (dictum) (extortion\nconsisted of the “taking of money for the use of the stalls,”\nnot the deprivation of “free liberty to sell [one’s] wares in\nthe market according to law”).\n   The text of the statute at issue confirms that the\nalleged property here cannot be extorted. Enacted in 1946,\nthe Hobbs Act defines its crime of “extortion” as “the ob-\ntaining of property from another, with his consent, induced\nby wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence,\nor fear, or under color of official right.” 18 U. S. C.\n§1951(b)(2) (emphasis added). Obtaining property re-\nquires “not only the deprivation but also the acquisition of\n                      Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nproperty.” Scheidler v. National Organization for Women,\nInc., 537 U. S. 393, 404 (2003) (citing United States v.\nEnmons, 410 U. S. 396, 400 (1973)). That is, it requires\nthat the victim “part with” his property, R. Perkins & R.\nBoyce, Criminal Law 451 (3d ed. 1982), and that the extor-\ntionist “gain possession” of it, Scheidler, supra, at 403,\nn. 8; see also Webster’s New International Dictionary 1682\n(2d ed. 1949) (defining “obtain”); Murray, Note, Protesters,\nExtortion, and Coercion: Preventing RICO from Chilling\nFirst Amendment Freedoms, 75 Notre Dame L. Rev. 691,\n706 (1999) (Murray). The property extorted must there-\nfore be transferable—that is, capable of passing from one\nperson to another. The alleged property here lacks that\ndefining feature.2\n   The genesis of the Hobbs Act reinforces that conclusion.\nThe Act was modeled after §850 of the New York Penal\nLaw (1909), which was derived from the famous Field\nCode, a 19th-century model penal code, see 4 Commission-\ners of the Code, Penal Code of the State of New York §613,\np. 220 (1865) (reprint 1998). Congress borrowed, nearly\nverbatim, the New York statute’s definition of extortion.\nSee Scheidler, 537 U. S., at 403. The New York statute\ncontained, in addition to the felony crime of extortion, a\nnew (that is to say, nonexistent at common law) misde-\nmeanor crime of coercion. Whereas the former required,\nas we have said, “ ‘the criminal acquisition of . . . property,’ ”\nibid., the latter required merely the use of threats “to\n——————\n  2 It may well be proper under the Hobbs Act for the Government to\n\ncharge a person who obtains money by threatening a third party, who\nobtains funds belonging to a corporate or governmental entity by\nthreatening the entity’s agent, see 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law §408, p.\n334, and n. 3 (9th ed. 1923) (citing State v. Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ind.</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1849)), or\nwho obtains “goodwill and customer revenues” by threatening a market\ncompetitor, see, e.g., United States v. Zemek, 634 F. 2d 1159, 1173 (CA9\n1980). Each of these might be considered “obtaining property from\nanother.” We need not consider those situations, however, because the\nGovernment did not charge any of them here.\n6                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncompel another person to do or to abstain from doing an\nact which such other such person has a legal right to do\nor to abstain from doing.” N. Y. Penal Law §530 (1909),\nearlier codified in N. Y. Penal Code §653 (1881). Congress\ndid not copy the coercion provision. The omission must\nhave been deliberate, since it was perfectly clear that\nextortion did not include coercion. At the time of the\nborrowing (1946), New York courts had consistently held\nthat the sort of interference with rights that occurred here\nwas coercion. See, e.g., People v. Ginsberg, 262 N. Y. 556,\n188 N. E. 62 (1933) (per curiam) (compelling store owner\nto become a member of a trade association and to remove\nadvertisements); People v. Scotti, 266 N. Y. 480, 195 N. E.\n162 (App. Div. 1934) (compelling victim to enter into\nagreement with union); People v. Kaplan, 240 App. Div.\n72, 74–75, 269 N. Y. S. 161, 163–164, aff ’d, 264 N. Y. 675,\n191 N. E. 621 (1934) (compelling union members to drop\nlawsuits against union leadership).3\n\n——————\n  3 Also revealing, the New York code prohibited conspiracy “[t]o pre-\n\nvent another from exercising a lawful trade or calling, or doing any\nother lawful act, by force, threats, intimidation.” N. Y. Penal Law\n§580(5) (1909) (emphasis added). That separate codification, which Con-\ngress did not adopt, is further evidence that the New York crime of\nextortion (and hence the federal crime) did not reach interference with\na person’s right to ply a lawful trade, similar to the right claimed here.\n   Seeking to extract something from the void, the Government relies\non cases that interpret a provision of the New York code defining\nthe kinds of threats that qualify as threats to do “unlawful injury to the\nperson or property,” which is what the extortion statute requires. See\nN. Y. Penal Code §553 (1881); N. Y. Penal Law §851 (1909). Those\ncases held that they include threats to injure a business by preventing\nthe return of workers from a strike, People v. Barondess, 133 N. Y. 649,\n31 N. E. 240, 241–242 (1892) (per curiam), and threats to terminate a\nperson’s employment, People ex rel. Short v. Warden, 145 App. Div. 861,\n130 N. Y. S. 698, 700–701 (1911), aff’d, 206 N. Y. 632, 99 N. E. 1116\n(1912) (per curiam). Those cases are entirely inapposite here, where\nthe issue is not what constitutes a qualifying threat but what consti-\ntutes obtainable property.\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   And finally, this Court’s own precedent similarly de-\nmands reversal of petitioner’s convictions. In Scheidler,\nwe held that protesters did not commit extortion under the\nHobbs Act, even though they “interfered with, disrupted,\nand in some instances completely deprived” abortion\nclinics of their ability to run their business. 537 U. S., at\n404–405. We reasoned that the protesters may have\ndeprived the clinics of an “alleged property right,” but they\ndid not pursue or receive “ ‘something of value from’ ” the\nclinics that they could then “exercise, transfer, or sell”\nthemselves. Id., at 405. The opinion supported its holding\nby citing the three New York coercion cases discussed\nabove. See id., at 405–406.\n   This case is easier than Scheidler, where one might at\nleast have said that physical occupation of property\namounted to obtaining that property. The deprivation\nalleged here is far more abstract. Scheidler rested its\ndecision, as we do, on the term “obtaining.” Id., at 402,\nn. 6. The principle announced there—that a defendant\nmust pursue something of value from the victim that can\nbe exercised, transferred, or sold—applies with equal force\nhere.4 Whether one considers the personal right at issue\n\n——————\n  4 The  Government’s attempt to distinguish Scheidler is unconvinc-\ning. In its view, had the protesters sought to force the clinics to pro-\nvide services other than abortion, extortion would have been a proper\ncharge. Petitioner committed extortion here, the Government says,\nbecause he did not merely attempt to prevent the general counsel from\ngiving a recommendation but tried instead to force him to issue one.\nThat distinction is, not to put too fine a point on it, nonsensical. It is\ncoercion, not extortion, when a person is forced to do something and\nwhen he is forced to do nothing. See, e.g., N. Y. Penal Law §530 (1909)\n(it is a misdemeanor to coerce a “person to do or to abstain from doing\nan act”). Congress’s enactment of the Hobbs Act did not, through the\nphrase “obtaining of property from another,” suddenly transform every\nact that coerces affirmative conduct into a crime punishable for up to 20\nyears, while leaving those who “merely” coerce inaction immune from\nfederal punishment.\n8                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto be “property” in a broad sense or not, it certainly was\nnot obtainable property under the Hobbs Act.5\n                               B\n   The Government’s shifting and imprecise characteriza-\ntion of the alleged property at issue betrays the weakness\nof its case. According to the jury’s verdict form, the “prop-\nerty” that petitioner attempted to extort was “the General\nCounsel’s recommendation to approve the Commitment.”\nApp. 142. But the Government expends minuscule effort\nin defending that theory of conviction. And for good\nreason—to wit, our decision in Cleveland v. United States,\n531 U. S. 12 (2000), which reversed a business owner’s\nmail-fraud conviction for “obtaining money or property”\nthrough misrepresentations made in an application for a\nvideo-poker license issued by the State. We held that\na “license” is not “property” while in the State’s hands and\nso cannot be “obtained” from the State. Id., at 20–22.\nEven less so can an employee’s yet-to-be-issued recom-\nmendation be called obtainable property, and less so still\na yet-to-be-issued recommendation that would merely ap-\nprove (but not effect) a particular investment.\n   Hence the Government’s reliance on an alternative,\nmore sophisticated (and sophistic) description of the\nproperty. Instead of defending the jury’s description, the Gov-\nernment hinges its case on the general counsel’s “intangi-\nble property right to give his disinterested legal opinion to\n——————\n   5 The concurrence contends that the “right to make [a] recommenda-\n\ntion” is not property. Post, at 4 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). We\nare not sure of that. If one defines property to include anything of\nvalue, surely some rights to make recommendations would qualify—for\nexample, a member of the Pulitzer Prize Committee’s right to recom-\nmend the recipient of the prize. I suppose that a prominent journalist\nwould not give up that right (he cannot, of course, transfer it) for a\nsignificant sum of money—so it must be valuable. But the point\nrelevant to the present case is that it cannot be transferred, so it cannot\nbe the object of extortion under the statute.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Or perhaps, a right to give the general coun-\nsel’s disinterested legal opinion to the general counsel’s\nclient?\n   Either formulation sounds absurd, because it is. Clearly,\npetitioner’s goal was not to acquire the general coun-\nsel’s “intangible property right to give disinterested legal\nadvice.” It was to force the general counsel to offer advice\nthat accorded with petitioner’s wishes. But again, that is\ncoercion, not extortion. See Murray 721–722. No fluent\nspeaker of English would say that “petitioner obtained\nand exercised the general counsel’s right to make a rec-\nommendation,” any more than he would say that a person\n“obtained and exercised another’s right to free speech.” He\nwould say that “petitioner forced the general counsel to\nmake a particular recommendation,” just as he would\nsay that a person “forced another to make a statement.”\nAdopting the Government’s theory here would not only\nmake nonsense of words; it would collapse the longstand-\ning distinction between extortion and coercion and ignore\nCongress’s choice to penalize one but not the other.

S. C. §1951. In my view,\nthey are not.\n                             I\n   The jury in this case returned a special verdict form\nand stated that the property that petitioner attempted\nto extort was “the General Counsel’s recommendation to\napprove the Commitment.” What the jury obviously\nmeant by this was the general counsel’s internal sugges-\ntion to his superior that the state government issue a\nnonbinding commitment to invest in a fund managed by\nFA Technology Ventures. We must therefore decide\nwhether this nonbinding internal recommendation by a\nsalaried state employee constitutes “property” within the\nmeaning of the Hobbs Act, which defines “extortion” as\n“the obtaining of property from another, with his con-\nsent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened\nforce, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.”\n§1951(b)(2).\n2                SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   The Hobbs Act does not define the term “property,” but\neven at common law the offense of extortion was under-\nstood to include the obtaining of any thing of value. 2 E.\nCoke, The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of\nEngland 368b (18th English ed. 1823) (“Extortion . . . is a\ngreat misprison, by wresting or unlawfully taking by any\nofficer, by colour of his office, any money or valuable thing\nof or from any man”); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\n*141 (extortion is “an abuse of public, justice which con-\nsists in any officer’s unlawfully taking, by colour of his\noffice, from any man, any money or thing of value”). See\nalso 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law §401, pp. 331–332 (9th ed.\n1923) (“In most cases, the thing obtained is money. . . . But\nprobably anything of value will suffice”); 3 F. Wharton, A\nTreatise on Criminal Law §1898, p. 2095 (11th ed. 1912)\n(“[I]t is enough if any valuable thing is received”).\n   At the time Congress enacted the Hobbs Act, the con-\ntemporary edition of Black’s Law Dictionary included an\nexpansive definition of the term. See Black’s Law Diction-\nary 1446 (3d ed. 1933). It stated that “[t]he term is said to\nextend to every species of valuable right and interest. . . .\nThe word is also commonly used to denote everything\nwhich is the subject of ownership, corporeal or incorporeal,\ntangible or intangible, visible or invisible, real or personal;\neverything that has an exchangeable value or which goes\nto make up wealth or estate.” Id., at 1446–1447. And the\nlower courts have long given the term a similarly expan-\nsive construction. See, e.g., United States v. Tropiano,\n418 F. 2d 1069, 1075 (CA2 1969) (“The concept of prop-\nerty under the Hobbs Act . . . includes, in a broad sense,\nany valuable right considered as a source or element of\nwealth”).\n   Despite the breadth of some of these formulations,\nhowever, the term “property” plainly does not reach every-\nthing that a person may hold dear; nor does it extend to\neverything that might in some indirect way portend the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\npossibility of future economic gain. I do not suggest that\nthe current lower court case law is necessarily correct, but\nit seems clear that the case now before us is an outlier and\nthat the jury’s verdict stretches the concept of property\nbeyond the breaking point.\n   It is not customary to refer to an internal recommenda-\ntion to make a government decision as a form of property.\nIt would seem strange to say that the government or its\nemployees have a property interest in their internal rec-\nommendations regarding such things as the issuance of\na building permit, the content of an environmental impact\nstatement, the approval of a new drug, or the indictment\nof an individual or a corporation. And it would be even\nstranger to say that a private party who might be affected\nby the government’s decision can obtain a property inter-\nest in a recommendation to make the decision. See, e.g.,\nDoyle v. University of Alabama, 680 F. 2d 1323, 1326\n(CA11 1982) (“Doyle had no protected property interest\nin the mere recommendation for a raise; thus she was not\nentitled to due process safeguards when the recommended\nraise was disapproved by the University”).\n   Our decision in Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12\n(2000), supports the conclusion that internal recommenda-\ntions regarding government decisions are not property. In\nCleveland, we vacated a business owner’s conviction under\nthe federal mail fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. §1341, for “ob-\ntaining money or property” through misrepresentations\nmade in an application for a video poker license issued by\nthe State. We held that a video poker license is not prop-\nerty in the hands of the State. Cleveland, supra, at 15. I\ndo not suggest that the concepts of property under the\nmail fraud statute and the Hobbs Act are necessarily the\nsame. But surely a video poker license has a stronger\nclaim to be classified as property than a mere internal\nrecommendation that a state government take an initial\nstep that might lead eventually to an investment that\n4                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwould be beneficial to private parties.\n   The Government has not cited any Hobbs Act case\nholding that an internal recommendation regarding a gov-\nernment decision constitutes property. Nor has the Gov-\nernment cited any other example of the use of the term\n“property” in this sense.*\n   The Second Circuit recharacterized the property that\npetitioner attempted to obtain as the general counsel’s\n“right to make a recommendation consistent with his legal\njudgment.” 683 F. 3d 436, 442 (2012). And the Govern-\nment also presses that theory in this Court. Brief for\nUnited States 15, 34–45. According to the Government,\nthe general counsel’s property interest in his recommenda-\ntion encompasses the right to make the recommendation.\nId., at 35–36. But this argument assumes that the rec-\nommendation itself is property. See id., at 35 (the general\ncounsel’s “ ‘recommendation’ and his ‘right to make the\nrecommendation’ are merely different expressions of the\nsame property”). If an internal recommendation regarding\na government decision does not constitute property, then\nsurely a government employee’s right to make such a\nrecommendation is not property either (nor could it be\ndeemed a property right).\n                           II\n  The Government argues that the recommendation was\nthe general counsel’s personal property because it was\n——————\n   * To recognize that an internal recommendation regarding a govern-\nment decision is not property does not foreclose the possibility that\nthreatening a government employee, as the government’s agent, in\norder to secure government property could qualify as Hobbs Act extor-\ntion. Here, after all, petitioner’s ultimate goal was to secure an invest-\nment of money from the government. But the jury found only that\npetitioner had attempted to obtain the general counsel’s recommenda-\ntion, so I have no occasion to consider whether a Hobbs Act conviction\ncould have been sustained on a different legal theory.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

But that argument is\nclearly wrong: If the general counsel had left the State’s\nemploy before submitting the recommendation, he could\nnot have taken the recommendation with him, and he\ncertainly could not have given it or sold it to someone else.\nTherefore, it is obvious that the recommendation (and the\nright to make it) were inextricably related to the general\ncounsel’s position with the government, and not to his\nbroader personal right to pursue the practice of law.\n   The general counsel’s job surely had economic value to\nhim, as did his labor as a lawyer, his law license, and his\nreputation as an attorney. But the indictment did not\nallege, and the jury did not find, that petitioner attempted\nto obtain those things. Nor would such a theory make\nsense in the context of this case. Petitioner did not, for\nexample, seek the general counsel’s legal advice or de-\nmand that the general counsel represent him in a legal\nproceeding. Cf. United States v. Thompson, 647 F. 3d 180,\n186–187 (CA5 2011) (a person’s labor is property capable\nof being extorted). Nor did petitioner attempt to enhance\nhis own ability to compete with the general counsel for\nlegal work by threatening to do something that would, say,\ntarnish the general counsel’s reputation or cause his law\nlicense to be revoked. Cf. Tropiano, 418 F. 2d, at 1071–\n1072, 1075–1077 (threats to competitor in order to obtain\ncustomers constitute extortion); United States v. Zemek,\n634 F. 2d 1159, 1173–1174 (CA9 1980) (same); United\nStates v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndo not believe that the item in question constitutes prop-\nerty, it is unnecessary for me to determine whether or not\npetitioner sought to obtain it.\n                         *      *   *\n  If Congress had wanted to classify internal recommen-\ndations pertaining to government decisions as property,\nI think it would have spoken more clearly than it did in\nthe Hobbs Act.

National Organization for Women, Inc.,\n537 U. S. 393, 409 (2003). This is not to say that the\nGovernment could not have prosecuted petitioner for ex-\ntortion on these same facts under some other theory.\nThe question before us is whether the general counsel’s\nrecommendation—or the right to make it—constitutes\nproperty under the Hobbs Act. In my view, they do not.\n  For these reasons, I concur in the Court’s judgment.\n</pre>", "id": 932060, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/06/26/sekhar_v._united_states.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2012                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued April 23, 2013—Decided June 26, 2013\nInvestments for the employee pension fund of the State of New York\n  and its local governments are chosen by the fund’s sole trustee, the\n  State Comptroller. After the Comptroller’s general counsel recom-\n  mended against investing in a fund managed by FA Technology Ven-\n  tures, the general counsel received anonymous e-mails demanding\n  that he recommend the investment and threatening, if he did not, to\n  disclose information about the general counsel’s alleged affair to his\n  wife, government officials, and the media. Some of the e-mails were\n  traced to the home computer of petitioner Sekhar, a managing part-\n  ner of FA Technology Ventures. Petitioner was convicted of attempt-\n  ed extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U. S. C. §1951(a),\n  which defines “extortion” to mean “the obtaining of property from an-\n  other, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threat-\n  ened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right,”\n  §1951(b)(2). The jury specified that the property petitioner attempt-\n  ed to extort was the general counsel’s recommendation to approve the\n  investment. The Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Attempting to compel a person to recommend that his employer\n approve an investment does not constitute “the obtaining of property\n from another” under the Hobbs Act. Pp. 3–9.\n    (a) Absent other indication, “Congress intends to incorporate the\n well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.” Neder v.\n United States, 527 U. S. 1, 23. As far as is known, no case predating\n the Hobbs Act—English, federal, or state—ever identified conduct\n such as that charged here as extortionate. Extortion required the ob-\n taining of items of value, typically cash, from the victim. The Act’s\n text confirms that obtaining property requires “not only the depriva-\n2                     SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion but also the acquisition of property.” Scheidler v. National Or-\n    ganization for Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 393, 404. The property extort-\n    ed must therefore be transferable—that is, capable of passing from\n    one person to another, a defining feature lacking in the alleged prop-\n    erty here. The genesis of the Hobbs Act reinforces that conclusion.\n    Congress borrowed nearly verbatim the definition of extortion from a\n    1909 New York statute but did not copy the coercion provision of that\n    statute. And in 1946, the time of the borrowing, New York courts\n    had consistently held that the sort of interference with rights that oc-\n    curred here was coercion. Finally, this Court’s own precedent de-\n    mands reversal of petitioner’s convictions. See id., at 404–405.\n    Pp. 3–8.\n       (b) The Government’s defense of the theory of conviction is unper-\n    suasive. No fluent speaker of English would say that “petitioner ob-\n    tained and exercised the general counsel’s right to make a recom-\n    mendation,” any more than he would say that a person “obtained and\n    exercised another’s right to free speech.” He would say that “petition-\n    er forced the general counsel to make a particular recommendation,”\n    just as he would say that a person “forced another to make a state-\n    ment.” Adopting the Government’s theory here would not only make\n    nonsense of words; it would collapse the longstanding distinction be-\n    tween extortion and coercion and ignore Congress’s choice to penalize\n    one but not the other.

S. C. §1951(b)(2).\n                              I\n  New York’s Common Retirement Fund is an employee\npension fund for the State of New York and its local gov-\nernments. As sole trustee of the Fund, the State Comp-\ntroller chooses Fund investments. When the Comptroller\ndecides to approve an investment he issues a “Commit-\nment.” A Commitment, however, does not actually bind\nthe Fund. For that to happen, the Fund and the recipient\nof the investment must enter into a limited partnership\nagreement. 683 F. 3d 436, 438 (CA2 2012).\n  Petitioner Giridhar Sekhar was a managing partner of\nFA Technology Ventures. In October 2009, the Comptrol-\nler’s office was considering whether to invest in a fund\nmanaged by that firm. The office’s general counsel made a\nwritten recommendation to the Comptroller not to invest\nin the fund, after learning that the Office of the New York\n2                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAttorney General was investigating another fund man-\naged by the firm. The Comptroller decided not to issue a\nCommitment and notified a partner of FA Technology\nVentures. That partner had previously heard rumors that\nthe general counsel was having an extramarital affair.\n   The general counsel then received a series of anony-\nmous e-mails demanding that he recommend moving for-\nward with the investment and threatening, if he did not,\nto disclose information about his alleged affair to his wife,\ngovernment officials, and the media. App. 59–61. The\ngeneral counsel contacted law enforcement, which traced\nsome of the e-mails to petitioner’s home computer and\nother e-mails to offices of FA Technology Ventures.\n   Petitioner was indicted for, and a jury convicted him of,\nattempted extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18\nU. S. C. §1951(a). That Act subjects a person to criminal\nliability if he “in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or\naffects commerce or the movement of any article or com-\nmodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts\nor conspires so to do.” §1951(a). The Act defines “extor-\ntion” to mean “the obtaining of property from another,\nwith his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or\nthreatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official\nright.” §1951(b)(2).1 On the verdict form, the jury was\nasked to specify the property that petitioner attempted to\nextort: (1) “the Commitment”; (2) “the Comptroller’s ap-\nproval of the Commitment”; or (3) “the General Counsel’s\n\n——————\n   1 Petitioner was also convicted of several counts of interstate trans-\n\nmission of extortionate threats, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §875(d).\nUnder §875(d), a person is criminally liable if he, “with intent to extort\nfrom any person, firm, association, or corporation, any money or other\nthing of value, transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any com-\nmunication containing any threat to injure the property or reputation\nof the addressee.” In this case, both parties concede that the definition\nof “extortion” under the Hobbs Act also applies to the §875(d) counts.\nWe express no opinion on the validity of that concession.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

The jury chose only the third option.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed\nthe conviction. The court held that the general counsel\n“had a property right in rendering sound legal advice to\nthe Comptroller and, specifically, to recommend—free from\nthreats—whether the Comptroller should issue a Com-\nmitment for [the funds].” 683 F. 3d, at 441. The court\nconcluded that petitioner not only attempted to deprive\nthe general counsel of his “property right,” but that peti-\ntioner also “attempted to exercise that right by forcing the\nGeneral Counsel to make a recommendation determined\nby [petitioner].” Id., at 442.\n   We granted certiorari. 568 U.

United States, 527 U. S. 1, 23 (1999).\n    “[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are\n    accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of cen-\n    turies of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the\n    cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed\n    word in the body of learning from which it was taken\n    and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial\n    mind unless otherwise instructed.” Morissette v.\n    United States, 342 U.

Rev. 527, 537 (1947).\n   The Hobbs Act punishes “extortion,” one of the oldest\ncrimes in our legal tradition, see E. Coke, The Third Part\nof the Institutes of the Laws of England 148–150 (1648)\n(reprint 2008). The crime originally applied only to extor-\ntionate action by public officials, but was later extended\nby statute to private extortion. See 4 C. Torcia, Wharton’s\nCriminal Law §§695, 699 (14th ed. 1981). As far as is\nknown, no case predating the Hobbs Act—English, federal,\nor state—ever identified conduct such as that charged\nhere as extortionate. Extortion required the obtaining of\nitems of value, typically cash, from the victim. See, e.g.,\nPeople v. Whaley, 6 Cow. 661 (N. Y. Sup.

Enacted in 1946,\nthe Hobbs Act defines its crime of “extortion” as “the ob-\ntaining of property from another, with his consent, induced\nby wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence,\nor fear, or under color of official right.” 18 U.

S. 393, 404 (2003) (citing United States v.\nEnmons, 410 U. S. 396, 400 (1973)). That is, it requires\nthat the victim “part with” his property, R. Perkins & R.\nBoyce, Criminal Law 451 (3d ed. 1982), and that the extor-\ntionist “gain possession” of it, Scheidler, supra, at 403,\nn. 8; see also Webster’s New International Dictionary 1682\n(2d ed. 1949) (defining “obtain”); Murray, Note, Protesters,\nExtortion, and Coercion: Preventing RICO from Chilling\nFirst Amendment Freedoms, 75 Notre Dame L. Rev. 691,\n706 (1999) (Murray). The property extorted must there-\nfore be transferable—that is, capable of passing from one\nperson to another. The alleged property here lacks that\ndefining feature.2\n   The genesis of the Hobbs Act reinforces that conclusion.\nThe Act was modeled after §850 of the New York Penal\nLaw (1909), which was derived from the famous Field\nCode, a 19th-century model penal code, see 4 Commission-\ners of the Code, Penal Code of the State of New York §613,\np. 220 (1865) (reprint 1998). Congress borrowed, nearly\nverbatim, the New York statute’s definition of extortion.\nSee Scheidler, 537 U. S., at 403. The New York statute\ncontained, in addition to the felony crime of extortion, a\nnew (that is to say, nonexistent at common law) misde-\nmeanor crime of coercion. Whereas the former required,\nas we have said, “ ‘the criminal acquisition of . . . property,’ ”\nibid., the latter required merely the use of threats “to\n——————\n  2 It may well be proper under the Hobbs Act for the Government to\n\ncharge a person who obtains money by threatening a third party, who\nobtains funds belonging to a corporate or governmental entity by\nthreatening the entity’s agent, see 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law §408, p.\n334, and n. 3 (9th ed. 1923) (citing State v. Moore, 1 Ind. 548 (1849)), or\nwho obtains “goodwill and customer revenues” by threatening a market\ncompetitor, see, e.g., United States v. Zemek, 634 F. 2d 1159, 1173 (CA9\n1980). Each of these might be considered “obtaining property from\nanother.” We need not consider those situations, however, because the\nGovernment did not charge any of them here.\n6                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncompel another person to do or to abstain from doing an\nact which such other such person has a legal right to do\nor to abstain from doing.” N. Y. Penal Law §530 (1909),\nearlier codified in N. Y. Penal Code §653 (1881). Congress\ndid not copy the coercion provision. The omission must\nhave been deliberate, since it was perfectly clear that\nextortion did not include coercion. At the time of the\nborrowing (1946), New York courts had consistently held\nthat the sort of interference with rights that occurred here\nwas coercion. See, e.g., People v. Ginsberg, 262 N. Y. 556,\n188 N. E. 62 (1933) (per curiam) (compelling store owner\nto become a member of a trade association and to remove\nadvertisements); People v. Scotti, 266 N. Y. 480, 195 N. E.\n162 (App. Div. 1934) (compelling victim to enter into\nagreement with union); People v. Kaplan, 240 App. Div.\n72, 74–75, 269 N. Y. S. 161, 163–164, aff ’d, 264 N. Y. 675,\n191 N. E. 621 (1934) (compelling union members to drop\nlawsuits against union leadership).3\n\n——————\n  3 Also revealing, the New York code prohibited conspiracy “[t]o pre-\n\nvent another from exercising a lawful trade or calling, or doing any\nother lawful act, by force, threats, intimidation.” N. Y. Penal Law\n§580(5) (1909) (emphasis added). That separate codification, which Con-\ngress did not adopt, is further evidence that the New York crime of\nextortion (and hence the federal crime) did not reach interference with\na person’s right to ply a lawful trade, similar to the right claimed here.\n   Seeking to extract something from the void, the Government relies\non cases that interpret a provision of the New York code defining\nthe kinds of threats that qualify as threats to do “unlawful injury to the\nperson or property,” which is what the extortion statute requires. See\nN. Y. Penal Code §553 (1881); N. Y. Penal Law §851 (1909). Those\ncases held that they include threats to injure a business by preventing\nthe return of workers from a strike, People v. Barondess, 133 N. Y. 649,\n31 N. E. 240, 241–242 (1892) (per curiam), and threats to terminate a\nperson’s employment, People ex rel. Short v. Warden, 145 App. Div. 861,\n130 N. Y. S. 698, 700–701 (1911), aff’d, 206 N. Y. 632, 99 N. E. 1116\n(1912) (per curiam). Those cases are entirely inapposite here, where\nthe issue is not what constitutes a qualifying threat but what consti-\ntutes obtainable property.\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   And finally, this Court’s own precedent similarly de-\nmands reversal of petitioner’s convictions. In Scheidler,\nwe held that protesters did not commit extortion under the\nHobbs Act, even though they “interfered with, disrupted,\nand in some instances completely deprived” abortion\nclinics of their ability to run their business. 537 U. S., at\n404–405. We reasoned that the protesters may have\ndeprived the clinics of an “alleged property right,” but they\ndid not pursue or receive “ ‘something of value from’ ” the\nclinics that they could then “exercise, transfer, or sell”\nthemselves. Id., at 405. The opinion supported its holding\nby citing the three New York coercion cases discussed\nabove. See id., at 405–406.\n   This case is easier than Scheidler, where one might at\nleast have said that physical occupation of property\namounted to obtaining that property. The deprivation\nalleged here is far more abstract. Scheidler rested its\ndecision, as we do, on the term “obtaining.” Id., at 402,\nn. 6. The principle announced there—that a defendant\nmust pursue something of value from the victim that can\nbe exercised, transferred, or sold—applies with equal force\nhere.4 Whether one considers the personal right at issue\n\n——————\n  4 The  Government’s attempt to distinguish Scheidler is unconvinc-\ning. In its view, had the protesters sought to force the clinics to pro-\nvide services other than abortion, extortion would have been a proper\ncharge. Petitioner committed extortion here, the Government says,\nbecause he did not merely attempt to prevent the general counsel from\ngiving a recommendation but tried instead to force him to issue one.\nThat distinction is, not to put too fine a point on it, nonsensical. It is\ncoercion, not extortion, when a person is forced to do something and\nwhen he is forced to do nothing. See, e.g., N. Y. Penal Law §530 (1909)\n(it is a misdemeanor to coerce a “person to do or to abstain from doing\nan act”). Congress’s enactment of the Hobbs Act did not, through the\nphrase “obtaining of property from another,” suddenly transform every\nact that coerces affirmative conduct into a crime punishable for up to 20\nyears, while leaving those who “merely” coerce inaction immune from\nfederal punishment.\n8                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto be “property” in a broad sense or not, it certainly was\nnot obtainable property under the Hobbs Act.5\n                               B\n   The Government’s shifting and imprecise characteriza-\ntion of the alleged property at issue betrays the weakness\nof its case. According to the jury’s verdict form, the “prop-\nerty” that petitioner attempted to extort was “the General\nCounsel’s recommendation to approve the Commitment.”\nApp. 142. But the Government expends minuscule effort\nin defending that theory of conviction. And for good\nreason—to wit, our decision in Cleveland v. United States,\n531 U. S. 12 (2000), which reversed a business owner’s\nmail-fraud conviction for “obtaining money or property”\nthrough misrepresentations made in an application for a\nvideo-poker license issued by the State. We held that\na “license” is not “property” while in the State’s hands and\nso cannot be “obtained” from the State. Id., at 20–22.\nEven less so can an employee’s yet-to-be-issued recom-\nmendation be called obtainable property, and less so still\na yet-to-be-issued recommendation that would merely ap-\nprove (but not effect) a particular investment.\n   Hence the Government’s reliance on an alternative,\nmore sophisticated (and sophistic) description of the\nproperty. Instead of defending the jury’s description, the Gov-\nernment hinges its case on the general counsel’s “intangi-\nble property right to give his disinterested legal opinion to\n——————\n   5 The concurrence contends that the “right to make [a] recommenda-\n\ntion” is not property. Post, at 4 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). We\nare not sure of that. If one defines property to include anything of\nvalue, surely some rights to make recommendations would qualify—for\nexample, a member of the Pulitzer Prize Committee’s right to recom-\nmend the recipient of the prize. I suppose that a prominent journalist\nwould not give up that right (he cannot, of course, transfer it) for a\nsignificant sum of money—so it must be valuable. But the point\nrelevant to the present case is that it cannot be transferred, so it cannot\nbe the object of extortion under the statute.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhis client free of improper outside interference.” Brief for\nUnited States 39. But what, exactly, would the petitioner\nhave obtained for himself? A right to give his own disin-\nterested legal opinion to his own client free of improper\ninterference? Or perhaps, a right to give the general coun-\nsel’s disinterested legal opinion to the general counsel’s\nclient?\n   Either formulation sounds absurd, because it is. Clearly,\npetitioner’s goal was not to acquire the general coun-\nsel’s “intangible property right to give disinterested legal\nadvice.” It was to force the general counsel to offer advice\nthat accorded with petitioner’s wishes. But again, that is\ncoercion, not extortion. See Murray 721–722. No fluent\nspeaker of English would say that “petitioner obtained\nand exercised the general counsel’s right to make a rec-\nommendation,” any more than he would say that a person\n“obtained and exercised another’s right to free speech.” He\nwould say that “petitioner forced the general counsel to\nmake a particular recommendation,” just as he would\nsay that a person “forced another to make a statement.”\nAdopting the Government’s theory here would not only\nmake nonsense of words; it would collapse the longstand-\ning distinction between extortion and coercion and ignore\nCongress’s choice to penalize one but not the other.

S. C. §1951. In my view,\nthey are not.\n                             I\n   The jury in this case returned a special verdict form\nand stated that the property that petitioner attempted\nto extort was “the General Counsel’s recommendation to\napprove the Commitment.” What the jury obviously\nmeant by this was the general counsel’s internal sugges-\ntion to his superior that the state government issue a\nnonbinding commitment to invest in a fund managed by\nFA Technology Ventures. We must therefore decide\nwhether this nonbinding internal recommendation by a\nsalaried state employee constitutes “property” within the\nmeaning of the Hobbs Act, which defines “extortion” as\n“the obtaining of property from another, with his con-\nsent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened\nforce, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.”\n§1951(b)(2).\n2                SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   The Hobbs Act does not define the term “property,” but\neven at common law the offense of extortion was under-\nstood to include the obtaining of any thing of value. 2 E.\nCoke, The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of\nEngland 368b (18th English ed. 1823) (“Extortion . . . is a\ngreat misprison, by wresting or unlawfully taking by any\nofficer, by colour of his office, any money or valuable thing\nof or from any man”); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\n*141 (extortion is “an abuse of public, justice which con-\nsists in any officer’s unlawfully taking, by colour of his\noffice, from any man, any money or thing of value”). See\nalso 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law §401, pp. 331–332 (9th ed.\n1923) (“In most cases, the thing obtained is money. . . . But\nprobably anything of value will suffice”); 3 F. Wharton, A\nTreatise on Criminal Law §1898, p. 2095 (11th ed. 1912)\n(“[I]t is enough if any valuable thing is received”).\n   At the time Congress enacted the Hobbs Act, the con-\ntemporary edition of Black’s Law Dictionary included an\nexpansive definition of the term. See Black’s Law Diction-\nary 1446 (3d ed. 1933). It stated that “[t]he term is said to\nextend to every species of valuable right and interest. . . .\nThe word is also commonly used to denote everything\nwhich is the subject of ownership, corporeal or incorporeal,\ntangible or intangible, visible or invisible, real or personal;\neverything that has an exchangeable value or which goes\nto make up wealth or estate.” Id., at 1446–1447. And the\nlower courts have long given the term a similarly expan-\nsive construction. See, e.g., United States v. Tropiano,\n418 F. 2d 1069, 1075 (CA2 1969) (“The concept of prop-\nerty under the Hobbs Act . . . includes, in a broad sense,\nany valuable right considered as a source or element of\nwealth”).\n   Despite the breadth of some of these formulations,\nhowever, the term “property” plainly does not reach every-\nthing that a person may hold dear; nor does it extend to\neverything that might in some indirect way portend the\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

I do not suggest that\nthe current lower court case law is necessarily correct, but\nit seems clear that the case now before us is an outlier and\nthat the jury’s verdict stretches the concept of property\nbeyond the breaking point.\n   It is not customary to refer to an internal recommenda-\ntion to make a government decision as a form of property.\nIt would seem strange to say that the government or its\nemployees have a property interest in their internal rec-\nommendations regarding such things as the issuance of\na building permit, the content of an environmental impact\nstatement, the approval of a new drug, or the indictment\nof an individual or a corporation. And it would be even\nstranger to say that a private party who might be affected\nby the government’s decision can obtain a property inter-\nest in a recommendation to make the decision. See, e.g.,\nDoyle v. University of Alabama, 680 F. 2d 1323, 1326\n(CA11 1982) (“Doyle had no protected property interest\nin the mere recommendation for a raise; thus she was not\nentitled to due process safeguards when the recommended\nraise was disapproved by the University”).\n   Our decision in Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12\n(2000), supports the conclusion that internal recommenda-\ntions regarding government decisions are not property. In\nCleveland, we vacated a business owner’s conviction under\nthe federal mail fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. §1341, for “ob-\ntaining money or property” through misrepresentations\nmade in an application for a video poker license issued by\nthe State. We held that a video poker license is not prop-\nerty in the hands of the State. Cleveland, supra, at 15. I\ndo not suggest that the concepts of property under the\nmail fraud statute and the Hobbs Act are necessarily the\nsame. But surely a video poker license has a stronger\nclaim to be classified as property than a mere internal\nrecommendation that a state government take an initial\nstep that might lead eventually to an investment that\n4                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwould be beneficial to private parties.\n   The Government has not cited any Hobbs Act case\nholding that an internal recommendation regarding a gov-\nernment decision constitutes property. Nor has the Gov-\nernment cited any other example of the use of the term\n“property” in this sense.*\n   The Second Circuit recharacterized the property that\npetitioner attempted to obtain as the general counsel’s\n“right to make a recommendation consistent with his legal\njudgment.” 683 F. 3d 436, 442 (2012). And the Govern-\nment also presses that theory in this Court. Brief for\nUnited States 15, 34–45. According to the Government,\nthe general counsel’s property interest in his recommenda-\ntion encompasses the right to make the recommendation.\nId., at 35–36. But this argument assumes that the rec-\nommendation itself is property. See id., at 35 (the general\ncounsel’s “ ‘recommendation’ and his ‘right to make the\nrecommendation’ are merely different expressions of the\nsame property”). If an internal recommendation regarding\na government decision does not constitute property, then\nsurely a government employee’s right to make such a\nrecommendation is not property either (nor could it be\ndeemed a property right).\n                           II\n  The Government argues that the recommendation was\nthe general counsel’s personal property because it was\n——————\n   * To recognize that an internal recommendation regarding a govern-\nment decision is not property does not foreclose the possibility that\nthreatening a government employee, as the government’s agent, in\norder to secure government property could qualify as Hobbs Act extor-\ntion. Here, after all, petitioner’s ultimate goal was to secure an invest-\nment of money from the government. But the jury found only that\npetitioner had attempted to obtain the general counsel’s recommenda-\ntion, so I have no occasion to consider whether a Hobbs Act conviction\ncould have been sustained on a different legal theory.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

But that argument is\nclearly wrong: If the general counsel had left the State’s\nemploy before submitting the recommendation, he could\nnot have taken the recommendation with him, and he\ncertainly could not have given it or sold it to someone else.\nTherefore, it is obvious that the recommendation (and the\nright to make it) were inextricably related to the general\ncounsel’s position with the government, and not to his\nbroader personal right to pursue the practice of law.\n   The general counsel’s job surely had economic value to\nhim, as did his labor as a lawyer, his law license, and his\nreputation as an attorney. But the indictment did not\nallege, and the jury did not find, that petitioner attempted\nto obtain those things. Nor would such a theory make\nsense in the context of this case. Petitioner did not, for\nexample, seek the general counsel’s legal advice or de-\nmand that the general counsel represent him in a legal\nproceeding. Cf. United States v. Thompson, 647 F. 3d 180,\n186–187 (CA5 2011) (a person’s labor is property capable\nof being extorted). Nor did petitioner attempt to enhance\nhis own ability to compete with the general counsel for\nlegal work by threatening to do something that would, say,\ntarnish the general counsel’s reputation or cause his law\nlicense to be revoked. Cf. Tropiano, 418 F. 2d, at 1071–\n1072, 1075–1077 (threats to competitor in order to obtain\ncustomers constitute extortion); United States v. Zemek,\n634 F. 2d 1159, 1173–1174 (CA9 1980) (same); United\nStates v. Coffey, 361 F. Supp. 2d 102, 108–109 (EDNY\n2005) (the right to pursue a lawful business is extortable\nproperty under the Hobbs Act).\n   The Court holds that petitioner’s conduct does not\namount to attempted extortion, but for a different reason:\nAccording to the Court, the alleged property that petition-\ner pursued was not transferrable and therefore is not\ncapable of being “obtained.” Ante, at 4–5, 7–8. Because I\n6                SEKHAR v.

National Organization for Women, Inc.,\n537 U. S. 393, 409 (2003). This is not to say that the\nGovernment could not have prosecuted petitioner for ex-\ntortion on these same facts under some other theory.\nThe question before us is whether the general counsel’s\nrecommendation—or the right to make it—constitutes\nproperty under the Hobbs Act.
