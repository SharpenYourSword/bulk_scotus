Argued December 9, 2013—Decided January 15, 2014\nRespondents, various union-affiliated benefit funds (Funds), sued peti-\n  tioner Ray Haluch Gravel Co. (Haluch) in Federal District Court to\n  collect benefits contributions required to be paid under federal law.\n  The Funds also sought attorney’s fees and costs, which were obliga-\n  tions under both a federal statute and the parties’ collective bargain-\n  ing agreement (CBA). The District Court issued an order on June 17,\n  2011, on the merits of the contribution claim and a separate ruling on\n  July 25 on the Funds’ motion for fees and costs. The Funds appealed\n  both decisions on August 15. Haluch argued that the June 17 order\n  was a final decision pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1291, and thus, the\n  Funds’ notice of appeal was untimely since it was not filed within the\n  Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure’s 30-day deadline. The Funds\n  disagreed, arguing that there was no final decision until July 25. The\n  First Circuit acknowledged that an unresolved attorney’s fees issue\n  generally does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final,\n  but held that no final decision was rendered until July 25 since the\n  entitlement to fees and costs provided for in the CBA was an element\n  of damages and thus part of the merits. Accordingly, the First Cir-\n  cuit addressed the appeal with respect to both the unpaid contribu-\n  tions and the fees and costs.\nHeld: The appeal of the June 17 decision was untimely. Pp. 5–13.\n    (a) This case has instructive similarities to Budinich v. Becton\n Dickinson & Co., 486 U. S. 196.

Id., at 200. Even if laws authorizing fees might some-\n times treat them as part of the merits, considerations of “operational\n consistency and predictability in the overall application of §1291” fa-\n vored a “uniform rule.” Id., at 202. Pp. 5–7.\n    (b) The Funds’ attempts to distinguish Budinich fail. Pp. 7–13.\n      (1) Their claim that contractual attorney’s fees provisions are al-\n ways a measure of damages is unpersuasive, for such provisions often\n provide attorney’s fees to prevailing defendants. More basic, Budi-\n nich’s uniform rule did not depend on whether the law authorizing a\n particular fee claim treated the fees as part of the merits, 486 U. S.,\n at 201, and there is no reason to depart from that sound reasoning\n here. The operational consistency stressed in Budinich is not pro-\n moted by providing for different jurisdictional effect based solely on\n whether an asserted right to fees is based on contract or statute. Nor\n is predictability promoted since it is not always clear whether and to\n what extent a fee claim is contractual rather than statutory. The\n Funds urge the importance of avoiding piecemeal litigation, but the\n Budinich Court was aware of such concerns when it adopted a uni-\n form rule, and it suffices to say that those concerns are counterbal-\n anced by the interest in determining with promptness and clarity\n whether the ruling on the merits will be appealed, especially given\n the complexity and amount of time it may take to resolve attorney’s\n fees claims. Furthermore, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure pro-\n vide a means to avoid a piecemeal approach in many cases. See, e.g.,\n Rules 54(d)(2), 58(e). Complex variations in statutory and contractu-\n al fee-shifting provisions also counsel against treating attorney’s fees\n claims authorized by contract and statute differently for finality pur-\n poses. The Budinich rule looks solely to the character of the issue\n that remains open after the court has otherwise ruled on the merits.\n The Funds suggest that it is unclear whether Budinich applies\n where, as here, nonattorney professional fees are included in a mo-\n tion for attorney’s fees and costs. They are mistaken to the extent\n that they suggest that such fees will be claimed only where a contrac-\n tual fee claim is involved. Many fee-shifting statutes authorize\n courts to award related litigation expenses like expert fees, see West\n Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, 89, n. 4, and\n there is no apparent reason why parties or courts would find it diffi-\n cult to tell that Budinich remains applicable where such fees are\n claimed and awarded incidental to attorney’s fees.

S. C. §1291. In Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co.,\n486 U. S. 196 (1988), this Court held that a decision on the\nmerits is a “final decision” under §1291 even if the award\nor amount of attorney’s fees for the litigation remains to\nbe determined. The issue in this case is whether a differ­\nent result obtains if the unresolved claim for attorney’s\nfees is based on a contract rather than, or in addition to, a\nstatute. The answer here, for purposes of §1291 and the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, is that the result is not\ndifferent. Whether the claim for attorney’s fees is based\non a statute, a contract, or both, the pendency of a ruling\non an award for fees and costs does not prevent, as a\ngeneral rule, the merits judgment from becoming final for\npurposes of appeal.\n2 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF\n  OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n                                I\n   Petitioner Ray Haluch Gravel Co. (Haluch) is a land­\nscape supply company. Under a collective-bargaining\nagreement (CBA) with the International Union of Operat­\ning Engineers, Local 98, Haluch was required to pay con­\ntributions to union-affiliated benefit funds. Various of\nthose funds are respondents here.\n   In 2007, respondents (Funds) commissioned an audit to\ndetermine whether Haluch was meeting its obligations\nunder the CBA. Based on the audit, the Funds demanded\nadditional contributions. Haluch refused to pay, and the\nFunds filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Massachusetts.\n   The Funds alleged that Haluch’s failure to make the\nrequired contributions was a violation of the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the\nLabor Management Relations Act, 1947. The Funds also\nsought attorney’s and auditor’s fees and costs, under\n§502(g)(2)(D) of ERISA, 94 Stat. 1295, 29 U. S. C.\n§1132(g)(2)(D) (providing for “reasonable attorney’s fees\nand costs of the action, to be paid by the defendant”),\nand the CBA itself, App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a (providing\nthat “[a]ny costs, including legal fees, of collecting pay­\nments due these Funds shall be borne by the defaulting\nEmployer”).\n   At the conclusion of a bench trial, the District Court\nasked the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law to allow the court “to consider both the\npossibility of enforcing [a] settlement and a decision on the\nmerits at the same time.” Tr. 50 (Feb. 28, 2011). These\nsubmissions were due on March 14, 2011. The District\nCourt went on to observe that “[u]nder our rules . . . if\nthere is a judgment for the plaintiffs, typically a motion\nfor attorney’s fees can be filed” shortly thereafter. Id., at\n51. It also noted that, “[o]n the other hand, attorney’s fees\nis part of the damages potentially here.” Ibid. It gave the\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplaintiffs the option to offer a submission with regard to\nfees along with their proposed findings of fact and conclu­\nsions of law, or to “wait to see if I find in your favor and\nsubmit the fee petition later on.” Ibid.\n   The Funds initially chose to submit their fee petition\nat the same time as their proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law, but they later changed course. They\nrequested an extension of time to file their “request for\nreimbursement of attorneys’ fees and costs in the above\nmatter.” Motion to Extend Time to Submit Request for\nAttorneys’ Fees in No. 09–cv–11607–MAP (D Mass.), p. 1.\nThe District Court agreed; and on April 4, the Funds\nmoved “for an [o]rder awarding the total attorneys’ fees\nand costs incurred . . . in attempting to collect this delin­\nquency, in obtaining the audit, in protecting Plaintiffs’\ninterests, and in protecting the interests of the partici­\npants and beneficiaries.” App. 72. The motion alleged\nthat “[t]hose fees and costs . . . amount to $143,600.44,”\nand stated that “[d]efendants are liable for these monies\npursuant to” ERISA, “and for the reasons detailed in the\naccompanying” affidavit. Ibid. The accompanying “affida­\nvit in support of [the] application for attorneys’ fees and\ncosts,” in turn, cited the parties’ agreements (including the\nCBA, as well as related trust agreements) and §502(g)\n(2)(D) of ERISA. Id., at 74.\n   As to the merits of the claim that Haluch had under­\npaid, on June 17, 2011, the District Court issued a memo­\nrandum and order ruling that the Funds were entitled to\ncertain unpaid contributions, though less than had been\nrequested.

Haluch filed a cross-appeal a\nweek later.\n   In the Court of Appeals Haluch argued that there had\nbeen no timely appeal from the June 17 decision on the\nmerits. In its view, the June 17 decision was a final deci­\nsion under §1291, so that notice of appeal had to be filed\nwithin 30 days thereafter, see Fed. Rule App. Proc.\n4(a)(1)(A). The Funds disagreed. They argued that there\nwas no final decision until July 25, when the District\nCourt rendered a decision on their request for attorney’s\nfees and costs. In their view the appeal was timely as to\nall issues in the case. See Digital Equipment Corp. v.\nDesktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 868 (1994).\n   The Court of Appeals agreed with the Funds. 695 F. 3d\n1, 7 (CA1 2012). It acknowledged this Court’s holding that\nan unresolved issue of attorney’s fees generally does not\nprevent judgment on the merits from being final. But it\nheld that this rule does not “mechanically . . . apply to all\nclaims for attorneys’ fees, whatever their genesis,” and\nthat, instead, “[w]here, as here, an entitlement to attor­\nneys’ fees derives from a contract . . . the critical question\nis whether the claim for attorneys’ fees is part of the mer­\nits.” Id., at 6. Interpreting the CBA in this case as\n“provid[ing] for the payment of attorneys’ fees as an ele­\nment of damages in the event of a breach,” the Court of\nAppeals held that the June 17 decision was not final. Ibid.\nConcluding that the appeal was timely as to all issues, the\nCourt of Appeals addressed the merits of the dispute with\nrespect to the amount of unpaid remittances as well as the\nissue of fees and costs, remanding both aspects of the case\nto the District Court. Id., at 11.\n   Haluch sought review here, and certiorari was granted\nto resolve a conflict in the Courts of Appeals over whether\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

For the reasons set forth,\nthe decision of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.\n                               II\n    Title 28 U. S. C. §1291 provides that “[t]he courts of\nappeals . . . shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final\ndecisions of the district courts of the United States . . . .”\n“[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a\njurisdictional requirement.” Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.\n205, 214 (2007). Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate\nProcedure provides, as a general matter and subject to\nspecific qualifications set out in later parts of the Rule,\nthat in a civil case “the notice of appeal . . . must be filed\n. . . within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order\nappealed from.” Rule 4(a)(1)(A). The parties in this case\nagree that notice of appeal was not given within 30 days of\nthe June 17 decision but that it was given within 30 days\nof the July 25 decision. The question is whether the June\n17 order was a final decision for purposes of §1291.\n    In the ordinary course a “final decision” is one that ends\n6 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF\n  OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nthe litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the\ncourt to do but execute the judgment. Catlin v. United\nStates, 324 U. S. 229, 233 (1945). In Budinich, this Court\naddressed the question whether an unresolved issue of at-\ntorney’s fees for the litigation prevents a judgment from be­\ning final. 486 U. S., at 202. There, a District Court in a\ndiversity case had entered a judgment that left unresolved\na motion for attorney’s fees based on a Colorado statute\nproviding attorney’s fees to prevailing parties in certain\ncases. Id., at 197. The Court held that the judgment was\nfinal for purposes of §1291 despite the unresolved issue of\nattorney’s fees. Id., at 202.\n   The Court in Budinich began by observing that “[a]s a\ngeneral matter, at least, . . . a claim for attorney’s fees is\nnot part of the merits of the action to which the fees per­\ntain.” Id., at 200. The Court noted that awards of at-\ntorney’s fees do not remedy the injury giving rise to the\naction, are often available to the party defending the action,\nand were regarded at common law as an element of “costs”\nawarded to a prevailing party, which are generally not\ntreated as part of the merits judgment. Ibid. Though the\nCourt acknowledged that the statutory or decisional law\nauthorizing the fees might sometimes treat the fees as\npart of the merits, it held that considerations of “opera­\ntional consistency and predictability in the overall applica­\ntion of §1291” favored a “uniform rule that an unresolved\nissue of attorney’s fees for the litigation in question does\nnot prevent judgment on the merits from being final.” Id.,\nat 202.\n   The facts of this case have instructive similarities to\nBudinich. In both cases, a plaintiff sought to recover\nemployment-related payments. In both cases, the District\nCourt entered a judgment resolving the claim for unpaid\namounts but left outstanding a request for attorney’s fees\nincurred in the course of litigating the case. Despite these\nsimilarities, the Funds offer two arguments to distinguish\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBudinich. First, they contend that unresolved claims for\nattorney’s fees authorized by contract, unlike those au­\nthorized by statute, are not collateral for finality purposes.\nSecond, they argue that the claim left unresolved as of\nJune 17 included fees incurred prior to the commencement\nof formal litigation and that those fees, at least, fall be­\nyond the scope of the rule announced in Budinich. For the\nreasons given below, the Court rejects these arguments.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n   The Funds’ principal argument for the nonfinality of the\nJune 17 decision is that a district court decision that does\nnot resolve a fee claim authorized by contract is not final\nfor purposes of §1291, because it leaves open a claim for\ncontract damages. They argue that contractual provi­\nsions for attorney’s fees or costs of collection, in contrast\nto statutory attorney’s fees provisions, are liquidated­\ndamages provisions intended to remedy the injury giving\nrise to the action.\n   The premise that contractual attorney’s fees provisions\nare always a measure of damages is unpersuasive, for\ncontractual fee provisions often provide attorney’s fees to\nprevailing defendants. See 1 R. Rossi, Attorneys’ Fees\n§9:25, p. 9–64 (3d ed. 2012); cf. Gleason, supra, at 137,\nn. 3. The Funds’ argument fails, however, for a more basic\nreason, which is that the Court in Budinich rejected the\nvery distinction the Funds now attempt to draw.\n   The decision in Budinich made it clear that the uniform\nrule there announced did not depend on whether the\nstatutory or decisional law authorizing a particular fee\nclaim treated the fees as part of the merits. 486 U. S., at\n201. The Court acknowledged that not all statutory or\ndecisional law authorizing attorney’s fees treats those fees\nas part of “costs” or otherwise not part of the merits; and\nthe Court even accepted for purposes of argument that the\n8 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF\n  OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nColorado statute in that case “ma[de] plain” that the fees\nit authorized “are to be part of the merits judgment.” Ibid.\nBut this did not matter. As the Court explained, the issue\nof attorney’s fees was still collateral for finality purposes\nunder §1291. The Court was not then, nor is it now,\n“inclined to adopt a disposition that requires the merits\nor nonmerits status of each attorney’s fee provision to be\nclearly established before the time to appeal can be clearly\nknown.” Id., at 202. There is no reason to depart here\nfrom this sound reasoning. By arguing that a different\nrule should apply to fee claims authorized by contract\nbecause they are more often a matter of damages and thus\npart of the merits, the Funds seek in substance to reliti­\ngate an issue already decided in Budinich.\n   Were the jurisdictional effect of an unresolved issue of\nattorney’s fees to depend on whether the entitlement to\nfees is asserted under a statute, as distinct from a con­\ntract, the operational consistency and predictability\nstressed in Budinich would be compromised in many\ninstances. Operational consistency is not promoted by\nproviding for different jurisdictional effect to district court\ndecisions that leave unresolved otherwise identical fee\nclaims based solely on whether the asserted right to fees is\nbased on a contract or a statute.\n   The Funds’ proposed distinction also does not promote\npredictability.   Although sometimes it may be clear\nwhether and to what extent a fee claim is contractual\nrather than statutory in nature, that is not always so.\nThis case provides an apt illustration. The Funds’ notice\nof motion itself cited just ERISA; only by consulting the\naccompanying affidavit, which included an oblique refer­\nence to the CBA, could it be discerned that a contractual\nfee claim was being asserted in that filing. This may\nexplain why the District Court’s July 25 decision cited\njust ERISA, without mention or analysis of the CBA provi-\nsion or any other contractual provision. 792 F. Supp. 2d,\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat 140.\n   The Funds urge the importance of avoiding piecemeal\nlitigation. The basic point is well taken, yet, in the context\nof distinguishing between different sources for awards of\nattorney’s fees, quite inapplicable. The Court was aware\nof piecemeal litigation concerns in Budinich, but it still\nadopted a uniform rule that an unresolved issue of attor­\nney’s fees for the litigation does not prevent judgment on\nthe merits from being final. Here it suffices to say that\nthe Funds’ concern over piecemeal litigation, though start­\ning from a legitimate principle, is counterbalanced by the\ninterest in determining with promptness and clarity\nwhether the ruling on the merits will be appealed. This\nis especially so because claims for attorney’s fees may be\ncomplex and require a considerable amount of time to\nresolve. Indeed, in this rather simple case, the fee-related\nsubmissions take up well over 100 pages in the joint ap­\npendix. App. 64–198.\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, furthermore,\nprovide a means to avoid a piecemeal approach in the\nordinary run of cases where circumstances warrant delay­\ning the time to appeal. Rule 54(d)(2) provides for motions\nclaiming attorney’s fees and related nontaxable expenses.\nRule 58(e), in turn, provides that the entry of judgment\nordinarily may not be delayed, nor may the time for ap­\npeal be extended, in order to tax costs or award fees. This\naccords with Budinich and confirms the general practice of\ntreating fees and costs as collateral for finality purposes.\nHaving recognized this premise, Rule 58(e) further pro­\nvides that if a timely motion for attorney’s fees is made\nunder Rule 54(d)(2), the court may act before a notice of\nappeal has been filed and become effective to order that\nthe motion have the same effect as a timely motion under\nRule 59 for purposes of Federal Rule of Appellate Proce­\ndure 4(a)(4). This delays the running of the time to file an\nappeal until the entry of the order disposing of the fee\n10 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF\n  OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nmotion. Rule 4(a)(4)(A)(iii).\n   In their brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari,\nthe Funds argued that in their case this procedure would\nnot have been applicable. Brief in Opposition 34. Rule\n54(d)(2) provides that “[a] claim for attorney’s fees and\nrelated nontaxable expenses must be made by motion\nunless the substantive law requires those fees to be proved\nat trial as an element of damages.” The Advisory Commit­\ntee Notes to Rule 54(d)(2) state that the procedure out­\nlined in that Rule “does not . . . apply to fees recoverable\nas an element of damages, as when sought under the\nterms of a contract; such damages typically are to be\nclaimed in a pleading and may involve issues to be re­\nsolved by a jury.” Advisory Committee’s 1993 Note on\nsubd. (d), par. (2) of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54, 28 U. S. C.\nApp., pp. 240–241.\n   The Funds no longer rely on their reading of Rule 54\nand the Advisory Committee Notes as a basis for their\nargument that the June 17 decision was not final under\n§1291. And this is not a case in which the parties at­\ntempted to invoke Rule 58(e) to delay the time to appeal.\nRegardless of how the Funds’ fee claims could or should\nhave been litigated, however, the Rules eliminate concerns\nover undue piecemeal appeals in the vast range of cases\nwhere a claim for attorney’s fees is made by motion under\nRule 54(d)(2). That includes some cases in which the fees\nare authorized by contract. See 2 M. Derfner & A. Wolf,\nCourt Awarded Attorney Fees ¶18.01[1][c], pp. 18–7 to 18–8\n(2013) (remarking that Rule 54(d)(2) applies “regardless\nof the statutory, contractual, or equitable basis of the\nrequest for fees,” though noting inapplicability where\nattorney’s fees are an element of damages under the sub­\nstantive law governing the action).\n   The complex variations in statutory and contractual fee­\nshifting provisions also counsel against making the dis­\ntinction the Funds suggest for purposes of finality. Some\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfee-shifting provisions treat the fees as part of the merits;\nsome do not. Some are bilateral, authorizing fees either\nto plaintiffs or defendants; some are unilateral. Some de­\npend on prevailing party status; some do not. Some may\nbe unclear on these points. The rule adopted in Budinich\nignores these distinctions in favor of an approach that\nlooks solely to the character of the issue that remains open\nafter the court has otherwise ruled on the merits of the\ncase.\n  In support of their argument against treating contrac­\ntual and statutory fee claims alike the Funds suggest,\nnevertheless, that it is unclear whether Budinich still\napplies where, as here, auditor’s fees (or other nonattorney\nprofessional fees) are included as an incidental part of a\nmotion for attorney’s fees and costs. (In this case, auditor’s\nfees accounted for $6,537 of the $143,600.44 requested\nin total.) To the extent the Funds suggest that similar\nfees will be claimed alongside attorney’s fees only where a\ncontractual fee claim is involved, they are incorrect. Stat­\nutory fee claims are not always limited to attorney’s fees\nper se. Many fee-shifting statutes authorize courts to\naward additional litigation expenses, such as expert fees.\nSee West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S.\n83, 89, n. 4 (1991) (listing statutes); cf. Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 54(d)(2)(A) (providing mechanism for claims by\nmotion for “attorney’s fees and related nontaxable expenses”).\nWhere, as here, those types of fees are claimed and\nawarded incidental to attorney’s fees, there is no apparent\nreason why parties or courts would find it difficult to tell\nthat Budinich remains applicable.\n                             B\n   The Funds separately contend that the June 17 decision\nwas not final because their motion claimed some $8,561.75\nin auditor’s and attorney’s fees (plus some modest addi­\ntional expenses) incurred prior to the commencement of\n12 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF\n  OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nlitigation. These included fees for the initial audit to\ndetermine whether Haluch was complying with the CBA,\nas well as attorney’s fees incurred in attempting to obtain\nrecords from Haluch, researching fund auditing rights,\ndrafting a letter demanding payment, and working on the\ninitial complaint. Brief for Respondents 4–5; App. 64–67,\n81–88. The Funds argue that these fees do not fall within\nthe scope of Budinich, because the Court in Budinich\nreferred only to fees “for the litigation in question,” 486\nU. S., at 202, or, equivalently, “attributable to the case,”\nid., at 203.\n    The fact that some of the claimed fees accrued before the\ncomplaint was filed is inconsequential. As this Court has\nobserved, “some of the services performed before a lawsuit\nis formally commenced by the filing of a complaint are\nperformed ‘on the litigation.’ ” Webb v. Dyer County Bd. of\nEd., 471 U. S. 234, 243 (1985). “Most obvious examples”\ninclude “the drafting of the initial pleadings and the work\nassociated with the development of the theory of the case.”\nIbid. More generally, pre-filing tasks may be for the liti­\ngation if they are “both useful and of a type ordinarily\nnecessary to advance the . . . litigation” in question. Ibid.\n    The fees in this case fit that description. Investigation,\npreliminary legal research, drafting of demand letters, and\nworking on the initial complaint are standard preliminary\nsteps toward litigation. See id., at 250 (Brennan, J., con­\ncurring in part and dissenting in part) (“[I]t is settled that\na prevailing party may recover fees for the time spent\nbefore the formal commencement of the litigation on such\nmatters as . . . investigation of the facts of the case, re­\nsearch on the viability of potential legal claims, [and]\ndrafting of the complaint and accompanying documents\n. . . .”); 2 Derfner, supra, ¶16.02[2][b], at 16–15 (“[H]ours\n. . . spent investigating facts specific to the client’s case\nshould be included in the lodestar, whether [or not] that\ntime is spent prior to the filing of a complaint”).

But that is not\nthis case.

Argued December 9, 2013—Decided January 15, 2014\nRespondents, various union-affiliated benefit funds (Funds), sued peti-\n  tioner Ray Haluch Gravel Co. (Haluch) in Federal District Court to\n  collect benefits contributions required to be paid under federal law.\n  The Funds also sought attorney’s fees and costs, which were obliga-\n  tions under both a federal statute and the parties’ collective bargain-\n  ing agreement (CBA). The District Court issued an order on June 17,\n  2011, on the merits of the contribution claim and a separate ruling on\n  July 25 on the Funds’ motion for fees and costs. The Funds appealed\n  both decisions on August 15. Haluch argued that the June 17 order\n  was a final decision pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1291, and thus, the\n  Funds’ notice of appeal was untimely since it was not filed within the\n  Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure’s 30-day deadline. The Funds\n  disagreed, arguing that there was no final decision until July 25. The\n  First Circuit acknowledged that an unresolved attorney’s fees issue\n  generally does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final,\n  but held that no final decision was rendered until July 25 since the\n  entitlement to fees and costs provided for in the CBA was an element\n  of damages and thus part of the merits. Accordingly, the First Cir-\n  cuit addressed the appeal with respect to both the unpaid contribu-\n  tions and the fees and costs.\nHeld: The appeal of the June 17 decision was untimely. Pp. 5–13.\n    (a) This case has instructive similarities to Budinich v. Becton\n Dickinson & Co., 486 U. S. 196.

Id., at 200. Even if laws authorizing fees might some-\n times treat them as part of the merits, considerations of “operational\n consistency and predictability in the overall application of §1291” fa-\n vored a “uniform rule.” Id., at 202. Pp. 5–7.\n    (b) The Funds’ attempts to distinguish Budinich fail. Pp. 7–13.\n      (1) Their claim that contractual attorney’s fees provisions are al-\n ways a measure of damages is unpersuasive, for such provisions often\n provide attorney’s fees to prevailing defendants. More basic, Budi-\n nich’s uniform rule did not depend on whether the law authorizing a\n particular fee claim treated the fees as part of the merits, 486 U. S.,\n at 201, and there is no reason to depart from that sound reasoning\n here. The operational consistency stressed in Budinich is not pro-\n moted by providing for different jurisdictional effect based solely on\n whether an asserted right to fees is based on contract or statute. Nor\n is predictability promoted since it is not always clear whether and to\n what extent a fee claim is contractual rather than statutory. The\n Funds urge the importance of avoiding piecemeal litigation, but the\n Budinich Court was aware of such concerns when it adopted a uni-\n form rule, and it suffices to say that those concerns are counterbal-\n anced by the interest in determining with promptness and clarity\n whether the ruling on the merits will be appealed, especially given\n the complexity and amount of time it may take to resolve attorney’s\n fees claims. Furthermore, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure pro-\n vide a means to avoid a piecemeal approach in many cases. See, e.g.,\n Rules 54(d)(2), 58(e). Complex variations in statutory and contractu-\n al fee-shifting provisions also counsel against treating attorney’s fees\n claims authorized by contract and statute differently for finality pur-\n poses. The Budinich rule looks solely to the character of the issue\n that remains open after the court has otherwise ruled on the merits.\n The Funds suggest that it is unclear whether Budinich applies\n where, as here, nonattorney professional fees are included in a mo-\n tion for attorney’s fees and costs. They are mistaken to the extent\n that they suggest that such fees will be claimed only where a contrac-\n tual fee claim is involved. Many fee-shifting statutes authorize\n courts to award related litigation expenses like expert fees, see West\n Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, 89, n. 4, and\n there is no apparent reason why parties or courts would find it diffi-\n cult to tell that Budinich remains applicable where such fees are\n claimed and awarded incidental to attorney’s fees.

S. C. §1291. In Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co.,\n486 U. S. 196 (1988), this Court held that a decision on the\nmerits is a “final decision” under §1291 even if the award\nor amount of attorney’s fees for the litigation remains to\nbe determined. The issue in this case is whether a differ­\nent result obtains if the unresolved claim for attorney’s\nfees is based on a contract rather than, or in addition to, a\nstatute. The answer here, for purposes of §1291 and the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, is that the result is not\ndifferent. Whether the claim for attorney’s fees is based\non a statute, a contract, or both, the pendency of a ruling\non an award for fees and costs does not prevent, as a\ngeneral rule, the merits judgment from becoming final for\npurposes of appeal.\n2 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF\n  OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n                                I\n   Petitioner Ray Haluch Gravel Co. (Haluch) is a land­\nscape supply company. Under a collective-bargaining\nagreement (CBA) with the International Union of Operat­\ning Engineers, Local 98, Haluch was required to pay con­\ntributions to union-affiliated benefit funds. Various of\nthose funds are respondents here.\n   In 2007, respondents (Funds) commissioned an audit to\ndetermine whether Haluch was meeting its obligations\nunder the CBA. Based on the audit, the Funds demanded\nadditional contributions. Haluch refused to pay, and the\nFunds filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Massachusetts.\n   The Funds alleged that Haluch’s failure to make the\nrequired contributions was a violation of the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the\nLabor Management Relations Act, 1947. The Funds also\nsought attorney’s and auditor’s fees and costs, under\n§502(g)(2)(D) of ERISA, 94 Stat. 1295, 29 U. S. C.\n§1132(g)(2)(D) (providing for “reasonable attorney’s fees\nand costs of the action, to be paid by the defendant”),\nand the CBA itself, App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a (providing\nthat “[a]ny costs, including legal fees, of collecting pay­\nments due these Funds shall be borne by the defaulting\nEmployer”).\n   At the conclusion of a bench trial, the District Court\nasked the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law to allow the court “to consider both the\npossibility of enforcing [a] settlement and a decision on the\nmerits at the same time.” Tr. 50 (Feb. 28, 2011). These\nsubmissions were due on March 14, 2011. The District\nCourt went on to observe that “[u]nder our rules . . . if\nthere is a judgment for the plaintiffs, typically a motion\nfor attorney’s fees can be filed” shortly thereafter. Id., at\n51. It also noted that, “[o]n the other hand, attorney’s fees\nis part of the damages potentially here.” Ibid. It gave the\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

They\nrequested an extension of time to file their “request for\nreimbursement of attorneys’ fees and costs in the above\nmatter.” Motion to Extend Time to Submit Request for\nAttorneys’ Fees in No. 09–cv–11607–MAP (D Mass.), p. 1.\nThe District Court agreed; and on April 4, the Funds\nmoved “for an [o]rder awarding the total attorneys’ fees\nand costs incurred . . . in attempting to collect this delin­\nquency, in obtaining the audit, in protecting Plaintiffs’\ninterests, and in protecting the interests of the partici­\npants and beneficiaries.” App. 72. The motion alleged\nthat “[t]hose fees and costs . . . amount to $143,600.44,”\nand stated that “[d]efendants are liable for these monies\npursuant to” ERISA, “and for the reasons detailed in the\naccompanying” affidavit. Ibid. The accompanying “affida­\nvit in support of [the] application for attorneys’ fees and\ncosts,” in turn, cited the parties’ agreements (including the\nCBA, as well as related trust agreements) and §502(g)\n(2)(D) of ERISA. Id., at 74.\n   As to the merits of the claim that Haluch had under­\npaid, on June 17, 2011, the District Court issued a memo­\nrandum and order ruling that the Funds were entitled to\ncertain unpaid contributions, though less than had been\nrequested.

CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF\n  OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nOn that date it awarded $18,000 in attorney’s fees, plus\ncosts of $16,688.15, for a total award of $34,688.15. 792\nF. Supp. 2d 139, 143. On August 15, 2011, the Funds ap-\npealed from both decisions. Haluch filed a cross-appeal a\nweek later.\n   In the Court of Appeals Haluch argued that there had\nbeen no timely appeal from the June 17 decision on the\nmerits. In its view, the June 17 decision was a final deci­\nsion under §1291, so that notice of appeal had to be filed\nwithin 30 days thereafter, see Fed. Rule App. Proc.\n4(a)(1)(A). The Funds disagreed. They argued that there\nwas no final decision until July 25, when the District\nCourt rendered a decision on their request for attorney’s\nfees and costs. In their view the appeal was timely as to\nall issues in the case. See Digital Equipment Corp. v.\nDesktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 868 (1994).\n   The Court of Appeals agreed with the Funds. 695 F. 3d\n1, 7 (CA1 2012). It acknowledged this Court’s holding that\nan unresolved issue of attorney’s fees generally does not\nprevent judgment on the merits from being final. But it\nheld that this rule does not “mechanically . . . apply to all\nclaims for attorneys’ fees, whatever their genesis,” and\nthat, instead, “[w]here, as here, an entitlement to attor­\nneys’ fees derives from a contract . . . the critical question\nis whether the claim for attorneys’ fees is part of the mer­\nits.” Id., at 6. Interpreting the CBA in this case as\n“provid[ing] for the payment of attorneys’ fees as an ele­\nment of damages in the event of a breach,” the Court of\nAppeals held that the June 17 decision was not final. Ibid.\nConcluding that the appeal was timely as to all issues, the\nCourt of Appeals addressed the merits of the dispute with\nrespect to the amount of unpaid remittances as well as the\nissue of fees and costs, remanding both aspects of the case\nto the District Court.

For the reasons set forth,\nthe decision of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.\n                               II\n    Title 28 U. S. C. §1291 provides that “[t]he courts of\nappeals . . . shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final\ndecisions of the district courts of the United States . . . .”\n“[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a\njurisdictional requirement.” Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.\n205, 214 (2007). Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate\nProcedure provides, as a general matter and subject to\nspecific qualifications set out in later parts of the Rule,\nthat in a civil case “the notice of appeal . . . must be filed\n. . . within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order\nappealed from.” Rule 4(a)(1)(A). The parties in this case\nagree that notice of appeal was not given within 30 days of\nthe June 17 decision but that it was given within 30 days\nof the July 25 decision. The question is whether the June\n17 order was a final decision for purposes of §1291.\n    In the ordinary course a “final decision” is one that ends\n6 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF\n  OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nthe litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the\ncourt to do but execute the judgment. Catlin v. United\nStates, 324 U. S. 229, 233 (1945). In Budinich, this Court\naddressed the question whether an unresolved issue of at-\ntorney’s fees for the litigation prevents a judgment from be­\ning final. 486 U. S., at 202. There, a District Court in a\ndiversity case had entered a judgment that left unresolved\na motion for attorney’s fees based on a Colorado statute\nproviding attorney’s fees to prevailing parties in certain\ncases. Id., at 197. The Court held that the judgment was\nfinal for purposes of §1291 despite the unresolved issue of\nattorney’s fees. Id., at 202.\n   The Court in Budinich began by observing that “[a]s a\ngeneral matter, at least, . . . a claim for attorney’s fees is\nnot part of the merits of the action to which the fees per­\ntain.” Id., at 200. The Court noted that awards of at-\ntorney’s fees do not remedy the injury giving rise to the\naction, are often available to the party defending the action,\nand were regarded at common law as an element of “costs”\nawarded to a prevailing party, which are generally not\ntreated as part of the merits judgment. Ibid. Though the\nCourt acknowledged that the statutory or decisional law\nauthorizing the fees might sometimes treat the fees as\npart of the merits, it held that considerations of “opera­\ntional consistency and predictability in the overall applica­\ntion of §1291” favored a “uniform rule that an unresolved\nissue of attorney’s fees for the litigation in question does\nnot prevent judgment on the merits from being final.” Id.,\nat 202.\n   The facts of this case have instructive similarities to\nBudinich. In both cases, a plaintiff sought to recover\nemployment-related payments. In both cases, the District\nCourt entered a judgment resolving the claim for unpaid\namounts but left outstanding a request for attorney’s fees\nincurred in the course of litigating the case. Despite these\nsimilarities, the Funds offer two arguments to distinguish\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBudinich. First, they contend that unresolved claims for\nattorney’s fees authorized by contract, unlike those au­\nthorized by statute, are not collateral for finality purposes.\nSecond, they argue that the claim left unresolved as of\nJune 17 included fees incurred prior to the commencement\nof formal litigation and that those fees, at least, fall be­\nyond the scope of the rule announced in Budinich. For the\nreasons given below, the Court rejects these arguments.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n   The Funds’ principal argument for the nonfinality of the\nJune 17 decision is that a district court decision that does\nnot resolve a fee claim authorized by contract is not final\nfor purposes of §1291, because it leaves open a claim for\ncontract damages. They argue that contractual provi­\nsions for attorney’s fees or costs of collection, in contrast\nto statutory attorney’s fees provisions, are liquidated­\ndamages provisions intended to remedy the injury giving\nrise to the action.\n   The premise that contractual attorney’s fees provisions\nare always a measure of damages is unpersuasive, for\ncontractual fee provisions often provide attorney’s fees to\nprevailing defendants. See 1 R. Rossi, Attorneys’ Fees\n§9:25, p. 9–64 (3d ed. 2012); cf. Gleason, supra, at 137,\nn. 3. The Funds’ argument fails, however, for a more basic\nreason, which is that the Court in Budinich rejected the\nvery distinction the Funds now attempt to draw.\n   The decision in Budinich made it clear that the uniform\nrule there announced did not depend on whether the\nstatutory or decisional law authorizing a particular fee\nclaim treated the fees as part of the merits. 486 U. S., at\n201. The Court acknowledged that not all statutory or\ndecisional law authorizing attorney’s fees treats those fees\nas part of “costs” or otherwise not part of the merits; and\nthe Court even accepted for purposes of argument that the\n8 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF\n  OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nColorado statute in that case “ma[de] plain” that the fees\nit authorized “are to be part of the merits judgment.” Ibid.\nBut this did not matter. As the Court explained, the issue\nof attorney’s fees was still collateral for finality purposes\nunder §1291. The Court was not then, nor is it now,\n“inclined to adopt a disposition that requires the merits\nor nonmerits status of each attorney’s fee provision to be\nclearly established before the time to appeal can be clearly\nknown.” Id., at 202. There is no reason to depart here\nfrom this sound reasoning. By arguing that a different\nrule should apply to fee claims authorized by contract\nbecause they are more often a matter of damages and thus\npart of the merits, the Funds seek in substance to reliti­\ngate an issue already decided in Budinich.\n   Were the jurisdictional effect of an unresolved issue of\nattorney’s fees to depend on whether the entitlement to\nfees is asserted under a statute, as distinct from a con­\ntract, the operational consistency and predictability\nstressed in Budinich would be compromised in many\ninstances. Operational consistency is not promoted by\nproviding for different jurisdictional effect to district court\ndecisions that leave unresolved otherwise identical fee\nclaims based solely on whether the asserted right to fees is\nbased on a contract or a statute.\n   The Funds’ proposed distinction also does not promote\npredictability.   Although sometimes it may be clear\nwhether and to what extent a fee claim is contractual\nrather than statutory in nature, that is not always so.\nThis case provides an apt illustration. The Funds’ notice\nof motion itself cited just ERISA; only by consulting the\naccompanying affidavit, which included an oblique refer­\nence to the CBA, could it be discerned that a contractual\nfee claim was being asserted in that filing. This may\nexplain why the District Court’s July 25 decision cited\njust ERISA, without mention or analysis of the CBA provi-\nsion or any other contractual provision. 792 F. Supp. 2d,\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat 140.\n   The Funds urge the importance of avoiding piecemeal\nlitigation. The basic point is well taken, yet, in the context\nof distinguishing between different sources for awards of\nattorney’s fees, quite inapplicable. The Court was aware\nof piecemeal litigation concerns in Budinich, but it still\nadopted a uniform rule that an unresolved issue of attor­\nney’s fees for the litigation does not prevent judgment on\nthe merits from being final. Here it suffices to say that\nthe Funds’ concern over piecemeal litigation, though start­\ning from a legitimate principle, is counterbalanced by the\ninterest in determining with promptness and clarity\nwhether the ruling on the merits will be appealed. This\nis especially so because claims for attorney’s fees may be\ncomplex and require a considerable amount of time to\nresolve. Indeed, in this rather simple case, the fee-related\nsubmissions take up well over 100 pages in the joint ap­\npendix. App. 64–198.\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, furthermore,\nprovide a means to avoid a piecemeal approach in the\nordinary run of cases where circumstances warrant delay­\ning the time to appeal. Rule 54(d)(2) provides for motions\nclaiming attorney’s fees and related nontaxable expenses.\nRule 58(e), in turn, provides that the entry of judgment\nordinarily may not be delayed, nor may the time for ap­\npeal be extended, in order to tax costs or award fees. This\naccords with Budinich and confirms the general practice of\ntreating fees and costs as collateral for finality purposes.\nHaving recognized this premise, Rule 58(e) further pro­\nvides that if a timely motion for attorney’s fees is made\nunder Rule 54(d)(2), the court may act before a notice of\nappeal has been filed and become effective to order that\nthe motion have the same effect as a timely motion under\nRule 59 for purposes of Federal Rule of Appellate Proce­\ndure 4(a)(4). This delays the running of the time to file an\nappeal until the entry of the order disposing of the fee\n10 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF\n  OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nmotion. Rule 4(a)(4)(A)(iii).\n   In their brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari,\nthe Funds argued that in their case this procedure would\nnot have been applicable. Brief in Opposition 34. Rule\n54(d)(2) provides that “[a] claim for attorney’s fees and\nrelated nontaxable expenses must be made by motion\nunless the substantive law requires those fees to be proved\nat trial as an element of damages.” The Advisory Commit­\ntee Notes to Rule 54(d)(2) state that the procedure out­\nlined in that Rule “does not . . . apply to fees recoverable\nas an element of damages, as when sought under the\nterms of a contract; such damages typically are to be\nclaimed in a pleading and may involve issues to be re­\nsolved by a jury.” Advisory Committee’s 1993 Note on\nsubd. (d), par. (2) of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54, 28 U. S. C.\nApp., pp. 240–241.\n   The Funds no longer rely on their reading of Rule 54\nand the Advisory Committee Notes as a basis for their\nargument that the June 17 decision was not final under\n§1291. And this is not a case in which the parties at­\ntempted to invoke Rule 58(e) to delay the time to appeal.\nRegardless of how the Funds’ fee claims could or should\nhave been litigated, however, the Rules eliminate concerns\nover undue piecemeal appeals in the vast range of cases\nwhere a claim for attorney’s fees is made by motion under\nRule 54(d)(2). That includes some cases in which the fees\nare authorized by contract. See 2 M. Derfner & A. Wolf,\nCourt Awarded Attorney Fees ¶18.01[1][c], pp. 18–7 to 18–8\n(2013) (remarking that Rule 54(d)(2) applies “regardless\nof the statutory, contractual, or equitable basis of the\nrequest for fees,” though noting inapplicability where\nattorney’s fees are an element of damages under the sub­\nstantive law governing the action).\n   The complex variations in statutory and contractual fee­\nshifting provisions also counsel against making the dis­\ntinction the Funds suggest for purposes of finality. Some\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfee-shifting provisions treat the fees as part of the merits;\nsome do not. Some are bilateral, authorizing fees either\nto plaintiffs or defendants; some are unilateral. Some de­\npend on prevailing party status; some do not. Some may\nbe unclear on these points. The rule adopted in Budinich\nignores these distinctions in favor of an approach that\nlooks solely to the character of the issue that remains open\nafter the court has otherwise ruled on the merits of the\ncase.\n  In support of their argument against treating contrac­\ntual and statutory fee claims alike the Funds suggest,\nnevertheless, that it is unclear whether Budinich still\napplies where, as here, auditor’s fees (or other nonattorney\nprofessional fees) are included as an incidental part of a\nmotion for attorney’s fees and costs. (In this case, auditor’s\nfees accounted for $6,537 of the $143,600.44 requested\nin total.) To the extent the Funds suggest that similar\nfees will be claimed alongside attorney’s fees only where a\ncontractual fee claim is involved, they are incorrect. Stat­\nutory fee claims are not always limited to attorney’s fees\nper se. Many fee-shifting statutes authorize courts to\naward additional litigation expenses, such as expert fees.\nSee West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S.\n83, 89, n. 4 (1991) (listing statutes); cf. Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 54(d)(2)(A) (providing mechanism for claims by\nmotion for “attorney’s fees and related nontaxable expenses”).\nWhere, as here, those types of fees are claimed and\nawarded incidental to attorney’s fees, there is no apparent\nreason why parties or courts would find it difficult to tell\nthat Budinich remains applicable.\n                             B\n   The Funds separately contend that the June 17 decision\nwas not final because their motion claimed some $8,561.75\nin auditor’s and attorney’s fees (plus some modest addi­\ntional expenses) incurred prior to the commencement of\n12 RAY HALUCH GRAVEL CO. v. CENTRAL PENSION FUND OF\n  OPERATING ENGINEERS AND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nlitigation. These included fees for the initial audit to\ndetermine whether Haluch was complying with the CBA,\nas well as attorney’s fees incurred in attempting to obtain\nrecords from Haluch, researching fund auditing rights,\ndrafting a letter demanding payment, and working on the\ninitial complaint. Brief for Respondents 4–5; App. 64–67,\n81–88. The Funds argue that these fees do not fall within\nthe scope of Budinich, because the Court in Budinich\nreferred only to fees “for the litigation in question,” 486\nU. S., at 202, or, equivalently, “attributable to the case,”\nid., at 203.\n    The fact that some of the claimed fees accrued before the\ncomplaint was filed is inconsequential. As this Court has\nobserved, “some of the services performed before a lawsuit\nis formally commenced by the filing of a complaint are\nperformed ‘on the litigation.’ ” Webb v. Dyer County Bd. of\nEd., 471 U. S. 234, 243 (1985). “Most obvious examples”\ninclude “the drafting of the initial pleadings and the work\nassociated with the development of the theory of the case.”\nIbid. More generally, pre-filing tasks may be for the liti­\ngation if they are “both useful and of a type ordinarily\nnecessary to advance the . . . litigation” in question. Ibid.\n    The fees in this case fit that description. Investigation,\npreliminary legal research, drafting of demand letters, and\nworking on the initial complaint are standard preliminary\nsteps toward litigation. See id., at 250 (Brennan, J., con­\ncurring in part and dissenting in part) (“[I]t is settled that\na prevailing party may recover fees for the time spent\nbefore the formal commencement of the litigation on such\nmatters as . . . investigation of the facts of the case, re­\nsearch on the viability of potential legal claims, [and]\ndrafting of the complaint and accompanying documents\n. . . .”); 2 Derfner, supra, ¶16.02[2][b], at 16–15 (“[H]ours\n. . . spent investigating facts specific to the client’s case\nshould be included in the lodestar, whether [or not] that\ntime is spent prior to the filing of a complaint”).

But that is not\nthis case.
