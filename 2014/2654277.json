ALABAMA\n       ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE\n\n        COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF ALABAMA\n\n             No. 13–6440   Decided February 24, 2014\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  In Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), we\nheld that a criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right\nto counsel is violated if his trial attorney’s performance\nfalls below an objective standard of reasonableness and if\nthere is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial\nwould have been different absent the deficient act or\nomission. Id., at 687–688, 694. Anthony Ray Hinton, an\ninmate on Alabama’s death row, asks us to decide whether\nthe Alabama courts correctly applied Strickland to his\ncase. We conclude that they did not and hold that Hin-\nton’s trial attorney rendered constitutionally deficient\nperformance. We vacate the lower court’s judgment and\nremand the case for reconsideration of whether the attor-\nney’s deficient performance was prejudicial.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  In February 1985, a restaurant manager in Birming-\nham was shot to death in the course of an after-hours rob-\nbery of his restaurant. A second manager was murdered\nduring a very similar robbery of another restaurant in\nJuly. Then, later in July, a restaurant manager named\nSmotherman survived another similar robbery-shooting.\nDuring each crime, the robber fired two .38 caliber bullets;\nall six bullets were recovered by police investigators.\nSmotherman described his assailant to the police, and\nwhen the police showed him a photographic array, he\npicked out Hinton’s picture.\n2                   HINTON v. ALABAMA\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   The police arrested Hinton and recovered from his house\na .38 caliber revolver belonging to his mother, who shared\nthe house with him. After analyzing the six bullets fired\nduring the three crimes and test-firing the revolver, exam-\niners at the State’s Department of Forensic Sciences\nconcluded that the six bullets had all been fired from\nthe same gun: the revolver found at Hinton’s house. Hin-\nton was charged with two counts of capital murder for\nthe killings during the first two robberies. He was not\ncharged in connection with the third robbery (that is, the\nSmotherman robbery).\n   At trial, the State’s strategy was to link Hinton to the\nSmotherman robbery through eyewitness testimony and\nforensic evidence about the bullets fired at Smotherman\nand then to persuade the jury that, in light of the similar-\nity of the three crimes and forensic analysis of the bullets\nand the Hinton revolver, Hinton must also have commit-\nted the two murders. Smotherman identified Hinton as\nthe man who robbed his restaurant and tried to kill him,\nand two other witnesses provided testimony that tended to\nlink Hinton to the Smotherman robbery. Hinton main-\ntained that he was innocent and that Smotherman had\nmisidentified him. In support of that defense, Hinton\npresented witnesses who testified in support of his alibi\nthat he was at work at a warehouse at the time of the\nSmotherman robbery.

Besides those items, the police found no evi-\ndence at the crime scenes that could be used to identify\nthe perpetrator (such as fingerprints) and no incriminat-\ning evidence at Hinton’s home or in his car. The State’s\ncase turned on whether its expert witnesses could con-\nvince the jury that the six recovered bullets had indeed\nbeen fired from the Hinton revolver.

Toolmark examiners\nattempt to determine whether a bullet recovered from a\ncrime scene was fired from a particular gun by comparing\nmicroscopic markings (toolmarks) on the recovered bullet\nto the markings on a bullet known to have been fired from\nthat gun. The theory is that minor differences even be-\ntween guns of the same model will leave discernible traces\non bullets that are unique enough for an examiner to\nconclude that the recovered bullet was or was not fired\nfrom a given weapon. See generally National Research\nCouncil, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United\nStates: A Path Forward 150–155 (2009).\n   Recognizing that Hinton’s defense called for an effective\nrebuttal of the State’s expert witnesses, Hinton’s attorney\nfiled a motion for funding to hire an expert witness of his\nown. In response, the trial judge granted $1,000 with this\nstatement:\n    “ ‘I don’t know as to what my limitations are as for\n    how much I can grant, but I can grant up to $500.00\n    in each case [that is, for each of the two murder\n    charges, which were tried together] as far as I know\n    right now and I’m granting up to $500.00 in each of\n    these two cases for this. So if you need additional ex-\n    perts I would go ahead and file on a separate form and\n    I’ll have to see if I can grant additional experts, but I\n    am granting up to $500.00, which is the statutory\n    maximum as far as I know on this and if it’s necessary\n    that we go beyond that then I may check to see if we\n    can, but this one’s granted.’ ” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1125605</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *59\n    (Ala.

An earlier\nversion of the statute had limited state reimbursement of\nexpenses to one half of the $1,000 statutory cap on attor-\nney’s fees, which explains why the judge believed that\nHinton was entitled to up to $500 for each of the two\nmurder charges.

That amendment went into\neffect on June 13, 1984, Dubose, supra, at 1177, n. 5,\nwhich was over a year before Hinton was arrested, so\nHinton’s trial attorney could have corrected the trial\njudge’s mistaken belief that a $1,000 limit applied and\naccepted his invitation to file a motion for additional\nfunds.\n   The attorney failed to do so because he was himself\nunaware that Alabama law no longer imposed a specific\nlimit and instead allowed reimbursement for “any expenses\nreasonably incurred.” At an evidentiary hearing held on\nHinton’s postconviction petition, the following conversa-\ntion occurred between a state attorney and Hinton’s trial\nattorney:\n    “Q. You did an awful lot of work to try and find what \n\n    you believed to be a qualified expert in this case, \n\n    didn’t you?\n\n    “A. Yes, sir, I did. \n\n    “Q.

Yes, sir, I think so.\n    “Q. And this case, did it come down to an unwilling-\n    ness of experts to work for the price that you were\n    able to pay?\n    “A. Yes, sir, I think it did.\n    “Q. So your failure to get an expert that you would\n    have been let’s say a hundred percent satisfied with\n    was not a failure on your part to go out and do some\n    act, it was a failure of the court to approve what you\n    believed would have been sufficient funds?\n    “A. Well, putting it a little differently, yes, sir, it was\n    a failure—it was my failure, my inability under the\n    statute to obtain any more funding for the purpose of\n    hiring qualified experts.” Reporter’s Official Tr. 206–\n    207 (emphasis added).\n   Operating under the mistaken belief that he could pay\nno more than $1,000, Hinton’s attorney went looking for\nan expert witness. According to his postconviction testi-\nmony, he made an extensive search for a well-regarded\nexpert, but found only one person who was willing to take\nthe case for the pay he could offer: Andrew Payne. Hin-\nton’s attorney “testified that Payne did not have the exper-\ntise he thought he needed and that he did not consider\nPayne’s testimony to be effective.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1125605</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *27.\nAs he told the trial judge during a pretrial hearing:\n    “I made an effort to get somebody that I thought\n    would be useable. And I’ll have to tell you what I did\n    [about] Payne. I called a couple of other lawyers in\n    town . . . to ask if they knew of anybody. One of them\n    knew him; one of them knew him. The reason I didn’t\n    contact him was because he wasn’t recommended by\n    the lawyer. So now I’m stuck that he’s the only guy I\n    could possibly produce.” Id., at *30 (internal quota-\n    tion marks omitted).\n  At trial, Payne testified that the toolmarks in the barrel\n6                  HINTON v. ALABAMA\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nof the Hinton revolver had been corroded away so that it\nwould be impossible to say with certainty whether a par-\nticular bullet had been fired from that gun. He also testi-\nfied that the bullets from the three crime scenes did not\nmatch one another. The State’s two experts, by contrast,\nmaintained that all six bullets had indeed been fired from\nthe Hinton revolver.\n   On cross-examination, the prosecutor badly discredited\nPayne. Payne admitted that he’d testified as an expert on\nfirearms and toolmark identification just twice in the\npreceding eight years and that one of the two cases in-\nvolved a shotgun rather than a handgun. Payne also\nconceded that he had had difficulty operating the micro-\nscope at the state forensic laboratory and had asked for\nhelp from one of the state experts. The prosecutor ended\nthe cross-examination with this colloquy:\n    “Q. Mr. Payne, do you have some problem with your\n\n    vision? \n\n    “A. Why, yes.\n\n    “Q. How many eyes do you have? \n\n    “A. One.” Tr. 1667. \n\n   The prosecutor’s closing argument highlighted the fact\nthat Payne’s expertise was in military ordnance, not fire-\narms and toolmark identification, and that Payne had\ngraduated in 1933 (more than half a century before the\ntrial) with a degree in civil engineering, whereas the\nState’s experts had years of training and experience in the\nfield of firearms and toolmark examination. The prosecu-\ntor said:\n    “ ‘I ask you to reject [Payne’s] testimony and you have\n    that option because you are the judges of the facts and\n    whose testimony, Mr. Yates’ or Mr. Payne’s, you will\n    give credence to, and I submit to you that as between\n    these two men there is no match between them.\n    There is no comparison.

The trial\njudge accepted that recommendation and imposed a death\nsentence.\n                               B\n   In his state postconviction petition, Hinton contended\nthat his trial attorney was “ ‘ineffective to not seek addi-\ntional funds when it became obvious that the individual\nwilling to examine the evidence in the case for the $1,000\nallotted by the court was incompetent and unqualified.\nIndeed, this failure to seek additional, sufficient funds is\nrendered all the more inexplicable by the trial court’s\nexpress invitation to counsel to seek more funds if such\nfunds were necessary.’ ” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1125605</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *28.\n   To show that he had been prejudiced by Payne’s ineffec-\ntive testimony, Hinton produced three new experts on\ntoolmark evidence. One of the three, a forensic consultant\nnamed John Dillon, had worked on toolmark identification\nat the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s forensics labora-\ntory and, from 1988 until he retired in 1994, had served as\nchief of the firearms and toolmark unit at the FBI’s head-\nquarters.     The other two postconviction experts had\nworked for many years as firearms and toolmark examin-\ners at the Dallas County Crime Laboratory and had each\ntestified as toolmark experts in several hundred cases.\n   All three experts examined the physical evidence and\ntestified that they could not conclude that any of the six\nbullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver. The State\ndid not submit rebuttal evidence during the postconviction\nhearing, and one of Hinton’s experts testified that, pursu-\nant to the ethics code of his trade organization, the Associ-\n8                   HINTON v.

Yates refused to cooperate.\n                             C\n   The circuit court denied Hinton’s postconviction petition\non the ground that Hinton had not been prejudiced by\nPayne’s allegedly poor performance because Payne’s tes-\ntimony did not depart from what Hinton’s postconviction\nexperts had said: The bullets could not be affirmatively\nmatched either to one another or to the Hinton revolver.\n   The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed by a\n3-to-2 vote. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1125605</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The court agreed with the\ncircuit court that Hinton had not been prejudiced because\nPayne’s testimony, if believed by the jury, strongly sup-\nported the inference that Hinton was innocent. Id., at *31.\nThen-Judge Cobb (who later became chief justice of the\nAlabama Supreme Court) dissented. In her view, Hinton’s\nattorney had been ineffective in failing to seek additional\nfunds to hire a better expert and Hinton had been preju-\ndiced by that failure, meaning that he was entitled to a\nnew trial. Then-Judge Shaw (who is now a justice of the\nAlabama Supreme Court) also dissented. He would have\nremanded the case to the circuit court to make a finding as\nto whether or not Payne was qualified to act as an expert\non toolmark evidence. He stated that “[i]t goes without\nsaying that, with knowledge that sufficient funds were\navailable to have a qualified firearms and toolmarks ex-\npert, no reasonable criminal defense lawyer would seek\nout and hire an unqualified firearms witness.” Id., at *73.\n   The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed and remanded.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4603723</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

The\nSupreme Court was thus focused on Payne’s own qualifi-\ncations, rather than on whether a better expert—one who\ncould have been hired had the attorney learned that there\nwas no funding cap and requested additional funds—\nwould have made a more compelling case for Hinton.\n  On remand, the circuit court held that Payne was in-\ndeed qualified to testify as a firearms and toolmark expert\nwitness under the Alabama evidentiary standard in place\nat the time of the trial, which required only that Payne\nhave had “knowledge of firearms and toolmarks exam-\nination beyond that of an average layperson.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">5517591</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *5 (Ala.

ALABAMA\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nentails that defendants are entitled to be represented by\nan attorney who meets at least a minimal standard of\ncompetence. Id., at 685–687. “Under Strickland, we first\ndetermine whether counsel’s representation ‘fell below an\nobjective standard of reasonableness.’      Then we ask\nwhether ‘there is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed-\ning would have been different.’ ” Padilla v. Kentucky, 559\nU. S. 356, 366 (2010) (quoting Strickland, supra, at 688,\n694).\n                             A\n   “The first prong—constitutional deficiency—is neces-\nsarily linked to the practice and expectations of the legal\ncommunity: ‘The proper measure of attorney performance\nremains simply reasonableness under prevailing profes-\nsional norms.’ ” Padilla, supra, at 366 (quoting Strickland,\nsupra, at 688). “In any case presenting an ineffectiveness\nclaim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel’s\nassistance was reasonable considering all the circum-\nstances.” Strickland, supra, at 688. Under that standard,\nit was unreasonable for Hinton’s lawyer to fail to seek\nadditional funds to hire an expert where that failure was\nbased not on any strategic choice but on a mistaken belief\nthat available funding was capped at $1,000.\n   “Criminal cases will arise where the only reasonable\nand available defense strategy requires consultation with\nexperts or introduction of expert evidence.” Harrington v.\nRichter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16). This\nwas such a case. As Hinton’s trial attorney recognized,\nthe core of the prosecution’s case was the state experts’\nconclusion that the six bullets had been fired from the\nHinton revolver, and effectively rebutting that case re-\nquired a competent expert on the defense side. Hinton’s\nattorney also recognized that Payne was not a good expert,\nat least with respect to toolmark evidence. Nonetheless,\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nhe felt he was “stuck” with Payne because he could not\nfind a better expert willing to work for $1,000 and he\nbelieved that he was unable to obtain more than $1,000 to\ncover expert fees.\n   As discussed above, that belief was wrong: Alabama law\nin effect beginning more than a year before Hinton was\narrested provided for state reimbursement of “any expenses\nreasonably incurred in such defense to be approved in\nadvance by the trial court.” Ala. Code §15–12–21(d). And\nthe trial judge expressly invited Hinton’s attorney to file a\nrequest for further funds if he felt that more funding was\nnecessary. Yet the attorney did not seek further funding.\n   The trial attorney’s failure to request additional funding\nin order to replace an expert he knew to be inadequate\nbecause he mistakenly believed that he had received all he\ncould get under Alabama law constituted deficient perfor-\nmance. Under Strickland, “strategic choices made after\nthorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausi-\nble options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic\nchoices made after less than complete investigation are\nreasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable profes-\nsional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\nIn other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable\ninvestigations or to make a reasonable decision that\nmakes particular investigations unnecessary.” 466 U. S.,\nat 690–691. Hinton’s attorney knew that he needed more\nfunding to present an effective defense, yet he failed to\nmake even the cursory investigation of the state statute\nproviding for defense funding for indigent defendants that\nwould have revealed to him that he could receive reim-\nbursement not just for $1,000 but for “any expenses rea-\nsonably incurred.” An attorney’s ignorance of a point of\nlaw that is fundamental to his case combined with his\nfailure to perform basic research on that point is a quin-\ntessential example of unreasonable performance under\nStrickland. See, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362,\n12                  HINTON v. ALABAMA\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n395 (2000) (finding deficient performance where counsel\n“failed to conduct an investigation that would have uncov-\nered extensive records [that could be used for death penalty\nmitigation purposes], not because of any strategic calcu-\nlation but because they incorrectly thought that state law\nbarred access to such records”); Kimmelman v. Morrison,\n477 U. S. 365, 385 (1986) (finding deficient performance\nwhere counsel failed to conduct pretrial discovery and that\nfailure “was not based on ‘strategy,’ but on counsel’s mis-\ntaken belie[f ] that the State was obliged to take the initia-\ntive and turn over all of its inculpatory evidence to the\ndefense”).\n   We wish to be clear that the inadequate assistance of\ncounsel we find in this case does not consist of the hiring\nof an expert who, though qualified, was not qualified\nenough. The selection of an expert witness is a paradig-\nmatic example of the type of “strategic choic[e]” that, when\nmade “after thorough investigation of [the] law and facts,”\nis “virtually unchallengeable.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n690. We do not today launch federal courts into examina-\ntion of the relative qualifications of experts hired and\nexperts that might have been hired. The only inadequate\nassistance of counsel here was the inexcusable mistake of\nlaw—the unreasonable failure to understand the resources\nthat state law made available to him—that caused counsel\nto employ an expert that he himself deemed inadequate.\n                              B\n   Having established deficient performance, Hinton must\nalso “show that there is a reasonable probability that, but\nfor counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the pro-\nceeding would have been different. A reasonable probabil-\nity is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\nthe outcome.” Id., at 694. “When a defendant challenges a\nconviction, the question is whether there is a reasonable\nprobability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

It is true that Payne’s testimony would have\ndone Hinton a lot of good if the jury had believed it. But\nthe jury did not believe Payne. And if there is a reasona-\nble probability that Hinton’s attorney would have hired an\nexpert who would have instilled in the jury a reasonable\ndoubt as to Hinton’s guilt had the attorney known that the\nstatutory funding limit had been lifted, then Hinton was\nprejudiced by his lawyer’s deficient performance and is\nentitled to a new trial.\n   That the State presented testimony from two experi-\nenced expert witnesses that tended to inculpate Hinton\ndoes not, taken alone, demonstrate that Hinton is guilty.\nProsecution experts, of course, can sometimes make mis-\ntakes. Indeed, we have recognized the threat to fair crim-\ninal trials posed by the potential for incompetent or fraud-\nulent prosecution forensics experts, noting that “[s]erious\ndeficiencies have been found in the forensic evidence used\nin criminal trials. . . . One study of cases in which exon-\nerating evidence resulted in the overturning of criminal\nconvictions concluded that invalid forensic testimony\ncontributed to the convictions in 60% of the cases.”\nMelendez-Diaz v.

Washington, 466 U.

Id., at 687–688, 694. Anthony Ray Hinton, an\ninmate on Alabama’s death row, asks us to decide whether\nthe Alabama courts correctly applied Strickland to his\ncase. We conclude that they did not and hold that Hin-\nton’s trial attorney rendered constitutionally deficient\nperformance. We vacate the lower court’s judgment and\nremand the case for reconsideration of whether the attor-\nney’s deficient performance was prejudicial.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  In February 1985, a restaurant manager in Birming-\nham was shot to death in the course of an after-hours rob-\nbery of his restaurant. A second manager was murdered\nduring a very similar robbery of another restaurant in\nJuly. Then, later in July, a restaurant manager named\nSmotherman survived another similar robbery-shooting.\nDuring each crime, the robber fired two .38 caliber bullets;\nall six bullets were recovered by police investigators.\nSmotherman described his assailant to the police, and\nwhen the police showed him a photographic array, he\npicked out Hinton’s picture.\n2                   HINTON v. ALABAMA\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   The police arrested Hinton and recovered from his house\na .38 caliber revolver belonging to his mother, who shared\nthe house with him. After analyzing the six bullets fired\nduring the three crimes and test-firing the revolver, exam-\niners at the State’s Department of Forensic Sciences\nconcluded that the six bullets had all been fired from\nthe same gun: the revolver found at Hinton’s house. Hin-\nton was charged with two counts of capital murder for\nthe killings during the first two robberies. He was not\ncharged in connection with the third robbery (that is, the\nSmotherman robbery).\n   At trial, the State’s strategy was to link Hinton to the\nSmotherman robbery through eyewitness testimony and\nforensic evidence about the bullets fired at Smotherman\nand then to persuade the jury that, in light of the similar-\nity of the three crimes and forensic analysis of the bullets\nand the Hinton revolver, Hinton must also have commit-\nted the two murders. Smotherman identified Hinton as\nthe man who robbed his restaurant and tried to kill him,\nand two other witnesses provided testimony that tended to\nlink Hinton to the Smotherman robbery. Hinton main-\ntained that he was innocent and that Smotherman had\nmisidentified him. In support of that defense, Hinton\npresented witnesses who testified in support of his alibi\nthat he was at work at a warehouse at the time of the\nSmotherman robbery. See 548 So. 2d 562, 568–569 (Ala.\n1989) (summarizing the evidence on each side of the case).\n   The six bullets and the revolver were the only physical\nevidence. Besides those items, the police found no evi-\ndence at the crime scenes that could be used to identify\nthe perpetrator (such as fingerprints) and no incriminat-\ning evidence at Hinton’s home or in his car. The State’s\ncase turned on whether its expert witnesses could con-\nvince the jury that the six recovered bullets had indeed\nbeen fired from the Hinton revolver. According to the\nAlabama Supreme Court, “the only evidence linking Hin-\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nton to the two murders were forensic comparisons of the\nbullets recovered from those crime scenes to the Hinton\nrevolver.” 2008 WL 4603723, *2 (Oct. 17, 2008).\n   The category of forensic evidence at issue in this case is\n“firearms and toolmark” evidence. Toolmark examiners\nattempt to determine whether a bullet recovered from a\ncrime scene was fired from a particular gun by comparing\nmicroscopic markings (toolmarks) on the recovered bullet\nto the markings on a bullet known to have been fired from\nthat gun. The theory is that minor differences even be-\ntween guns of the same model will leave discernible traces\non bullets that are unique enough for an examiner to\nconclude that the recovered bullet was or was not fired\nfrom a given weapon. See generally National Research\nCouncil, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United\nStates: A Path Forward 150–155 (2009).\n   Recognizing that Hinton’s defense called for an effective\nrebuttal of the State’s expert witnesses, Hinton’s attorney\nfiled a motion for funding to hire an expert witness of his\nown. In response, the trial judge granted $1,000 with this\nstatement:\n    “ ‘I don’t know as to what my limitations are as for\n    how much I can grant, but I can grant up to $500.00\n    in each case [that is, for each of the two murder\n    charges, which were tried together] as far as I know\n    right now and I’m granting up to $500.00 in each of\n    these two cases for this. So if you need additional ex-\n    perts I would go ahead and file on a separate form and\n    I’ll have to see if I can grant additional experts, but I\n    am granting up to $500.00, which is the statutory\n    maximum as far as I know on this and if it’s necessary\n    that we go beyond that then I may check to see if we\n    can, but this one’s granted.’ ” 2006 WL 1125605, *59\n    (Ala. Crim. App., Apr. 28, 2006) (Cobb, J., dissenting)\n    (quoting Tr. 10).\n4                   HINTON v. ALABAMA\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nHinton’s attorney did not take the judge up on his invita-\ntion to file a request for more funding.\n   In fact, $500 per case ($1,000 total) was not the statu-\ntory maximum at the time of Hinton’s trial. An earlier\nversion of the statute had limited state reimbursement of\nexpenses to one half of the $1,000 statutory cap on attor-\nney’s fees, which explains why the judge believed that\nHinton was entitled to up to $500 for each of the two\nmurder charges. See Smelley v. State, 564 So. 2d 74, 88\n(Ala. Crim. App. 1990). But the relevant statute had been\namended to provide: “ ‘Counsel shall also be entitled to be\nreimbursed for any expenses reasonably incurred in such\ndefense to be approved in advance by the trial court.’ ” See\nDubose v. State, 662 So. 2d 1156, 1177, n. 5 (Ala. Crim.\nApp. 1993) (quoting Ala. Code §15–12–21(d) (1984)), aff ’d\n662 So. 2d 1189 (Ala. 1995). That amendment went into\neffect on June 13, 1984, Dubose, supra, at 1177, n. 5,\nwhich was over a year before Hinton was arrested, so\nHinton’s trial attorney could have corrected the trial\njudge’s mistaken belief that a $1,000 limit applied and\naccepted his invitation to file a motion for additional\nfunds.\n   The attorney failed to do so because he was himself\nunaware that Alabama law no longer imposed a specific\nlimit and instead allowed reimbursement for “any expenses\nreasonably incurred.” At an evidentiary hearing held on\nHinton’s postconviction petition, the following conversa-\ntion occurred between a state attorney and Hinton’s trial\nattorney:\n    “Q. You did an awful lot of work to try and find what \n\n    you believed to be a qualified expert in this case, \n\n    didn’t you?\n\n    “A. Yes, sir, I did. \n\n    “Q. Would you characterize it that you did everything\n\n    that you knew to do? \n\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n    “A. Yes, sir, I think so.\n    “Q. And this case, did it come down to an unwilling-\n    ness of experts to work for the price that you were\n    able to pay?\n    “A. Yes, sir, I think it did.\n    “Q. So your failure to get an expert that you would\n    have been let’s say a hundred percent satisfied with\n    was not a failure on your part to go out and do some\n    act, it was a failure of the court to approve what you\n    believed would have been sufficient funds?\n    “A. Well, putting it a little differently, yes, sir, it was\n    a failure—it was my failure, my inability under the\n    statute to obtain any more funding for the purpose of\n    hiring qualified experts.” Reporter’s Official Tr. 206–\n    207 (emphasis added).\n   Operating under the mistaken belief that he could pay\nno more than $1,000, Hinton’s attorney went looking for\nan expert witness. According to his postconviction testi-\nmony, he made an extensive search for a well-regarded\nexpert, but found only one person who was willing to take\nthe case for the pay he could offer: Andrew Payne. Hin-\nton’s attorney “testified that Payne did not have the exper-\ntise he thought he needed and that he did not consider\nPayne’s testimony to be effective.” 2006 WL 1125605, *27.\nAs he told the trial judge during a pretrial hearing:\n    “I made an effort to get somebody that I thought\n    would be useable. And I’ll have to tell you what I did\n    [about] Payne. I called a couple of other lawyers in\n    town . . . to ask if they knew of anybody. One of them\n    knew him; one of them knew him. The reason I didn’t\n    contact him was because he wasn’t recommended by\n    the lawyer. So now I’m stuck that he’s the only guy I\n    could possibly produce.” Id., at *30 (internal quota-\n    tion marks omitted).\n  At trial, Payne testified that the toolmarks in the barrel\n6                  HINTON v. ALABAMA\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nof the Hinton revolver had been corroded away so that it\nwould be impossible to say with certainty whether a par-\nticular bullet had been fired from that gun. He also testi-\nfied that the bullets from the three crime scenes did not\nmatch one another. The State’s two experts, by contrast,\nmaintained that all six bullets had indeed been fired from\nthe Hinton revolver.\n   On cross-examination, the prosecutor badly discredited\nPayne. Payne admitted that he’d testified as an expert on\nfirearms and toolmark identification just twice in the\npreceding eight years and that one of the two cases in-\nvolved a shotgun rather than a handgun. Payne also\nconceded that he had had difficulty operating the micro-\nscope at the state forensic laboratory and had asked for\nhelp from one of the state experts. The prosecutor ended\nthe cross-examination with this colloquy:\n    “Q. Mr. Payne, do you have some problem with your\n\n    vision? \n\n    “A. Why, yes.\n\n    “Q. How many eyes do you have? \n\n    “A. One.” Tr. 1667. \n\n   The prosecutor’s closing argument highlighted the fact\nthat Payne’s expertise was in military ordnance, not fire-\narms and toolmark identification, and that Payne had\ngraduated in 1933 (more than half a century before the\ntrial) with a degree in civil engineering, whereas the\nState’s experts had years of training and experience in the\nfield of firearms and toolmark examination. The prosecu-\ntor said:\n    “ ‘I ask you to reject [Payne’s] testimony and you have\n    that option because you are the judges of the facts and\n    whose testimony, Mr. Yates’ or Mr. Payne’s, you will\n    give credence to, and I submit to you that as between\n    these two men there is no match between them.\n    There is no comparison. One man just doesn’t have it\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n    and the other does it day in and day out, month in and\n    month out, year in and year out, and is recognized\n    across the state as an expert.’ ” 2006 WL 1125605,\n    *64 (Cobb, J., dissenting) (quoting Tr. 1733–1734).\n  The jury convicted Hinton and recommended by a 10-\nto-2 vote that he be sentenced to death. The trial\njudge accepted that recommendation and imposed a death\nsentence.\n                               B\n   In his state postconviction petition, Hinton contended\nthat his trial attorney was “ ‘ineffective to not seek addi-\ntional funds when it became obvious that the individual\nwilling to examine the evidence in the case for the $1,000\nallotted by the court was incompetent and unqualified.\nIndeed, this failure to seek additional, sufficient funds is\nrendered all the more inexplicable by the trial court’s\nexpress invitation to counsel to seek more funds if such\nfunds were necessary.’ ” 2006 WL 1125605, *28.\n   To show that he had been prejudiced by Payne’s ineffec-\ntive testimony, Hinton produced three new experts on\ntoolmark evidence. One of the three, a forensic consultant\nnamed John Dillon, had worked on toolmark identification\nat the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s forensics labora-\ntory and, from 1988 until he retired in 1994, had served as\nchief of the firearms and toolmark unit at the FBI’s head-\nquarters.     The other two postconviction experts had\nworked for many years as firearms and toolmark examin-\ners at the Dallas County Crime Laboratory and had each\ntestified as toolmark experts in several hundred cases.\n   All three experts examined the physical evidence and\ntestified that they could not conclude that any of the six\nbullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver. The State\ndid not submit rebuttal evidence during the postconviction\nhearing, and one of Hinton’s experts testified that, pursu-\nant to the ethics code of his trade organization, the Associ-\n8                   HINTON v. ALABAMA\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nation of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners, he had asked\nthe State’s expert, Yates, to show him how he had deter-\nmined that the recovered bullets had been fired from the\nHinton revolver. Yates refused to cooperate.\n                             C\n   The circuit court denied Hinton’s postconviction petition\non the ground that Hinton had not been prejudiced by\nPayne’s allegedly poor performance because Payne’s tes-\ntimony did not depart from what Hinton’s postconviction\nexperts had said: The bullets could not be affirmatively\nmatched either to one another or to the Hinton revolver.\n   The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed by a\n3-to-2 vote. 2006 WL 1125605. The court agreed with the\ncircuit court that Hinton had not been prejudiced because\nPayne’s testimony, if believed by the jury, strongly sup-\nported the inference that Hinton was innocent. Id., at *31.\nThen-Judge Cobb (who later became chief justice of the\nAlabama Supreme Court) dissented. In her view, Hinton’s\nattorney had been ineffective in failing to seek additional\nfunds to hire a better expert and Hinton had been preju-\ndiced by that failure, meaning that he was entitled to a\nnew trial. Then-Judge Shaw (who is now a justice of the\nAlabama Supreme Court) also dissented. He would have\nremanded the case to the circuit court to make a finding as\nto whether or not Payne was qualified to act as an expert\non toolmark evidence. He stated that “[i]t goes without\nsaying that, with knowledge that sufficient funds were\navailable to have a qualified firearms and toolmarks ex-\npert, no reasonable criminal defense lawyer would seek\nout and hire an unqualified firearms witness.” Id., at *73.\n   The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed and remanded.\n2008 WL 4603723. After quoting at length from Judge\nShaw’s dissent, the Court stated, “We agree with Judge\nShaw that ‘the dispositive issue is whether Payne was a\nqualified firearms and toolmarks expert’ and that in deny-\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\ning Hinton’s [postconviction] petition the trial court did\nnot directly rule on ‘the issue whether Payne was qualified\nto be testifying in the first place.’ ” Id., at *4 (quoting\n2006 WL 1125605, *70, *72 (Shaw, J., dissenting)). The\nSupreme Court was thus focused on Payne’s own qualifi-\ncations, rather than on whether a better expert—one who\ncould have been hired had the attorney learned that there\nwas no funding cap and requested additional funds—\nwould have made a more compelling case for Hinton.\n  On remand, the circuit court held that Payne was in-\ndeed qualified to testify as a firearms and toolmark expert\nwitness under the Alabama evidentiary standard in place\nat the time of the trial, which required only that Payne\nhave had “knowledge of firearms and toolmarks exam-\nination beyond that of an average layperson.” 2008 WL\n5517591, *5 (Ala. Crim. App., Dec. 19, 2008); see also\nCharles v. State, 350 So. 2d 730, 733 (Ala. Crim. App.\n1977) (“An ‘expert witness’ is one who can enlighten a jury\nmore than the average man in the street. . . . An expert\nwitness, by definition, is any person whose opportunity or\nmeans of knowledge in a specialized art or science is to\nsome degree better than that found in the average juror or\nwitness”). The appellate court affirmed the circuit court’s\nruling that Payne was qualified under the applicable\nstandard. 2013 WL 598122 (Ala. Crim. App., Feb. 15,\n2013). The Alabama Supreme Court denied review by a 4-\nto-3 vote, with two justices recused. Hinton then filed this\npetition for a writ of certiorari.\n                               II\n   This case calls for a straightforward application of our\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel precedents, beginning with\nStrickland v.

Id., at 685–687. “Under Strickland, we first\ndetermine whether counsel’s representation ‘fell below an\nobjective standard of reasonableness.’      Then we ask\nwhether ‘there is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed-\ning would have been different.’ ” Padilla v. Kentucky, 559\nU. S. 356, 366 (2010) (quoting Strickland, supra, at 688,\n694).\n                             A\n   “The first prong—constitutional deficiency—is neces-\nsarily linked to the practice and expectations of the legal\ncommunity: ‘The proper measure of attorney performance\nremains simply reasonableness under prevailing profes-\nsional norms.’ ” Padilla, supra, at 366 (quoting Strickland,\nsupra, at 688). “In any case presenting an ineffectiveness\nclaim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel’s\nassistance was reasonable considering all the circum-\nstances.” Strickland, supra, at 688. Under that standard,\nit was unreasonable for Hinton’s lawyer to fail to seek\nadditional funds to hire an expert where that failure was\nbased not on any strategic choice but on a mistaken belief\nthat available funding was capped at $1,000.\n   “Criminal cases will arise where the only reasonable\nand available defense strategy requires consultation with\nexperts or introduction of expert evidence.” Harrington v.\nRichter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16). This\nwas such a case. As Hinton’s trial attorney recognized,\nthe core of the prosecution’s case was the state experts’\nconclusion that the six bullets had been fired from the\nHinton revolver, and effectively rebutting that case re-\nquired a competent expert on the defense side. Hinton’s\nattorney also recognized that Payne was not a good expert,\nat least with respect to toolmark evidence. Nonetheless,\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nhe felt he was “stuck” with Payne because he could not\nfind a better expert willing to work for $1,000 and he\nbelieved that he was unable to obtain more than $1,000 to\ncover expert fees.\n   As discussed above, that belief was wrong: Alabama law\nin effect beginning more than a year before Hinton was\narrested provided for state reimbursement of “any expenses\nreasonably incurred in such defense to be approved in\nadvance by the trial court.” Ala. Code §15–12–21(d). And\nthe trial judge expressly invited Hinton’s attorney to file a\nrequest for further funds if he felt that more funding was\nnecessary. Yet the attorney did not seek further funding.\n   The trial attorney’s failure to request additional funding\nin order to replace an expert he knew to be inadequate\nbecause he mistakenly believed that he had received all he\ncould get under Alabama law constituted deficient perfor-\nmance. Under Strickland, “strategic choices made after\nthorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausi-\nble options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic\nchoices made after less than complete investigation are\nreasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable profes-\nsional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\nIn other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable\ninvestigations or to make a reasonable decision that\nmakes particular investigations unnecessary.” 466 U. S.,\nat 690–691. Hinton’s attorney knew that he needed more\nfunding to present an effective defense, yet he failed to\nmake even the cursory investigation of the state statute\nproviding for defense funding for indigent defendants that\nwould have revealed to him that he could receive reim-\nbursement not just for $1,000 but for “any expenses rea-\nsonably incurred.” An attorney’s ignorance of a point of\nlaw that is fundamental to his case combined with his\nfailure to perform basic research on that point is a quin-\ntessential example of unreasonable performance under\nStrickland. See, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362,\n12                  HINTON v. ALABAMA\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n395 (2000) (finding deficient performance where counsel\n“failed to conduct an investigation that would have uncov-\nered extensive records [that could be used for death penalty\nmitigation purposes], not because of any strategic calcu-\nlation but because they incorrectly thought that state law\nbarred access to such records”); Kimmelman v. Morrison,\n477 U. S. 365, 385 (1986) (finding deficient performance\nwhere counsel failed to conduct pretrial discovery and that\nfailure “was not based on ‘strategy,’ but on counsel’s mis-\ntaken belie[f ] that the State was obliged to take the initia-\ntive and turn over all of its inculpatory evidence to the\ndefense”).\n   We wish to be clear that the inadequate assistance of\ncounsel we find in this case does not consist of the hiring\nof an expert who, though qualified, was not qualified\nenough. The selection of an expert witness is a paradig-\nmatic example of the type of “strategic choic[e]” that, when\nmade “after thorough investigation of [the] law and facts,”\nis “virtually unchallengeable.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n690. We do not today launch federal courts into examina-\ntion of the relative qualifications of experts hired and\nexperts that might have been hired. The only inadequate\nassistance of counsel here was the inexcusable mistake of\nlaw—the unreasonable failure to understand the resources\nthat state law made available to him—that caused counsel\nto employ an expert that he himself deemed inadequate.\n                              B\n   Having established deficient performance, Hinton must\nalso “show that there is a reasonable probability that, but\nfor counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the pro-\nceeding would have been different. A reasonable probabil-\nity is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\nthe outcome.” Id., at 694. “When a defendant challenges a\nconviction, the question is whether there is a reasonable\nprobability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nhave had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.” Id., at 695.\n   The Court of Criminal Appeals held, and the State\ncontends in its brief in opposition to certiorari, that Hinton\ncould not have been prejudiced by his attorney’s use of\nPayne rather than a more qualified expert because Payne\nsaid all that Hinton could have hoped for from a toolmark\nexpert: that the bullets used in the crimes could not\nhave been fired from the Hinton revolver. See 2006 WL\n1125605, *31 (“[E]ven assuming that counsel’s apparent\nignorance that the cap on expert expenses had been lifted\nconstituted deficient performance . . . , the appellant has\nnot shown that he was prejudiced by that deficient per-\nformance”). It is true that Payne’s testimony would have\ndone Hinton a lot of good if the jury had believed it. But\nthe jury did not believe Payne. And if there is a reasona-\nble probability that Hinton’s attorney would have hired an\nexpert who would have instilled in the jury a reasonable\ndoubt as to Hinton’s guilt had the attorney known that the\nstatutory funding limit had been lifted, then Hinton was\nprejudiced by his lawyer’s deficient performance and is\nentitled to a new trial.\n   That the State presented testimony from two experi-\nenced expert witnesses that tended to inculpate Hinton\ndoes not, taken alone, demonstrate that Hinton is guilty.\nProsecution experts, of course, can sometimes make mis-\ntakes. Indeed, we have recognized the threat to fair crim-\ninal trials posed by the potential for incompetent or fraud-\nulent prosecution forensics experts, noting that “[s]erious\ndeficiencies have been found in the forensic evidence used\nin criminal trials. . . . One study of cases in which exon-\nerating evidence resulted in the overturning of criminal\nconvictions concluded that invalid forensic testimony\ncontributed to the convictions in 60% of the cases.”\nMelendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U. S. 305, 319 (2009)\n(citing Garrett & Neufeld, Invalid Forensic Science Testi-\nmony and Wrongful Convictions, 95 Va. L. Rev. 1, 14\n14                  HINTON v. ALABAMA\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n(2009)). This threat is minimized when the defense re-\ntains a competent expert to counter the testimony of the\nprosecution’s expert witnesses; it is maximized when the\ndefense instead fails to understand the resources available\nto it by law.\n   Because no court has yet evaluated the prejudice ques-\ntion by applying the proper inquiry to the facts of this\ncase, we remand the case for reconsideration of whether\nHinton’s attorney’s deficient performance was prejudicial\nunder Strickland.\n                        *     *    *\n  The petition for certiorari and Hinton’s motion for leave\nto proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment of\nthe Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama is vacated, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings not incon-\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2654277/", "sha1": "3536e881660b5c6ddd5db07459f3e62a1aab2bb8", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-018", "time_retrieved": "2014-02-24T09:01:44.659038"}
