HOEPER\n\n      CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF COLORADO\n\n  No. 12–315.      Argued December 9, 2013—Decided January 27, 2014\nRespondent Hoeper was a pilot for petitioner Air Wisconsin Airlines\n  Corp. When Air Wisconsin stopped flying from Hoeper’s home base\n  on aircraft that he was certified to fly, he needed to become certified\n  on a different type of aircraft to keep his job. After Hoeper failed in\n  his first three attempts to gain certification, Air Wisconsin agreed to\n  give him a fourth and final chance. But he performed poorly during a\n  required training session in a simulator. Hoeper responded angrily\n  to this failure—raising his voice, tossing his headset, using profanity,\n  and accusing the instructor of “railroading the situation.”\n     The instructor called an Air Wisconsin manager, who booked\n  Hoeper on a flight from the test location to Hoeper’s home in Denver.\n  Several hours later, the manager discussed Hoeper’s behavior with\n  other airline officials. The officials discussed Hoeper’s outburst, his\n  impending termination, the history of assaults by disgruntled airline\n  employees, and the chance that—because Hoeper was a Federal\n  Flight Deck Officer (FFDO), permitted “to carry a firearm while en-\n  gaged in providing air transportation,” 49 U. S. C. §44921(f)(1)—he\n  might be armed. At the end of the meeting, an airline executive\n  made the decision to notify the Transportation Security Administra-\n  tion (TSA) of the situation. The manager who had received the initial\n  report from Hoeper’s instructor made the call to the TSA. During\n  that call, according to the jury, he made two statements: first, that\n  Hoeper “was an FFDO who may be armed” and that the airline was\n  “concerned about his mental stability and the whereabouts of his\n  firearm”; and second, that an “[u]nstable pilot in [the] FFDO program\n  was terminated today.” In response, the TSA removed Hoeper from\n  his plane, searched him, and questioned him about the location of his\n  gun. Hoeper eventually boarded a later flight to Denver, and Air\n  Wisconsin fired him the next day.\n2            AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       Hoeper sued for defamation in Colorado state court. Air Wisconsin\n    moved for summary judgment and later for a directed verdict, relying\n    on the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which\n    grants airlines and their employees immunity against civil liability\n    for reporting suspicious behavior, 49 U. S. C. §44941(a), except where\n    such disclosure is “made with actual knowledge that the disclosure\n    was false, inaccurate, or misleading” or “made with reckless disre-\n    gard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure,” §44941(b). The trial\n    court denied the motions and submitted the ATSA immunity ques-\n    tion to the jury. The jury found for Hoeper on the defamation claim.\n    The State Supreme Court affirmed. It held that the trial court erred\n    in submitting the immunity question to the jury but that the error\n    was harmless. Laboring under the assumption that even true state-\n    ments do not qualify for ATSA immunity if they are made recklessly,\n    the court held that Air Wisconsin was not entitled to immunity be-\n    cause its statements to the TSA were made with reckless disregard of\n    their truth or falsity.\nHeld:\n    1. ATSA immunity may not be denied to materially true state-\n ments. Pp. 7–11.\n       (a) The ATSA immunity exception is patterned after the actual\n malice standard of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254,\n which requires material falsity. See, e.g., Masson v. New Yorker\n Magazine, Inc., 501 U. S. 496, 517. Because the material falsity re-\n quirement was settled when the ATSA was enacted, Congress pre-\n sumably meant to incorporate it into the ATSA’s immunity exception\n and did not mean to deny ATSA immunity to true statements made\n recklessly. This presumption is not rebutted by other indicia of stat-\n utory meaning. Section 44941(b)(1) requires falsity, and §44941(b)(2)\n simply extends the immunity exception from knowing falsehoods to\n reckless ones. Denying immunity for substantially true reports, on\n the theory that the person making the report had not yet gathered\n enough information to be certain of its truth, would defeat the pur-\n pose of ATSA immunity: to ensure that air carriers and their employ-\n ees do not hesitate to provide the TSA with needed information.\n Pp. 7–10.\n       (b) Hoeper’s arguments that the State Supreme Court’s judgment\n should be affirmed notwithstanding its misapprehension of ATSA’s\n immunity standard are unpersuasive. Hoeper claims that Air Wis-\n consin did not argue the truth of its statements in asserting immuni-\n ty, but Air Wisconsin contended in the state court that ATSA’s im-\n munity exception incorporates the New York Times actual malice\n standard, which requires material falsity. And the State Supreme\n Court did not perform the requisite analysis of material falsity in\n                   Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nfinding the record sufficient to support the defamation verdict. A\ncourt’s deferential review of jury findings cannot substitute for its\nown analysis of the record; the jury was instructed only to determine\nfalsity, not materiality; and applying the material falsity standard to\na defamation claim is quite different from applying it to ATSA im-\nmunity. Pp. 10–11.\n   2. Under the correct material falsity analysis, Air Wisconsin is en-\ntitled to immunity as a matter of law. Pp. 12–18.\n      (a) In the defamation context, a materially false statement is one\nthat “ ‘would have a different effect on the mind of the reader [or lis-\ntener] from that which the . . . truth would have produced.’ ” Masson,\n501 U. S., at 517. This standard suffices in the ATSA context as well,\nso long as the hypothetical reader or listener is a security officer. For\npurposes of ATSA immunity, a falsehood cannot be material absent a\nsubstantial likelihood that a reasonable security officer would consid-\ner it important in determining a response to the supposed threat.\nPp. 12–13.\n      (b) Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hoeper,\nthe Court concludes as a matter of law that any falsehoods in Air\nWisconsin’s statement to the TSA were not material. First, the Court\nrejects Hoeper’s argument that Air Wisconsin should have qualified\nits statement that Hoeper “was an FFDO who may be armed” by not-\ning that it had no reason to think he actually was armed. To the ex-\ntent that Air Wisconsin’s statement could have been confusing, any\nsuch confusion is immaterial, as a reasonable TSA officer—having\nbeen told that Hoeper was an FFDO who was upset about losing his\njob—would have wanted to investigate whether he was armed. To\ndemand more precise wording would vitiate the purpose of ATSA\nimmunity: to encourage air carriers and their employees, often in\nfast-moving situations and with little time to fine-tune their diction,\nto provide the TSA immediately with information about potential\nthreats. Second, Air Wisconsin’s statement that Hoeper “was termi-\nnated today” was not materially false. While Hoeper had not actually\nbeen fired at the time of the statement, everyone involved knew that\nhis firing was imminent. No reasonable TSA officer would care\nwhether an angry, potentially armed airline employee had just been\nfired or merely knew he was about to meet that fate. Finally, alt-\nhough the details of Hoeper’s behavior during the simulator session\nmay be disputed, it would have been correct even under Hoeper’s ver-\nsion of the facts for Air Wisconsin to report that Hoeper “blew up”\nduring the test. From a reasonable security officer’s perspective,\nthere is no material difference between a statement that Hoeper had\n“blown up” in a professional setting and a statement that he was un-\nstable. Air Wisconsin’s related statement that it was “concerned\n4           AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    about [Hoeper’s] mental stability” is no more troubling. Many of the\n    officials who attended the meeting at airline headquarters might not\n    have framed their concerns in terms of “mental stability,” but it\n    would be inconsistent with the ATSA’s text and purpose to expose Air\n    Wisconsin to liability because the manager who placed the call to the\n    TSA could have chosen a slightly better phrase to articulate the air-\n    line’s concern. A statement that would otherwise qualify for ATSA\n    immunity cannot lose that immunity because of some minor impreci-\n    sion, so long as “the gist” of the statement is accurate, Masson, 501\n    U.

WILLIAM L. HOEPER \n\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF \n\n                      COLORADO\n\n                              [January 27, 2014]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In 2001, Congress created the Transportation Security\nAdministration (TSA) to assess and manage threats against\nair travel. Aviation and Transportation Security Act\n(ATSA), 49 U. S. C. §44901 et seq. To ensure that the\nTSA would be informed of potential threats, Congress gave\nairlines and their employees immunity against civil liabil-\nity for reporting suspicious behavior. §44941(a). But this\nimmunity does not attach to “any disclosure made with\nactual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate,\nor misleading” or “any disclosure made with reckless\ndisregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure.”\n§44941(b).\n   The question before us is whether ATSA immunity may\nbe denied under §44941(b) without a determination that a\ndisclosure was materially false. We hold that it may not.\nBecause the state courts made no such determination, and\nbecause any falsehood in the disclosure here would not\nhave affected a reasonable security officer’s assessment of\nthe supposed threat, we reverse the judgment of the Colo-\nrado Supreme Court.\n2        AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   William Hoeper joined Air Wisconsin Airlines Corpora-\ntion as a pilot in 1998. But by late 2004, Air Wisconsin\nhad stopped operating flights from Denver, Hoeper’s home\nbase, on any type of aircraft for which he was certified. To\ncontinue flying for Air Wisconsin out of Denver, Hoeper\nneeded to gain certification on the British Aerospace 146\n(BAe-146), an aircraft he had not flown.\n   Hoeper failed in his first three attempts to pass a profi-\nciency test. After the third failure, as he later acknowl-\nedged at trial, his employment was “at [Air Wisconsin’s]\ndiscretion.” App. 193. But he and Air Wisconsin entered\ninto an agreement to afford him “one more opportunity to\npass [the] proficiency check.” Id., at 426. The agreement\nleft little doubt that Hoeper would lose his job if he failed\nagain.\n   In December 2004, Hoeper flew from Denver to Virginia\nfor simulator training as part of this final test. During the\ntraining, Hoeper failed to cope with a challenging scenario\ncreated by the instructor, Mark Schuerman, and the simu-\nlator showed the engines “flam[ing] out” due to a loss of\nfuel. App. 203. As Schuerman began to tell Hoeper that\nhe “should know better,” ibid., Hoeper responded angrily.\nHe later described what happened:\n    “At this point, that’s it. I take my headset off and I\n    toss it up on the glare shield. . . . [Schuerman] and I\n    exchanged words at the same elevated decibel level.\n    Mine went something like this: This is a bunch of shit.\n    I’m sorry. You are railroading the situation and it’s\n    not realistic.” Id., at 203–204.\nWhen Hoeper announced that he wanted to call the legal\ndepartment of the pilots’ union, Schuerman ended the\nsession so that Hoeper could do so. Schuerman then re-\nported Hoeper’s behavior to Patrick Doyle, the Wisconsin-\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbased manager of the BAe-146 fleet. Doyle booked Hoeper\non a United Airlines flight back to Denver.\n   Several hours after Schuerman’s report, Doyle discussed\nthe situation at Air Wisconsin’s headquarters with the\nairline’s Vice President of Operations, Kevin LaWare; its\nManaging Director of Flight Operations, Scott Orozco; and\nits Assistant Chief Pilot, Robert Frisch. LaWare later ex-\nplained the accretion of his concerns about what Hoeper\nmight do next. He regarded Hoeper’s behavior in the\nsimulator as “a fairly significant outburst,” of a sort that\nhe “hadn’t seen . . . before.” Id., at 276. And he knew “it\nwas a given that . . . Hoeper’s employment was . . . going\nto be terminated” as a result of his failure to complete the\nsimulator training. Id., at 278.\n   Then, LaWare testified, Orozco mentioned that Hoeper\nwas a Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO). The FFDO\nprogram allows the Government to “deputize volunteer\npilots of air carriers . . . to defend the flight decks of air-\ncraft . . . against acts of criminal violence or air piracy.”\n§44921(a). FFDOs are permitted “to carry a firearm while\nengaged in providing air transportation.” §44921(f )(1).\nHoeper had become an FFDO earlier in 2004 and had been\nissued a firearm. He was not allowed to carry the firearm\nduring his trip to the training facility, because he was not\n“engaged in providing air transportation,” ibid. But ac-\ncording to one official at the meeting, the Denver airport’s\nsecurity procedures made it possible for crew members to\nbypass screening, so that Hoeper could have carried his\ngun despite the rule. Indeed, Frisch later testified that he\nwas “aware of one” incident in which an Air Wisconsin\npilot had come to training with his FFDO weapon. App.\n292. On the basis of this information, LaWare concluded,\nthere was “no way . . . to confirm” whether “Hoeper had\nhis weapon with him, even though . . . by policy, [he was]\nnot supposed to have it with him.” Id., at 279.\n   Finally, LaWare testified, he and the other Air Wiscon-\n4        AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsin officials discussed two prior episodes in which disgrun-\ntled airline employees had lashed out violently. Id., at\n280. In one incident, a FedEx flight engineer under inves-\ntigation for misconduct “entered the cockpit” of a FedEx\nflight “and began attacking the crew with a hammer”\nbefore being subdued. United States v. Calloway, 116\nF. 3d 1129, 1131 (CA6 1997). In another, a recently fired\nticket agent brought a gun onto a Pacific Southwest Air-\nlines flight and shot his former supervisor and the crew,\nleading to a fatal crash. Malnic, Report Confirms That\nGunman Caused 1987 Crash of PSA Jet, L. A. Times,\nJan. 6, 1989, p. 29.\n   In light of all this—Hoeper’s anger, his impending ter-\nmination, the chance that he might be armed, and the\nhistory of assaults by disgruntled airline employees—\nLaWare decided that the airline “need[ed] to make a call\nto the TSA,” to let the authorities know “the status” of the\nsituation. App. 282.\n   Doyle offered to make the call. According to the jury, he\nmade two statements to the TSA: first, that Hoeper “was\nan FFDO who may be armed” and that the airline was\n“concerned about his mental stability and the whereabouts\nof his firearm”; and second, that an “[u]nstable pilot in\n[the] FFDO program was terminated today.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 111a. (The latter statement appears in the rec-\nord as the subject line of an internal TSA e-mail, summa-\nrizing the call from Doyle. App. 414.)\n   The TSA responded to the call by ordering that Hoeper’s\nplane return to the gate. Officers boarded the plane, re-\nmoved Hoeper, searched him, and questioned him about\nthe location of his gun. When Hoeper stated that the gun\nwas at his home in Denver, a Denver-based federal agent\nwent there to retrieve it.\n   Later that day, Hoeper boarded a return flight to Den-\nver. Air Wisconsin fired him the following day.\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

The\ncase went to trial, and the court denied Air Wisconsin’s\nmotion for a directed verdict on the same basis. It submit-\nted the question of ATSA immunity to the jury, with the\ninstruction—following the language of §44941(b)—that\nimmunity would not apply if Hoeper had proved that\nAir Wisconsin “made the disclosure [to the TSA] with ac-\ntual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or\nmisleading” or “with reckless disregard as to its truth or\nfalsity.” App. 582. The jury instructions did not state that\nATSA immunity protects materially true statements.\n  The jury found for Hoeper on the defamation claim and\nawarded him $849,625 in compensatory damages and\n$391,875 in punitive damages. The court reduced the\nlatter award to $350,000, for a total judgment of just\nunder $1.2 million, plus costs.\n  The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed. 232 P. 3d 230\n(2009). It held “that the trial court properly submitted the\nATSA immunity issue to the jury,” that “the record sup-\n——————\n  1 Air Wisconsin agrees that it bears responsibility for Doyle’s state-\n\nments. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">907764</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *2, *16, n. 2 (Colo., Mar. 19, 2012).\n  2 The ATSA immunity provision specifies that “[a]ny air carrier . . . or\n\nany employee of an air carrier . . . who makes a voluntary disclosure\nof any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or\nregulation, relating to air piracy, a threat to aircraft or passenger\nsafety, or terrorism, . . . to any employee or agent of the Department of\nTransportation, the Department of Justice, any Federal, State, or local\nlaw enforcement officer, or any airport or airline security officer shall\nnot be civilly liable to any person under any law or regulation of the\nUnited States, any constitution, law, or regulation of any State or\npolitical subdivision of any State, for such disclosure.” 49 U.

It began by holding, contrary to\nthe lower courts, “that immunity under the ATSA is a\nquestion of law to be determined by the trial court before\ntrial.” Id., at *4. But it concluded that the trial court’s\nerror in submitting immunity to the jury was “harmless\nbecause Air Wisconsin is not entitled to immunity.” Id., at\n*6. In a key footnote, the court stated: “In our determina-\ntion of immunity under the ATSA, we need not, and there-\nfore do not, decide whether the statements were true or\nfalse. Rather, we conclude that Air Wisconsin made the\nstatements with reckless disregard as to their truth or\nfalsity.” Id., at *16, n. 6. The court thus appears to\nhave labored under the assumption that even true state-\nments do not qualify for ATSA immunity if they are made\nrecklessly.\n   Applying this standard, and giving “no weight to the\njury’s finding[s],” ibid., n. 5, the court held that “[a]l-\nthough the events at the training may have warranted\na report to TSA,” Air Wisconsin’s statements “overstated\nthose events to such a degree that they were made with\nreckless disregard of their truth or falsity.” Id., at *7. The\ncourt opined that Air Wisconsin “would likely be immune\nunder the ATSA if Doyle had reported that Hoeper was an\nAir Wisconsin employee, that he knew he would be termi-\nnated soon, that he had acted irrationally at the training\nthree hours earlier and ‘blew up’ at test administrators,\nand that he was an FFDO pilot.” Id., at *8. But because\nDoyle actually told TSA “(1) that he believed Hoeper to be\nmentally unstable; (2) that Hoeper had been terminated\nearlier that day; and (3) that Hoeper may have been\narmed,” id., at *7, the court determined that his state-\nments “went well beyond” the facts and did not qualify for\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

The court went on to conclude that\nthe evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s defama-\ntion verdict.\n   Justice Eid, joined by two others, dissented in part. She\nagreed with the majority’s holding that immunity is an\nissue for the court, not the jury. But she reasoned that Air\nWisconsin was entitled to immunity “because [its] state-\nments to the TSA were substantially true.” Id., at *11.\n   We granted certiorari to decide “[w]hether ATSA im-\nmunity may be denied without a determination that the\nair carrier’s disclosure was materially false.” 570 U. S. ___\n(2013).\n                            II\n\n                             A\n\n  Congress patterned the exception to ATSA immunity\nafter the actual malice standard of New York Times Co. v.\nSullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), and we have long held that\nactual malice requires material falsity. Because we pre-\nsume that Congress meant to incorporate the settled\nmeaning of actual malice when it incorporated the lan-\nguage of that standard, we hold that a statement other-\nwise eligible for ATSA immunity may not be denied\nimmunity unless the statement is materially false.\n  In New York Times, we held that under the First\nAmendment, a public official cannot recover “for a defama-\ntory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he\nproves that the statement was made with ‘actual malice’—\nthat is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless\ndisregard of whether it was false or not.” Id., at 279–\n280. Congress borrowed this exact language in denying\nATSA immunity to “(1) any disclosure made with actual\nknowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or\nmisleading; or (2) any disclosure made with reckless\ndisregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure.”\n§44941(b).\n8        AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   One could in principle construe the language of the\nactual malice standard to cover true statements made\nrecklessly. But we have long held, to the contrary, that\nactual malice entails falsity. See, e.g., Philadelphia News-\npapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U. S. 767, 775 (1986) (“[A]s one\nmight expect given the language of the Court in New York\nTimes, a public-figure plaintiff must show the falsity of the\nstatements at issue in order to prevail in a suit for defa-\nmation” (citation omitted)); Garrison v. Louisiana, 379\nU. S. 64, 74 (1964) (“We held in New York Times that a\npublic official might be allowed the civil remedy only if he\nestablishes that the utterance was false”).\n   Indeed, we have required more than mere falsity to\nestablish actual malice: The falsity must be “material.”\nMasson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 501 U. S. 496, 517\n(1991). As we explained in Masson, “[m]inor inaccuracies\ndo not amount to falsity so long as ‘the substance, the gist,\nthe sting, of the libelous charge be justified.’ ” Ibid. A\n“statement is not considered false unless it ‘would have a\ndifferent effect on the mind of the reader from that which\nthe pleaded truth would have produced.’ ” Ibid. (quoting\nR. Sack, Libel, Slander, and Related Problems 138 (1980)).\n   These holdings were settled when Congress enacted the\nATSA, and we therefore presume that Congress meant to\nadopt the material falsity requirement when it incorpo-\nrated the actual malice standard into the ATSA immunity\nexception. “[I]t is a cardinal rule of statutory construction\nthat, when Congress employs a term of art, it presumably\nknows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached\nto each borrowed word in the body of learning from which\nit is taken.” FAA v. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip\nop., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted). The actual\nmalice standard does not cover materially true statements\nmade recklessly, so we presume that Congress did not\nmean to deny ATSA immunity to such statements.\n   Other indicia of statutory meaning could rebut this\n                   Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)               9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\npresumption, but here, they do not. First, the ATSA’s\ntext favors a falsity requirement. The first subsection of\n§44941(b) requires falsity, as a true disclosure cannot have\nbeen made “with actual knowledge” that it “was false.”\nThe only question is whether the second subsection—\nwhich denies immunity to “any disclosure made with\nreckless disregard as to [its] truth or falsity”—similarly\nrequires falsity. We conclude that it does. The second\nsubsection simply extends the immunity exception from\nknowing falsehoods to reckless ones, ensuring that an air\ncarrier cannot avoid liability for a baseless report by stick-\ning its head in the sand to avoid “actual knowledge” that\nits statements are false. “[T]he defense of truth . . . , even\nif not explicitly recognized, . . .is implicit in . . . a standard\nof recovery that rests on knowing or reckless disregard of\nthe truth.” Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469,\n498–499 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring).\n   A material falsity requirement also serves the purpose\nof ATSA immunity. The ATSA shifted from airlines to the\nTSA the responsibility “for assessing and investigating\npossible threats to airline security.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">907764</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *14\n(Eid, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In\ndirecting the TSA to “receive, assess, and distribute intel-\nligence information related to transportation security,” 49\nU. S. C. §114(f)(1), Congress wanted to ensure that air\ncarriers and their employees would not hesitate to provide\nthe TSA with the information it needed. This is the pur-\npose of the immunity provision, evident both from its\ncontext and from the title of the statutory section that\ncontained it: “encouraging airline employees to report sus-\npicious activities.” ATSA §125, 115 Stat. 631 (capitali-\nzation and boldface type omitted). It would defeat this\npurpose to deny immunity for substantially true reports,\non the theory that the person making the report had not\nyet gathered enough information to be certain of its truth.\nSuch a rule would restore the pre-ATSA state of affairs, in\n10       AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich air carriers bore the responsibility to investigate\nand verify potential threats.\n    We therefore hold that ATSA immunity may not be\ndenied under §44941(b) to materially true statements.\nThis interpretation of the statute is clear enough that\nHoeper effectively concedes it. See Brief for Respondent\n30 (acknowledging that if the Colorado Supreme Court\nactually said “ ‘an airline may be denied ATSA immunity\n. . . for reporting true information,’ ” then “the court was\nlikely wrong”). Hoeper does point out in a footnote that\ngiven Congress’ desire to deny immunity to “ ‘bad actors,’ ”\nand “given that the vast majority of reckless statements\nwill not turn out to be true[,] . . . Congress could have\nquite reasonably chosen to deny the special privilege of\nATSA immunity to all reckless speakers,” even those\nwhose statements turned out to be true. Id., at 30, n. 12.\nBut although Congress could have made this choice, noth-\ning about the statute’s text or purpose suggests that it\nactually did. Instead, Congress chose to model the excep-\ntion to ATSA immunity after a standard we have long\nconstrued to require material falsity.\n                             B\n  We are not persuaded by Hoeper’s arguments that\nwe should affirm the judgment of the Colorado Supreme\nCourt notwithstanding its misapprehension of the ATSA\nimmunity standard.\n  Hoeper first argues that Air Wisconsin forfeited the\nclaim that it is entitled to immunity because its state-\nments were materially true. His premise is that Air\nWisconsin argued the truth of its statements only in chal-\nlenging the evidentiary basis for the defamation verdict, not\nin asserting immunity. But Air Wisconsin’s brief before\nthe Colorado Supreme Court argued that the exception to\nATSA immunity “appears to incorporate the New York\nTimes actual malice standard,” which—as we have ex-\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nplained—requires material falsity. Petitioner’s Opening\nBrief in No. 09SC1050, p. 24.\n   Hoeper next argues that the Colorado Supreme Court\nperformed the requisite analysis of material falsity, albeit\nin the context of finding the record sufficient to support\nthe jury’s defamation verdict. For several reasons, however,\nthis analysis does not suffice for us to affirm the denial\nof ATSA immunity. First, to the extent that the immunity\ndetermination belongs to the court—as the Colorado Su-\npreme Court held—a court’s deferential review of jury\nfindings cannot substitute for its own analysis of the\nrecord. Second, the jury here did not find that any falsity\nin Air Wisconsin’s statements was material, because the\ntrial court instructed it only to determine whether “[o]ne\nor more of th[e] statements was false,” App. 580, without\naddressing materiality. Third, applying the material\nfalsity standard to a defamation claim is quite different\nfrom applying it to ATSA immunity. In both contexts,\na materially false statement is one that “ ‘would have a\ndifferent effect on the mind of the reader [or listener] from\nthat which the . . . truth would have produced.’ ” Masson,\n501 U. S., at 517. But the identity of the relevant reader\nor listener varies according to the context. In determining\nwhether a falsehood is material to a defamation claim, we\ncare whether it affects the subject’s reputation in the\ncommunity. In the context of determining ATSA immu-\nnity, by contrast, we care whether a falsehood affects the\nauthorities’ perception of and response to a given threat.3\n——————\n  3 These are very different inquiries. Suppose the TSA receives the\nfollowing tip: “My adulterous husband is carrying a gun onto a flight.”\nWhether the husband is adulterous will presumably have no effect on\nthe TSA’s assessment of any security risk that he poses. So if the word\n“adulterous” is false, the caller may still be entitled to ATSA immunity.\nBut any falsity as to that word obviously would affect the husband’s\nreputation in the community, so it would be material in the context of a\ndefamation claim.\n12         AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                           III\n  Finally, the Colorado Supreme Court’s analysis of mate-\nrial falsity was erroneous. We turn next to explaining\nwhy, by applying the ATSA immunity standard to the\nfacts of this case.4\n                                A\n   We begin by addressing how to determine the material-\nity of a false statement in the ATSA context. As we noted\nearlier, a materially false statement is generally one that\n“ ‘would have a different effect on the mind of the reader\n[or listener] from that which the . . . truth would have\nproduced.’ ” Ibid. The parties quibble over whether ATSA\nimmunity requires some special version of this standard,\nbut they more or less agree—as do we—that the usual\nstandard suffices as long as the hypothetical reader or\nlistener is a security officer.\n   A further question is what it means for a statement to\nproduce “ ‘a different effect on the mind of ’ ” a security\nofficer from that which the truth would have produced. In\ndefamation law, the reputational harm caused by a false\nstatement is its effect on a reader’s or listener’s mind. But\ncontrary to the position of Hoeper’s counsel at oral argu-\nment, Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–33, courts cannot decide whether\na false statement produced “ ‘a different effect on the mind\nof ’ ” a hypothetical TSA officer without considering the\neffect of that statement on TSA’s behavior. After all, the\n\n——————\n  4 We “recognize the prudence . . . of allowing the lower courts ‘to un-\n\ndertake [a fact-intensive inquiry] in the first instance.’ ” Holland v.\nFlorida, 560 U. S. 631, 654 (2010). Here, however, we conclude that\nanother prudential consideration—the need for clear guidance on a\nnovel but important question of federal law—weighs in favor of our\napplying the ATSA immunity standard. Cf. Bose Corp. v. Consumers\nUnion of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 503 (1984) (“[T]his Court’s\nrole in marking out the limits of [a First Amendment] standard through\nthe process of case-by-case adjudication is of special importance”).\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhole reason the TSA considers threat reports is to deter-\nmine and execute a response.\n   A plaintiff seeking to defeat ATSA immunity need not\nshow “precisely what a particular official or federal agency\nwould have done in a counterfactual scenario.” Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 27. Such a showing\nwould be “impossible . . . given the need to maintain se-\ncrecy regarding airline security operations.” Brief for Re-\nspondent 42. But any falsehood cannot be material, for\npurposes of ATSA immunity, absent a substantial likeli-\nhood that a reasonable security officer would consider it\nimportant in determining a response to the supposed\nthreat. Cf. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426\nU. S. 438, 449 (1976) (an omission in a proxy solicitation\n“is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a\nreasonable shareholder would consider it important in\ndeciding how to vote”). This standard “is an objective\none, involving the [hypothetical] significance of an omitted\nor misrepresented fact to a reasonable” security official,\nrather than the actual significance of that fact to a partic-\nular security official. Id., at 445.\n                               B\n   We apply the material falsity standard to the facts of\nthis case. In doing so, we neither embrace nor reject the\nColorado Supreme Court’s unanimous holding “that im-\nmunity under the ATSA is a question of law to be deter-\nmined by the trial court before trial.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9097764</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n*4; see id., at *11 (Eid, J., concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part) (agreeing with majority). Rather, we conclude\nthat even if a jury were to find the historical facts in the\nmanner most favorable to Hoeper, Air Wisconsin is enti-\ntled to ATSA immunity as a matter of law.\n   We begin with Air Wisconsin’s statement that Hoeper\n“was an FFDO who may be armed.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n111a. Hoeper cannot dispute the literal truth of this\n14         AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstatement: He was an FFDO, and because FFDOs possess\nweapons, any FFDO “may be armed.” Hoeper argues only\nthat to avoid any misinterpretation, Air Wisconsin should\nhave qualified the statement by adding that it had no\nreason to think he was actually carrying his gun during\nthe trip to Virginia, especially because he was not allowed\nto do so under §44921(f )(1).5 We agree that Air Wiscon-\nsin’s statement could have been misinterpreted by some,\nbut we reject Hoeper’s argument for two reasons. First,\nany confusion of the nature that Hoeper suggests would\nhave been immaterial: A reasonable TSA officer, having\nbeen told only that Hoeper was an FFDO and that he was\nupset about losing his job, would have wanted to investi-\ngate whether Hoeper was carrying his gun. Second, to\naccept Hoeper’s demand for such precise wording would\nvitiate the purpose of ATSA immunity: to encourage air\ncarriers and their employees, often in fast-moving situa-\ntions and with little time to fine-tune their diction, to\nprovide the TSA immediately with information about\npotential threats. Baggage handlers, flight attendants,\ngate agents, and other airline employees who report suspi-\ncious behavior to the TSA should not face financial ruin if,\nin the heat of a potential threat, they fail to choose their\nwords with exacting care.6\n——————\n   5 See Tr. of Oral Arg. 42–43 (concession by Hoeper’s counsel that “it\n\nwould have been true for [Air Wisconsin] to say, look, we’re calling to\nlet you know, because Mr. Hoeper’s an FFDO, we don’t have any reason\nto believe that he has gun with him, but we can’t tell for sure, so we\njust thought we would tell you, in case you have any questions and\nwant to investigate further”).\n   While we take the jury’s findings at face value, we note that the\nrecord suggests Air Wisconsin may well have added the qualifier that\nHoeper argues was necessary. An internal TSA e-mail summarizing\nDoyle’s call concludes by stating: “[Redacted] does not believe [redacted]\nis in possession of a firearm at this time.” App. 414.\n   6 Hoeper also takes issue with Air Wisconsin’s statement that it was\n\n“concerned about . . . the whereabouts of his firearm,” App. to Pet. for\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  We next consider Air Wisconsin’s statement that Hoeper\n“was terminated today.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a.\nWhen Air Wisconsin made that statement, Hoeper had not\nyet been fired. But everyone knew the firing was almost\ncertainly imminent. Hoeper acknowledged that his em-\nployment was “at [Air Wisconsin’s] discretion” after his\nthird failed test, App. 193, and the agreement between\nhim and Air Wisconsin stated that his “fourth . . . attempt”\nto pass the test would be his “final” one, id., at 426. No\nreasonable TSA officer would care whether an angry, po-\ntentially armed airline employee had just been fired or\nmerely knew he was about to meet that fate.\n  Finally, we consider Air Wisconsin’s statements that\nHoeper was “[u]nstable” and that it was “concerned about\nhis mental stability.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a. Al-\nthough the details of Hoeper’s behavior during the simula-\ntor session may be disputed, Hoeper himself testified that\nhe had become visibly angry: He decided “that’s it,” he\nremoved his headset and “toss[ed] it,” and he accused the\ninstructor—at an “elevated decibel level,” and with an\nexpletive—of “railroading the situation.” App. 203–204. It\nwould surely have been correct, then, for Air Wisconsin to\nreport that Hoeper “ ‘blew up’ ” during the test. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">907764</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *8. The question is whether, from the perspective\nof a reasonable security officer, there is any material\ndifference between a statement that Hoeper had just “blown\nup” in a professional setting and a statement that he\nwas “[u]nstable.” We think not.\n  We are no more troubled by Air Wisconsin’s related\nstatement that it was “concerned about [Hoeper’s] mental\nstability.” Hoeper is correct that many of the Air Wiscon-\nsin officials who attended the meeting at headquarters\n—————— \n\nCert. 111a. But his arguments concerning this statement are the same\n\nas those concerning the statement that he “may [have] been armed,”\n\nibid., and we reject them for the same reasons. \n\n16       AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmight not have framed their concerns in terms of “men-\ntal stability.” LaWare, for instance, testified that “[t]hose\nweren’t the words that [he] would have anticipated” when\nhe directed Doyle to call the TSA. App. 272. But the\nofficials who attended the meeting did harbor concerns\nabout Hoeper’s mental state: They knew he had just\n“blown up,” and they worried about what he might do\nnext. It would be inconsistent with the ATSA’s text and\npurpose to expose Air Wisconsin to liability because its\nemployee could have chosen a slightly better phrase than\n“mental stability” to articulate its concern. Just as\n“[m]inor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity” in the\ndefamation context, “so long as ‘the substance, the gist,\nthe sting, of the libelous charge be justified,’ ” Masson, 501\nU. S., at 517, a statement that would otherwise qualify for\nATSA immunity cannot lose that immunity because of\nsome minor imprecision, so long as “the gist” of the state-\nment is accurate. Doyle’s statements to the TSA accu-\nrately conveyed “the gist” of the situation; it is irrelevant\nwhether trained lawyers or judges might with the luxury\nof time have chosen more precise words.\n   Hoeper’s overarching factual theory appears to be that\nmembers of the BAe-146 team, including Doyle and Schuer-\nman, harbored personal animosity toward him, which\ncaused them to manipulate the proficiency tests in order\nto fail him. But even if Hoeper were correct about\nall this (and we express no view on that question), we do\nnot see why it would have made him any less a threat in\nthe eyes of a reasonable security officer. As between two\nemployees—one who thinks he is being fired because of his\ninadequate skills, another who thinks he is being fired\nbecause his employer hates him—the latter is presumably\nmore, not less, likely to lash out in anger.\n   The partial dissent argues that Doyle’s reference to\nHoeper’s “mental stability” was so egregious as to make\nhis report to the TSA the basis of a $1.2 million defama-\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion judgment. We disagree. While lawyers and judges\nmay in some contexts apply the label “mentally unstable”\nto people suffering from serious mental illnesses, see post,\nat 4 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part),\nthat is hardly the only manner in which the label is used.\nA holding that Air Wisconsin lost its ATSA immunity by\nvirtue of Doyle’s failure to be aware of every connotation of\nthe phrase “mental stability” would eviscerate the immun-\nity provision. All of us from time to time use words that,\non reflection, we might modify. If such slips of the tongue\ncould give rise to major financial liability, no airline would\ncontact the TSA (or permit its employees to do so) without\nrunning by its lawyers the text of its proposed disclosure—\nexactly the kind of hesitation that Congress aimed to\navoid.\n   The partial dissent further argues that Hoeper’s “dis-\nplay of anger” made him no more a threat than “millions\nof perfectly harmless air travelers.” Post, at 4. But\nHoeper did not just lose his temper; he lost it in circum-\nstances that he knew would lead to his firing, which he\nregarded as the culmination of a vendetta against him.\nAnd he was not just any passenger; he was an FFDO,\nwhich meant that he could plausibly have been carrying a\nfirearm. In short, Hoeper was not some traveling busi-\nnessman who yelled at a barista in a fit of pique over a\nbadly brewed cup of coffee.\n   Finally, the partial dissent relies on an expert’s testi-\nmony “that Hoeper’s behavior did not warrant any report\nto the TSA.” Post, at 4 (citing App. 356). But the expert\nappears to have based that statement on an outdated\nunderstanding of reporting obligations that is flatly at\nodds with the ATSA. Prior to the ATSA, “airlines were\nresponsible for assessing and investigating possible\nthreats to airline security.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">907764</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *14 (Eid, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). But the ATSA\nshifted that responsibility to the TSA, creating a policy\n18       AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“known as ‘when in doubt, report.’ ” Ibid.; see supra, at 9.\nThe expert who believed that Hoeper’s conduct did not\nwarrant a report to the TSA also believed that airlines\nhave “an obligation . . . to filter out . . . the low noise from\n. . . what’s significant” in reporting threats. App. 356.\nThat understanding does not comport with the policy that\nCongress chose to enact.\n    The Colorado Supreme Court recognized that even if the\nfacts are viewed in the light most favorable to Hoeper, Air\nWisconsin “would likely be immune” had it “reported that\nHoeper . . . knew he would be terminated soon, that he\nhad acted irrationally at the training three hours earlier\nand ‘blew up’ at test administrators, and that he was an\nFFDO pilot.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">907764</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *8. But the court erred in\nparsing so finely the distinctions between these hypothet-\nical statements and the ones that Air Wisconsin actually\nmade. The minor differences are, for the reasons we have\nexplained, immaterial as a matter of law in determining\nAir Wisconsin’s ATSA immunity.\n    By incorporating the actual malice standard into\n§44941(b), Congress meant to give air carriers the\n“ ‘breathing space’ ” to report potential threats to security\nofficials without fear of civil liability for a few inaptly\nchosen words. New York Times, 376 U. S., at 272. To hold\nAir Wisconsin liable for minor misstatements or loose\nwording would undermine that purpose and disregard the\nstatutory text.\n                        *    *     *\n  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado is\ntherefore reversed, and the case is remanded for proceed-\nings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

S. C. §44901\net seq., an airline may not be denied immunity for a re-\nport it made to the Transportation Security Administration\n(TSA) absent a finding that the report was materially\nfalse. I also agree that, in this context, materiality means\nthat the falsehood had a natural tendency to influence a\nreasonable TSA officer’s determination of an appropriate\nresponse to the report; and that neither the jury nor the\ncourts below considered material falsity in this ATSA-\nspecific way. I therefore join Parts I, II, and III–A of the\nCourt’s opinion.\n   Having answered the question we granted certiorari to\ndecide, see 570 U. S. ___ (2013), I would stop there and\nremand the case for further proceedings. Instead, the\nCourt proceeds to “apply the [ATSA] material falsity\nstandard to the facts of this case” in the first instance,\nante, at 13, and concludes as a matter of law that Air\nWisconsin’s report to the TSA about William Hoeper was\nnot materially false. In so holding, the Court in my view\nreaches out to decide a factbound question better left to\nthe lower courts, and then proceeds to give the wrong\n2        AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v.

Masson v. New Yorker Magazine,\nInc., 501 U. S. 496, 522 (1991). That makes sense, since\nmateriality is the sort of “ ‘mixed question of law and fact’ ”\nthat “has typically been resolved by juries.” United States\nv. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 512 (1995). The jury has a vital\nrole to play in the materiality inquiry, which entails “ ‘deli-\ncate assessments of the inferences a “reasonable deci-\nsionmaker” would draw from a given set of facts and the\nsignificance of those inferences to him’ ” and is therefore\n“ ‘peculiarly one for the trier of fact.’ ” Ibid. (quoting TSC\nIndustries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 450\n(1976); brackets omitted). Such a question cannot be\nwithdrawn from the jury unless “the facts and the law will\nreasonably support only one conclusion” on which “reason-\nable persons . . . could [not] differ.” McDermott Int’l, Inc.\nv. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337, 356 (1991). The same rule\napplies to a determination of immunity from suit: When a\ndefendant raises qualified immunity on summary judg-\nment, the court must “adop[t] . . . the plaintiff ’s version\nof the facts” unless “no reasonable jury could believe it.”\nScott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 378–380 (2007).\n   Therefore, if we are to apply the ATSA materiality\nstandard to the complex record in this case in the first\ninstance, it is proper to view “the historical facts in the\nmanner most favorable to Hoeper,” as the Court purports\nto do. Ante, at 13. We must of course begin by taking as\ngiven the findings that we know the jury already made,\nincluding that Air Wisconsin told the TSA that the airline\nwas “concerned about [Hoeper’s] mental stability” and that\nhe was an “[u]nstable pilot,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a\n(special verdict form), and that those statements were\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nfalse, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">907764</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *10 (Colo., Mar. 19, 2012). Next,\nwe must ask whether a reasonable jury could find the\nremaining historical facts to be such that those statements\nwere not only false, but materially false from the perspec-\ntive of a reasonable TSA agent. If not, judgment for Air\nWisconsin is proper; but if so, the ATSA materiality ques-\ntion should be tried to a (properly instructed) jury. (Un-\nless, of course, a reasonable jury would be compelled to\nfind facts that would render the statements materially\nfalse, in which case judgment for Hoeper would be proper;\nbut that is assuredly not the case here.)\n   Applying that reasonable-jury standard, I do not see\nhow we can possibly hold as a matter of law that Air\nWisconsin’s report was not materially false. The Court\nacknowledges Hoeper’s description of the confrontation\nthat spawned the airline’s threat report: After failing\na flight simulator test, Hoeper “decided ‘that’s it,’ he\nremoved his headset and ‘toss[ed] it,’ and he accused\nthe instructor—at an ‘elevated decibel level,’ and with\nan expletive—of ‘railroading the situation.’ ” Ante, at 15\n(quoting App. 203–204). A jury could credit Hoeper’s\naccount. It could also believe his “overarching factual\ntheory” that his anger was reasonable because the instruc-\ntor had “manipulate[d]” the test to cause him to fail out of\n“personal animosity,” ante, at 16—a theory that was not\nwithout supporting evidence, see, e.g., App. 259–260 (pilot\ntestifying as expert witness that Hoeper’s testing was\n“absolutely unfair” and “biased”). Moreover, there was\nevidence from which a jury could conclude that no one who\ninteracted with Hoeper during or after the confrontation—\nincluding the instructor—viewed him as either unstable or\nthreatening. See, e.g., id., at 15–16 (instructor acknowl-\nedging that he “ ‘quickly realized it wasn’t a threatening\nsituation’ ”); id., at 29–31 (instructor testifying he “ ‘never\nfelt that [Hoeper] was going to go do something stupid,’ ”\n“ ‘didn’t believe that Mr. Hoeper posed a threat in any way\n4         AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                        Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nto anybody else at all,’ ” “ ‘did not believe that Mr. Hoeper\nwas engaging in irrational behavior,’ ” and “ ‘deem[ed] him\nperfectly safe to get on an airplane’ ”); id., at 462 (airline\nrepresentative who gave Hoeper permission to fly home\ntestifying he “had no concern that [Hoeper] was a physical\nthreat to anybody” and “didn’t believe he was mentally\nunstable”).\n  In short, a jury could find that Hoeper did nothing more\nthan engage in a brief, run-of-the-mill, and arguably\njustified display of anger that included raising his voice\nand swearing, but that did not cause anyone, including the\nperson on the receiving end of the outburst, to view him as\neither irrational or a potential source of violence. Viewing\nthe facts in that light, I cannot agree with the Court that\na reasonable TSA official would not “consider . . . im-\nportant,” ante, at 13, the difference between an individual\nwho engaged in this sort of heated but commonplace dis-\nplay of anger, on the one hand, and on the other, an\nindividual whose colleagues regard him as “mentally unsta-\nble.” It is the difference between a category that no doubt\nincludes millions of perfectly harmless air travelers and\none that, in ordinary parlance, connotes an alarming\ndegree of unpredictability and aggressiveness. Indeed, we\nhave used that term in connection with individuals so\n“dangerously mentally ill” that they may be subject to civil\nconfinement. Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 363\n(1997). The importance of that difference was highlighted\nby the expert testimony in this case of a former TSA Fed-\neral Security Director, who stated—based on a version of\nthe underlying facts the jury was entitled to accept—that\nHoeper’s behavior did not warrant any report to the TSA.\nApp. 356.*\n——————\n  * The Court dismisses the former Director’s testimony because he\ntestified that in making threat reports to the TSA, airline officials\nshould use “common sense” to “filter out the garbage and report [only]\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                      5\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n  The association with dangerous mental illness is not, as\nthe Court suggests, merely one “connotation of the phrase\n‘mental [in]stability’ ” among many, ante, at 17; it is the\neveryday understanding of that phrase. The Court says\nthat this is “hardly the only manner in which the label is\nused,” ibid., but it does not even attempt to describe an-\nother usage, let alone one that would be a materially\naccurate description of the facts of this case as a jury\nmight find them. The Court also suggests that the cir-\ncumstances of this case—particularly the fact that Hoeper\nknew his firing was imminent, had reason to be angry\nwith the airline, and was authorized to carry a firearm—\ndistinguish Hoeper’s confrontation with the instructor\nfrom an ordinary “fit of pique.” Ibid. But if so, it was all\nthe more important for the airline to make an accurate\nreport to the TSA, so that the agency could assess the\npossible danger and determine an appropriate response.\nFalsely reporting to the TSA that a young Irishman is an\nIRA terrorist is much more likely to produce a prompt\nand erroneous response than reporting that a 70-year-old\nEnglish grandmother is. The circumstances the Court\nidentifies enhanced, rather than diminished, the likeli-\nhood that the false “mentally unstable” designation would\nhave a material effect on the TSA’s response.\n  In sum, it is simply implausible that, taking the facts of\n——————\nreally suspicious incidents,” App. 356, a view the Court deems “flatly at\nodds with the ATSA,” ante, at 17. The ATSA, however, simply requires\nairlines to report “threat[s] to civil aviation,” 49 U. S. C. §44905(a). The\nstatute surely places a heavy thumb on the scale in favor of reporting,\nbut it certainly does not preclude the exercise of reasonable judgment\nin deciding what rises to the level of a “threat” and what constitutes, as\nthe former Director put it, irrelevant “garbage.” And even if one\ndisagrees with the former Director that no report should have been\nmade at all, the point is that a reasonable jury could have considered\nhis testimony relevant to establishing that falsely expressing concerns\nabout an individual’s “mental stability” in the circumstances of this\ncase would have a material effect on the TSA’s decisionmaking process.\n6        AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                    Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthis case in the light most favorable to Hoeper, a reason-\nable jury would have to find that the report of mental in-\nstability would have no effect upon the course of action\ndetermined by the TSA. The Court’s holding to the con-\ntrary demonstrates the wisdom of preserving the jury’s\nrole in this inquiry, designed to inject a practical sense\nthat judges sometimes lack. I respectfully dissent from\nthat holding.\n</pre>", "id": 2654278, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/01/27/air_wisconsin_airlines_corp._v._hoeper_1.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

HOEPER\n\n      CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF COLORADO\n\n  No. 12–315.      Argued December 9, 2013—Decided January 27, 2014\nRespondent Hoeper was a pilot for petitioner Air Wisconsin Airlines\n  Corp. When Air Wisconsin stopped flying from Hoeper’s home base\n  on aircraft that he was certified to fly, he needed to become certified\n  on a different type of aircraft to keep his job. After Hoeper failed in\n  his first three attempts to gain certification, Air Wisconsin agreed to\n  give him a fourth and final chance. But he performed poorly during a\n  required training session in a simulator. Hoeper responded angrily\n  to this failure—raising his voice, tossing his headset, using profanity,\n  and accusing the instructor of “railroading the situation.”\n     The instructor called an Air Wisconsin manager, who booked\n  Hoeper on a flight from the test location to Hoeper’s home in Denver.\n  Several hours later, the manager discussed Hoeper’s behavior with\n  other airline officials. The officials discussed Hoeper’s outburst, his\n  impending termination, the history of assaults by disgruntled airline\n  employees, and the chance that—because Hoeper was a Federal\n  Flight Deck Officer (FFDO), permitted “to carry a firearm while en-\n  gaged in providing air transportation,” 49 U. S. C. §44921(f)(1)—he\n  might be armed. At the end of the meeting, an airline executive\n  made the decision to notify the Transportation Security Administra-\n  tion (TSA) of the situation. The manager who had received the initial\n  report from Hoeper’s instructor made the call to the TSA. During\n  that call, according to the jury, he made two statements: first, that\n  Hoeper “was an FFDO who may be armed” and that the airline was\n  “concerned about his mental stability and the whereabouts of his\n  firearm”; and second, that an “[u]nstable pilot in [the] FFDO program\n  was terminated today.” In response, the TSA removed Hoeper from\n  his plane, searched him, and questioned him about the location of his\n  gun. Hoeper eventually boarded a later flight to Denver, and Air\n  Wisconsin fired him the next day.\n2            AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       Hoeper sued for defamation in Colorado state court. Air Wisconsin\n    moved for summary judgment and later for a directed verdict, relying\n    on the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which\n    grants airlines and their employees immunity against civil liability\n    for reporting suspicious behavior, 49 U. S. C. §44941(a), except where\n    such disclosure is “made with actual knowledge that the disclosure\n    was false, inaccurate, or misleading” or “made with reckless disre-\n    gard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure,” §44941(b). The trial\n    court denied the motions and submitted the ATSA immunity ques-\n    tion to the jury. The jury found for Hoeper on the defamation claim.\n    The State Supreme Court affirmed. It held that the trial court erred\n    in submitting the immunity question to the jury but that the error\n    was harmless. Laboring under the assumption that even true state-\n    ments do not qualify for ATSA immunity if they are made recklessly,\n    the court held that Air Wisconsin was not entitled to immunity be-\n    cause its statements to the TSA were made with reckless disregard of\n    their truth or falsity.\nHeld:\n    1. ATSA immunity may not be denied to materially true state-\n ments. Pp. 7–11.\n       (a) The ATSA immunity exception is patterned after the actual\n malice standard of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254,\n which requires material falsity. See, e.g., Masson v. New Yorker\n Magazine, Inc., 501 U. S. 496, 517. Because the material falsity re-\n quirement was settled when the ATSA was enacted, Congress pre-\n sumably meant to incorporate it into the ATSA’s immunity exception\n and did not mean to deny ATSA immunity to true statements made\n recklessly. This presumption is not rebutted by other indicia of stat-\n utory meaning. Section 44941(b)(1) requires falsity, and §44941(b)(2)\n simply extends the immunity exception from knowing falsehoods to\n reckless ones. Denying immunity for substantially true reports, on\n the theory that the person making the report had not yet gathered\n enough information to be certain of its truth, would defeat the pur-\n pose of ATSA immunity: to ensure that air carriers and their employ-\n ees do not hesitate to provide the TSA with needed information.\n Pp. 7–10.\n       (b) Hoeper’s arguments that the State Supreme Court’s judgment\n should be affirmed notwithstanding its misapprehension of ATSA’s\n immunity standard are unpersuasive. Hoeper claims that Air Wis-\n consin did not argue the truth of its statements in asserting immuni-\n ty, but Air Wisconsin contended in the state court that ATSA’s im-\n munity exception incorporates the New York Times actual malice\n standard, which requires material falsity. And the State Supreme\n Court did not perform the requisite analysis of material falsity in\n                   Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nfinding the record sufficient to support the defamation verdict. A\ncourt’s deferential review of jury findings cannot substitute for its\nown analysis of the record; the jury was instructed only to determine\nfalsity, not materiality; and applying the material falsity standard to\na defamation claim is quite different from applying it to ATSA im-\nmunity. Pp. 10–11.\n   2. Under the correct material falsity analysis, Air Wisconsin is en-\ntitled to immunity as a matter of law. Pp. 12–18.\n      (a) In the defamation context, a materially false statement is one\nthat “ ‘would have a different effect on the mind of the reader [or lis-\ntener] from that which the . . . truth would have produced.’ ” Masson,\n501 U. S., at 517. This standard suffices in the ATSA context as well,\nso long as the hypothetical reader or listener is a security officer. For\npurposes of ATSA immunity, a falsehood cannot be material absent a\nsubstantial likelihood that a reasonable security officer would consid-\ner it important in determining a response to the supposed threat.\nPp. 12–13.\n      (b) Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hoeper,\nthe Court concludes as a matter of law that any falsehoods in Air\nWisconsin’s statement to the TSA were not material. First, the Court\nrejects Hoeper’s argument that Air Wisconsin should have qualified\nits statement that Hoeper “was an FFDO who may be armed” by not-\ning that it had no reason to think he actually was armed. To the ex-\ntent that Air Wisconsin’s statement could have been confusing, any\nsuch confusion is immaterial, as a reasonable TSA officer—having\nbeen told that Hoeper was an FFDO who was upset about losing his\njob—would have wanted to investigate whether he was armed. To\ndemand more precise wording would vitiate the purpose of ATSA\nimmunity: to encourage air carriers and their employees, often in\nfast-moving situations and with little time to fine-tune their diction,\nto provide the TSA immediately with information about potential\nthreats. Second, Air Wisconsin’s statement that Hoeper “was termi-\nnated today” was not materially false. While Hoeper had not actually\nbeen fired at the time of the statement, everyone involved knew that\nhis firing was imminent. No reasonable TSA officer would care\nwhether an angry, potentially armed airline employee had just been\nfired or merely knew he was about to meet that fate. Finally, alt-\nhough the details of Hoeper’s behavior during the simulator session\nmay be disputed, it would have been correct even under Hoeper’s ver-\nsion of the facts for Air Wisconsin to report that Hoeper “blew up”\nduring the test. From a reasonable security officer’s perspective,\nthere is no material difference between a statement that Hoeper had\n“blown up” in a professional setting and a statement that he was un-\nstable. Air Wisconsin’s related statement that it was “concerned\n4           AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    about [Hoeper’s] mental stability” is no more troubling. Many of the\n    officials who attended the meeting at airline headquarters might not\n    have framed their concerns in terms of “mental stability,” but it\n    would be inconsistent with the ATSA’s text and purpose to expose Air\n    Wisconsin to liability because the manager who placed the call to the\n    TSA could have chosen a slightly better phrase to articulate the air-\n    line’s concern. A statement that would otherwise qualify for ATSA\n    immunity cannot lose that immunity because of some minor impreci-\n    sion, so long as “the gist” of the statement is accurate, Masson, 501\n    U.

Aviation and Transportation Security Act\n(ATSA), 49 U. S. C. §44901 et seq. To ensure that the\nTSA would be informed of potential threats, Congress gave\nairlines and their employees immunity against civil liabil-\nity for reporting suspicious behavior. §44941(a). But this\nimmunity does not attach to “any disclosure made with\nactual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate,\nor misleading” or “any disclosure made with reckless\ndisregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure.”\n§44941(b).\n   The question before us is whether ATSA immunity may\nbe denied under §44941(b) without a determination that a\ndisclosure was materially false. We hold that it may not.\nBecause the state courts made no such determination, and\nbecause any falsehood in the disclosure here would not\nhave affected a reasonable security officer’s assessment of\nthe supposed threat, we reverse the judgment of the Colo-\nrado Supreme Court.\n2        AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   William Hoeper joined Air Wisconsin Airlines Corpora-\ntion as a pilot in 1998. But by late 2004, Air Wisconsin\nhad stopped operating flights from Denver, Hoeper’s home\nbase, on any type of aircraft for which he was certified. To\ncontinue flying for Air Wisconsin out of Denver, Hoeper\nneeded to gain certification on the British Aerospace 146\n(BAe-146), an aircraft he had not flown.\n   Hoeper failed in his first three attempts to pass a profi-\nciency test. After the third failure, as he later acknowl-\nedged at trial, his employment was “at [Air Wisconsin’s]\ndiscretion.” App. 193. But he and Air Wisconsin entered\ninto an agreement to afford him “one more opportunity to\npass [the] proficiency check.” Id., at 426. The agreement\nleft little doubt that Hoeper would lose his job if he failed\nagain.\n   In December 2004, Hoeper flew from Denver to Virginia\nfor simulator training as part of this final test. During the\ntraining, Hoeper failed to cope with a challenging scenario\ncreated by the instructor, Mark Schuerman, and the simu-\nlator showed the engines “flam[ing] out” due to a loss of\nfuel. App. 203. As Schuerman began to tell Hoeper that\nhe “should know better,” ibid., Hoeper responded angrily.\nHe later described what happened:\n    “At this point, that’s it. I take my headset off and I\n    toss it up on the glare shield. . . . [Schuerman] and I\n    exchanged words at the same elevated decibel level.\n    Mine went something like this: This is a bunch of shit.\n    I’m sorry. You are railroading the situation and it’s\n    not realistic.” Id., at 203–204.\nWhen Hoeper announced that he wanted to call the legal\ndepartment of the pilots’ union, Schuerman ended the\nsession so that Hoeper could do so. Schuerman then re-\nported Hoeper’s behavior to Patrick Doyle, the Wisconsin-\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbased manager of the BAe-146 fleet. Doyle booked Hoeper\non a United Airlines flight back to Denver.\n   Several hours after Schuerman’s report, Doyle discussed\nthe situation at Air Wisconsin’s headquarters with the\nairline’s Vice President of Operations, Kevin LaWare; its\nManaging Director of Flight Operations, Scott Orozco; and\nits Assistant Chief Pilot, Robert Frisch. LaWare later ex-\nplained the accretion of his concerns about what Hoeper\nmight do next. He regarded Hoeper’s behavior in the\nsimulator as “a fairly significant outburst,” of a sort that\nhe “hadn’t seen . . . before.” Id., at 276. And he knew “it\nwas a given that . . . Hoeper’s employment was . . . going\nto be terminated” as a result of his failure to complete the\nsimulator training. Id., at 278.\n   Then, LaWare testified, Orozco mentioned that Hoeper\nwas a Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO). The FFDO\nprogram allows the Government to “deputize volunteer\npilots of air carriers . . . to defend the flight decks of air-\ncraft . . . against acts of criminal violence or air piracy.”\n§44921(a). FFDOs are permitted “to carry a firearm while\nengaged in providing air transportation.” §44921(f )(1).\nHoeper had become an FFDO earlier in 2004 and had been\nissued a firearm. He was not allowed to carry the firearm\nduring his trip to the training facility, because he was not\n“engaged in providing air transportation,” ibid. But ac-\ncording to one official at the meeting, the Denver airport’s\nsecurity procedures made it possible for crew members to\nbypass screening, so that Hoeper could have carried his\ngun despite the rule. Indeed, Frisch later testified that he\nwas “aware of one” incident in which an Air Wisconsin\npilot had come to training with his FFDO weapon. App.\n292. On the basis of this information, LaWare concluded,\nthere was “no way . . . to confirm” whether “Hoeper had\nhis weapon with him, even though . . . by policy, [he was]\nnot supposed to have it with him.” Id., at 279.\n   Finally, LaWare testified, he and the other Air Wiscon-\n4        AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsin officials discussed two prior episodes in which disgrun-\ntled airline employees had lashed out violently. Id., at\n280. In one incident, a FedEx flight engineer under inves-\ntigation for misconduct “entered the cockpit” of a FedEx\nflight “and began attacking the crew with a hammer”\nbefore being subdued. United States v. Calloway, 116\nF. 3d 1129, 1131 (CA6 1997). In another, a recently fired\nticket agent brought a gun onto a Pacific Southwest Air-\nlines flight and shot his former supervisor and the crew,\nleading to a fatal crash. Malnic, Report Confirms That\nGunman Caused 1987 Crash of PSA Jet, L. A. Times,\nJan. 6, 1989, p. 29.\n   In light of all this—Hoeper’s anger, his impending ter-\nmination, the chance that he might be armed, and the\nhistory of assaults by disgruntled airline employees—\nLaWare decided that the airline “need[ed] to make a call\nto the TSA,” to let the authorities know “the status” of the\nsituation. App. 282.\n   Doyle offered to make the call. According to the jury, he\nmade two statements to the TSA: first, that Hoeper “was\nan FFDO who may be armed” and that the airline was\n“concerned about his mental stability and the whereabouts\nof his firearm”; and second, that an “[u]nstable pilot in\n[the] FFDO program was terminated today.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 111a. (The latter statement appears in the rec-\nord as the subject line of an internal TSA e-mail, summa-\nrizing the call from Doyle. App. 414.)\n   The TSA responded to the call by ordering that Hoeper’s\nplane return to the gate. Officers boarded the plane, re-\nmoved Hoeper, searched him, and questioned him about\nthe location of his gun. When Hoeper stated that the gun\nwas at his home in Denver, a Denver-based federal agent\nwent there to retrieve it.\n   Later that day, Hoeper boarded a return flight to Den-\nver. Air Wisconsin fired him the following day.\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

The\ncase went to trial, and the court denied Air Wisconsin’s\nmotion for a directed verdict on the same basis. It submit-\nted the question of ATSA immunity to the jury, with the\ninstruction—following the language of §44941(b)—that\nimmunity would not apply if Hoeper had proved that\nAir Wisconsin “made the disclosure [to the TSA] with ac-\ntual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or\nmisleading” or “with reckless disregard as to its truth or\nfalsity.” App. 582. The jury instructions did not state that\nATSA immunity protects materially true statements.\n  The jury found for Hoeper on the defamation claim and\nawarded him $849,625 in compensatory damages and\n$391,875 in punitive damages. The court reduced the\nlatter award to $350,000, for a total judgment of just\nunder $1.2 million, plus costs.\n  The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed. 232 P. 3d 230\n(2009). It held “that the trial court properly submitted the\nATSA immunity issue to the jury,” that “the record sup-\n——————\n  1 Air Wisconsin agrees that it bears responsibility for Doyle’s state-\n\nments. 2012 WL 907764, *2, *16, n. 2 (Colo., Mar. 19, 2012).\n  2 The ATSA immunity provision specifies that “[a]ny air carrier . . . or\n\nany employee of an air carrier . . . who makes a voluntary disclosure\nof any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or\nregulation, relating to air piracy, a threat to aircraft or passenger\nsafety, or terrorism, . . . to any employee or agent of the Department of\nTransportation, the Department of Justice, any Federal, State, or local\nlaw enforcement officer, or any airport or airline security officer shall\nnot be civilly liable to any person under any law or regulation of the\nUnited States, any constitution, law, or regulation of any State or\npolitical subdivision of any State, for such disclosure.” 49 U.

HOEPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nports the jury’s rejection of immunity,” and that the evi-\ndence was sufficient to support the jury’s defamation\nverdict. Id., at 233.\n   The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed.             2012 WL\n907764 (Mar. 19, 2012). It began by holding, contrary to\nthe lower courts, “that immunity under the ATSA is a\nquestion of law to be determined by the trial court before\ntrial.” Id., at *4. But it concluded that the trial court’s\nerror in submitting immunity to the jury was “harmless\nbecause Air Wisconsin is not entitled to immunity.” Id., at\n*6. In a key footnote, the court stated: “In our determina-\ntion of immunity under the ATSA, we need not, and there-\nfore do not, decide whether the statements were true or\nfalse. Rather, we conclude that Air Wisconsin made the\nstatements with reckless disregard as to their truth or\nfalsity.” Id., at *16, n. 6. The court thus appears to\nhave labored under the assumption that even true state-\nments do not qualify for ATSA immunity if they are made\nrecklessly.\n   Applying this standard, and giving “no weight to the\njury’s finding[s],” ibid., n. 5, the court held that “[a]l-\nthough the events at the training may have warranted\na report to TSA,” Air Wisconsin’s statements “overstated\nthose events to such a degree that they were made with\nreckless disregard of their truth or falsity.” Id., at *7. The\ncourt opined that Air Wisconsin “would likely be immune\nunder the ATSA if Doyle had reported that Hoeper was an\nAir Wisconsin employee, that he knew he would be termi-\nnated soon, that he had acted irrationally at the training\nthree hours earlier and ‘blew up’ at test administrators,\nand that he was an FFDO pilot.” Id., at *8. But because\nDoyle actually told TSA “(1) that he believed Hoeper to be\nmentally unstable; (2) that Hoeper had been terminated\nearlier that day; and (3) that Hoeper may have been\narmed,” id., at *7, the court determined that his state-\nments “went well beyond” the facts and did not qualify for\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

The court went on to conclude that\nthe evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s defama-\ntion verdict.\n   Justice Eid, joined by two others, dissented in part. She\nagreed with the majority’s holding that immunity is an\nissue for the court, not the jury. But she reasoned that Air\nWisconsin was entitled to immunity “because [its] state-\nments to the TSA were substantially true.” Id., at *11.\n   We granted certiorari to decide “[w]hether ATSA im-\nmunity may be denied without a determination that the\nair carrier’s disclosure was materially false.” 570 U. S. ___\n(2013).\n                            II\n\n                             A\n\n  Congress patterned the exception to ATSA immunity\nafter the actual malice standard of New York Times Co. v.\nSullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), and we have long held that\nactual malice requires material falsity. Because we pre-\nsume that Congress meant to incorporate the settled\nmeaning of actual malice when it incorporated the lan-\nguage of that standard, we hold that a statement other-\nwise eligible for ATSA immunity may not be denied\nimmunity unless the statement is materially false.\n  In New York Times, we held that under the First\nAmendment, a public official cannot recover “for a defama-\ntory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he\nproves that the statement was made with ‘actual malice’—\nthat is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless\ndisregard of whether it was false or not.” Id., at 279–\n280. Congress borrowed this exact language in denying\nATSA immunity to “(1) any disclosure made with actual\nknowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or\nmisleading; or (2) any disclosure made with reckless\ndisregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure.”\n§44941(b).\n8        AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   One could in principle construe the language of the\nactual malice standard to cover true statements made\nrecklessly. But we have long held, to the contrary, that\nactual malice entails falsity. See, e.g., Philadelphia News-\npapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U. S. 767, 775 (1986) (“[A]s one\nmight expect given the language of the Court in New York\nTimes, a public-figure plaintiff must show the falsity of the\nstatements at issue in order to prevail in a suit for defa-\nmation” (citation omitted)); Garrison v. Louisiana, 379\nU. S. 64, 74 (1964) (“We held in New York Times that a\npublic official might be allowed the civil remedy only if he\nestablishes that the utterance was false”).\n   Indeed, we have required more than mere falsity to\nestablish actual malice: The falsity must be “material.”\nMasson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 501 U. S. 496, 517\n(1991). As we explained in Masson, “[m]inor inaccuracies\ndo not amount to falsity so long as ‘the substance, the gist,\nthe sting, of the libelous charge be justified.’ ” Ibid. A\n“statement is not considered false unless it ‘would have a\ndifferent effect on the mind of the reader from that which\nthe pleaded truth would have produced.’ ” Ibid. (quoting\nR. Sack, Libel, Slander, and Related Problems 138 (1980)).\n   These holdings were settled when Congress enacted the\nATSA, and we therefore presume that Congress meant to\nadopt the material falsity requirement when it incorpo-\nrated the actual malice standard into the ATSA immunity\nexception. “[I]t is a cardinal rule of statutory construction\nthat, when Congress employs a term of art, it presumably\nknows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached\nto each borrowed word in the body of learning from which\nit is taken.” FAA v. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip\nop., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted). The actual\nmalice standard does not cover materially true statements\nmade recklessly, so we presume that Congress did not\nmean to deny ATSA immunity to such statements.\n   Other indicia of statutory meaning could rebut this\n                   Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)               9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\npresumption, but here, they do not. First, the ATSA’s\ntext favors a falsity requirement. The first subsection of\n§44941(b) requires falsity, as a true disclosure cannot have\nbeen made “with actual knowledge” that it “was false.”\nThe only question is whether the second subsection—\nwhich denies immunity to “any disclosure made with\nreckless disregard as to [its] truth or falsity”—similarly\nrequires falsity. We conclude that it does. The second\nsubsection simply extends the immunity exception from\nknowing falsehoods to reckless ones, ensuring that an air\ncarrier cannot avoid liability for a baseless report by stick-\ning its head in the sand to avoid “actual knowledge” that\nits statements are false. “[T]he defense of truth . . . , even\nif not explicitly recognized, . . .is implicit in . . . a standard\nof recovery that rests on knowing or reckless disregard of\nthe truth.” Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469,\n498–499 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring).\n   A material falsity requirement also serves the purpose\nof ATSA immunity. The ATSA shifted from airlines to the\nTSA the responsibility “for assessing and investigating\npossible threats to airline security.” 2012 WL 907764, *14\n(Eid, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In\ndirecting the TSA to “receive, assess, and distribute intel-\nligence information related to transportation security,” 49\nU. S. C. §114(f)(1), Congress wanted to ensure that air\ncarriers and their employees would not hesitate to provide\nthe TSA with the information it needed. This is the pur-\npose of the immunity provision, evident both from its\ncontext and from the title of the statutory section that\ncontained it: “encouraging airline employees to report sus-\npicious activities.” ATSA §125, 115 Stat. 631 (capitali-\nzation and boldface type omitted). It would defeat this\npurpose to deny immunity for substantially true reports,\non the theory that the person making the report had not\nyet gathered enough information to be certain of its truth.\nSuch a rule would restore the pre-ATSA state of affairs, in\n10       AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich air carriers bore the responsibility to investigate\nand verify potential threats.\n    We therefore hold that ATSA immunity may not be\ndenied under §44941(b) to materially true statements.\nThis interpretation of the statute is clear enough that\nHoeper effectively concedes it. See Brief for Respondent\n30 (acknowledging that if the Colorado Supreme Court\nactually said “ ‘an airline may be denied ATSA immunity\n. . . for reporting true information,’ ” then “the court was\nlikely wrong”). Hoeper does point out in a footnote that\ngiven Congress’ desire to deny immunity to “ ‘bad actors,’ ”\nand “given that the vast majority of reckless statements\nwill not turn out to be true[,] . . . Congress could have\nquite reasonably chosen to deny the special privilege of\nATSA immunity to all reckless speakers,” even those\nwhose statements turned out to be true. Id., at 30, n. 12.\nBut although Congress could have made this choice, noth-\ning about the statute’s text or purpose suggests that it\nactually did. Instead, Congress chose to model the excep-\ntion to ATSA immunity after a standard we have long\nconstrued to require material falsity.\n                             B\n  We are not persuaded by Hoeper’s arguments that\nwe should affirm the judgment of the Colorado Supreme\nCourt notwithstanding its misapprehension of the ATSA\nimmunity standard.\n  Hoeper first argues that Air Wisconsin forfeited the\nclaim that it is entitled to immunity because its state-\nments were materially true. His premise is that Air\nWisconsin argued the truth of its statements only in chal-\nlenging the evidentiary basis for the defamation verdict, not\nin asserting immunity. But Air Wisconsin’s brief before\nthe Colorado Supreme Court argued that the exception to\nATSA immunity “appears to incorporate the New York\nTimes actual malice standard,” which—as we have ex-\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nplained—requires material falsity. Petitioner’s Opening\nBrief in No. 09SC1050, p. 24.\n   Hoeper next argues that the Colorado Supreme Court\nperformed the requisite analysis of material falsity, albeit\nin the context of finding the record sufficient to support\nthe jury’s defamation verdict. For several reasons, however,\nthis analysis does not suffice for us to affirm the denial\nof ATSA immunity. First, to the extent that the immunity\ndetermination belongs to the court—as the Colorado Su-\npreme Court held—a court’s deferential review of jury\nfindings cannot substitute for its own analysis of the\nrecord. Second, the jury here did not find that any falsity\nin Air Wisconsin’s statements was material, because the\ntrial court instructed it only to determine whether “[o]ne\nor more of th[e] statements was false,” App. 580, without\naddressing materiality. Third, applying the material\nfalsity standard to a defamation claim is quite different\nfrom applying it to ATSA immunity. In both contexts,\na materially false statement is one that “ ‘would have a\ndifferent effect on the mind of the reader [or listener] from\nthat which the . . . truth would have produced.’ ” Masson,\n501 U. S., at 517. But the identity of the relevant reader\nor listener varies according to the context. In determining\nwhether a falsehood is material to a defamation claim, we\ncare whether it affects the subject’s reputation in the\ncommunity. In the context of determining ATSA immu-\nnity, by contrast, we care whether a falsehood affects the\nauthorities’ perception of and response to a given threat.3\n——————\n  3 These are very different inquiries. Suppose the TSA receives the\nfollowing tip: “My adulterous husband is carrying a gun onto a flight.”\nWhether the husband is adulterous will presumably have no effect on\nthe TSA’s assessment of any security risk that he poses. So if the word\n“adulterous” is false, the caller may still be entitled to ATSA immunity.\nBut any falsity as to that word obviously would affect the husband’s\nreputation in the community, so it would be material in the context of a\ndefamation claim.\n12         AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                           III\n  Finally, the Colorado Supreme Court’s analysis of mate-\nrial falsity was erroneous. We turn next to explaining\nwhy, by applying the ATSA immunity standard to the\nfacts of this case.4\n                                A\n   We begin by addressing how to determine the material-\nity of a false statement in the ATSA context. As we noted\nearlier, a materially false statement is generally one that\n“ ‘would have a different effect on the mind of the reader\n[or listener] from that which the . . . truth would have\nproduced.’ ” Ibid. The parties quibble over whether ATSA\nimmunity requires some special version of this standard,\nbut they more or less agree—as do we—that the usual\nstandard suffices as long as the hypothetical reader or\nlistener is a security officer.\n   A further question is what it means for a statement to\nproduce “ ‘a different effect on the mind of ’ ” a security\nofficer from that which the truth would have produced. In\ndefamation law, the reputational harm caused by a false\nstatement is its effect on a reader’s or listener’s mind. But\ncontrary to the position of Hoeper’s counsel at oral argu-\nment, Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–33, courts cannot decide whether\na false statement produced “ ‘a different effect on the mind\nof ’ ” a hypothetical TSA officer without considering the\neffect of that statement on TSA’s behavior. After all, the\n\n——————\n  4 We “recognize the prudence . . . of allowing the lower courts ‘to un-\n\ndertake [a fact-intensive inquiry] in the first instance.’ ” Holland v.\nFlorida, 560 U. S. 631, 654 (2010). Here, however, we conclude that\nanother prudential consideration—the need for clear guidance on a\nnovel but important question of federal law—weighs in favor of our\napplying the ATSA immunity standard. Cf. Bose Corp. v. Consumers\nUnion of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 503 (1984) (“[T]his Court’s\nrole in marking out the limits of [a First Amendment] standard through\nthe process of case-by-case adjudication is of special importance”).\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhole reason the TSA considers threat reports is to deter-\nmine and execute a response.\n   A plaintiff seeking to defeat ATSA immunity need not\nshow “precisely what a particular official or federal agency\nwould have done in a counterfactual scenario.” Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 27. Such a showing\nwould be “impossible . . . given the need to maintain se-\ncrecy regarding airline security operations.” Brief for Re-\nspondent 42. But any falsehood cannot be material, for\npurposes of ATSA immunity, absent a substantial likeli-\nhood that a reasonable security officer would consider it\nimportant in determining a response to the supposed\nthreat. Cf. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426\nU. S. 438, 449 (1976) (an omission in a proxy solicitation\n“is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a\nreasonable shareholder would consider it important in\ndeciding how to vote”). This standard “is an objective\none, involving the [hypothetical] significance of an omitted\nor misrepresented fact to a reasonable” security official,\nrather than the actual significance of that fact to a partic-\nular security official. Id., at 445.\n                               B\n   We apply the material falsity standard to the facts of\nthis case. In doing so, we neither embrace nor reject the\nColorado Supreme Court’s unanimous holding “that im-\nmunity under the ATSA is a question of law to be deter-\nmined by the trial court before trial.” 2012 WL 9097764,\n*4; see id., at *11 (Eid, J., concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part) (agreeing with majority). Rather, we conclude\nthat even if a jury were to find the historical facts in the\nmanner most favorable to Hoeper, Air Wisconsin is enti-\ntled to ATSA immunity as a matter of law.\n   We begin with Air Wisconsin’s statement that Hoeper\n“was an FFDO who may be armed.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n111a. Hoeper cannot dispute the literal truth of this\n14         AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstatement: He was an FFDO, and because FFDOs possess\nweapons, any FFDO “may be armed.” Hoeper argues only\nthat to avoid any misinterpretation, Air Wisconsin should\nhave qualified the statement by adding that it had no\nreason to think he was actually carrying his gun during\nthe trip to Virginia, especially because he was not allowed\nto do so under §44921(f )(1).5 We agree that Air Wiscon-\nsin’s statement could have been misinterpreted by some,\nbut we reject Hoeper’s argument for two reasons. First,\nany confusion of the nature that Hoeper suggests would\nhave been immaterial: A reasonable TSA officer, having\nbeen told only that Hoeper was an FFDO and that he was\nupset about losing his job, would have wanted to investi-\ngate whether Hoeper was carrying his gun. Second, to\naccept Hoeper’s demand for such precise wording would\nvitiate the purpose of ATSA immunity: to encourage air\ncarriers and their employees, often in fast-moving situa-\ntions and with little time to fine-tune their diction, to\nprovide the TSA immediately with information about\npotential threats. Baggage handlers, flight attendants,\ngate agents, and other airline employees who report suspi-\ncious behavior to the TSA should not face financial ruin if,\nin the heat of a potential threat, they fail to choose their\nwords with exacting care.6\n——————\n   5 See Tr. of Oral Arg. 42–43 (concession by Hoeper’s counsel that “it\n\nwould have been true for [Air Wisconsin] to say, look, we’re calling to\nlet you know, because Mr. Hoeper’s an FFDO, we don’t have any reason\nto believe that he has gun with him, but we can’t tell for sure, so we\njust thought we would tell you, in case you have any questions and\nwant to investigate further”).\n   While we take the jury’s findings at face value, we note that the\nrecord suggests Air Wisconsin may well have added the qualifier that\nHoeper argues was necessary. An internal TSA e-mail summarizing\nDoyle’s call concludes by stating: “[Redacted] does not believe [redacted]\nis in possession of a firearm at this time.” App. 414.\n   6 Hoeper also takes issue with Air Wisconsin’s statement that it was\n\n“concerned about . . . the whereabouts of his firearm,” App. to Pet. for\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  We next consider Air Wisconsin’s statement that Hoeper\n“was terminated today.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a.\nWhen Air Wisconsin made that statement, Hoeper had not\nyet been fired. But everyone knew the firing was almost\ncertainly imminent. Hoeper acknowledged that his em-\nployment was “at [Air Wisconsin’s] discretion” after his\nthird failed test, App. 193, and the agreement between\nhim and Air Wisconsin stated that his “fourth . . . attempt”\nto pass the test would be his “final” one, id., at 426. No\nreasonable TSA officer would care whether an angry, po-\ntentially armed airline employee had just been fired or\nmerely knew he was about to meet that fate.\n  Finally, we consider Air Wisconsin’s statements that\nHoeper was “[u]nstable” and that it was “concerned about\nhis mental stability.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a. Al-\nthough the details of Hoeper’s behavior during the simula-\ntor session may be disputed, Hoeper himself testified that\nhe had become visibly angry: He decided “that’s it,” he\nremoved his headset and “toss[ed] it,” and he accused the\ninstructor—at an “elevated decibel level,” and with an\nexpletive—of “railroading the situation.” App. 203–204. It\nwould surely have been correct, then, for Air Wisconsin to\nreport that Hoeper “ ‘blew up’ ” during the test. 2012 WL\n907764, *8. The question is whether, from the perspective\nof a reasonable security officer, there is any material\ndifference between a statement that Hoeper had just “blown\nup” in a professional setting and a statement that he\nwas “[u]nstable.” We think not.\n  We are no more troubled by Air Wisconsin’s related\nstatement that it was “concerned about [Hoeper’s] mental\nstability.” Hoeper is correct that many of the Air Wiscon-\nsin officials who attended the meeting at headquarters\n—————— \n\nCert. 111a. But his arguments concerning this statement are the same\n\nas those concerning the statement that he “may [have] been armed,”\n\nibid., and we reject them for the same reasons. \n\n16       AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmight not have framed their concerns in terms of “men-\ntal stability.” LaWare, for instance, testified that “[t]hose\nweren’t the words that [he] would have anticipated” when\nhe directed Doyle to call the TSA. App. 272. But the\nofficials who attended the meeting did harbor concerns\nabout Hoeper’s mental state: They knew he had just\n“blown up,” and they worried about what he might do\nnext. It would be inconsistent with the ATSA’s text and\npurpose to expose Air Wisconsin to liability because its\nemployee could have chosen a slightly better phrase than\n“mental stability” to articulate its concern. Just as\n“[m]inor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity” in the\ndefamation context, “so long as ‘the substance, the gist,\nthe sting, of the libelous charge be justified,’ ” Masson, 501\nU. S., at 517, a statement that would otherwise qualify for\nATSA immunity cannot lose that immunity because of\nsome minor imprecision, so long as “the gist” of the state-\nment is accurate. Doyle’s statements to the TSA accu-\nrately conveyed “the gist” of the situation; it is irrelevant\nwhether trained lawyers or judges might with the luxury\nof time have chosen more precise words.\n   Hoeper’s overarching factual theory appears to be that\nmembers of the BAe-146 team, including Doyle and Schuer-\nman, harbored personal animosity toward him, which\ncaused them to manipulate the proficiency tests in order\nto fail him. But even if Hoeper were correct about\nall this (and we express no view on that question), we do\nnot see why it would have made him any less a threat in\nthe eyes of a reasonable security officer. As between two\nemployees—one who thinks he is being fired because of his\ninadequate skills, another who thinks he is being fired\nbecause his employer hates him—the latter is presumably\nmore, not less, likely to lash out in anger.\n   The partial dissent argues that Doyle’s reference to\nHoeper’s “mental stability” was so egregious as to make\nhis report to the TSA the basis of a $1.2 million defama-\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion judgment. We disagree. While lawyers and judges\nmay in some contexts apply the label “mentally unstable”\nto people suffering from serious mental illnesses, see post,\nat 4 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part),\nthat is hardly the only manner in which the label is used.\nA holding that Air Wisconsin lost its ATSA immunity by\nvirtue of Doyle’s failure to be aware of every connotation of\nthe phrase “mental stability” would eviscerate the immun-\nity provision. All of us from time to time use words that,\non reflection, we might modify. If such slips of the tongue\ncould give rise to major financial liability, no airline would\ncontact the TSA (or permit its employees to do so) without\nrunning by its lawyers the text of its proposed disclosure—\nexactly the kind of hesitation that Congress aimed to\navoid.\n   The partial dissent further argues that Hoeper’s “dis-\nplay of anger” made him no more a threat than “millions\nof perfectly harmless air travelers.” Post, at 4. But\nHoeper did not just lose his temper; he lost it in circum-\nstances that he knew would lead to his firing, which he\nregarded as the culmination of a vendetta against him.\nAnd he was not just any passenger; he was an FFDO,\nwhich meant that he could plausibly have been carrying a\nfirearm. In short, Hoeper was not some traveling busi-\nnessman who yelled at a barista in a fit of pique over a\nbadly brewed cup of coffee.\n   Finally, the partial dissent relies on an expert’s testi-\nmony “that Hoeper’s behavior did not warrant any report\nto the TSA.” Post, at 4 (citing App. 356). But the expert\nappears to have based that statement on an outdated\nunderstanding of reporting obligations that is flatly at\nodds with the ATSA. Prior to the ATSA, “airlines were\nresponsible for assessing and investigating possible\nthreats to airline security.” 2012 WL 907764, *14 (Eid, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). But the ATSA\nshifted that responsibility to the TSA, creating a policy\n18       AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“known as ‘when in doubt, report.’ ” Ibid.; see supra, at 9.\nThe expert who believed that Hoeper’s conduct did not\nwarrant a report to the TSA also believed that airlines\nhave “an obligation . . . to filter out . . . the low noise from\n. . . what’s significant” in reporting threats. App. 356.\nThat understanding does not comport with the policy that\nCongress chose to enact.\n    The Colorado Supreme Court recognized that even if the\nfacts are viewed in the light most favorable to Hoeper, Air\nWisconsin “would likely be immune” had it “reported that\nHoeper . . . knew he would be terminated soon, that he\nhad acted irrationally at the training three hours earlier\nand ‘blew up’ at test administrators, and that he was an\nFFDO pilot.” 2012 WL 907764, *8. But the court erred in\nparsing so finely the distinctions between these hypothet-\nical statements and the ones that Air Wisconsin actually\nmade. The minor differences are, for the reasons we have\nexplained, immaterial as a matter of law in determining\nAir Wisconsin’s ATSA immunity.\n    By incorporating the actual malice standard into\n§44941(b), Congress meant to give air carriers the\n“ ‘breathing space’ ” to report potential threats to security\nofficials without fear of civil liability for a few inaptly\nchosen words. New York Times, 376 U. S., at 272. To hold\nAir Wisconsin liable for minor misstatements or loose\nwording would undermine that purpose and disregard the\nstatutory text.\n                        *    *     *\n  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado is\ntherefore reversed, and the case is remanded for proceed-\nings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

WILLIAM L. HOEPER \n\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF \n\n                      COLORADO\n\n                      [January 27, 2014]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and\nJUSTICE KAGAN join, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart.\n   I agree with the Court that under the Aviation and\nTransportation Security Act (ATSA), 49 U. S. C. §44901\net seq., an airline may not be denied immunity for a re-\nport it made to the Transportation Security Administration\n(TSA) absent a finding that the report was materially\nfalse. I also agree that, in this context, materiality means\nthat the falsehood had a natural tendency to influence a\nreasonable TSA officer’s determination of an appropriate\nresponse to the report; and that neither the jury nor the\ncourts below considered material falsity in this ATSA-\nspecific way. I therefore join Parts I, II, and III–A of the\nCourt’s opinion.\n   Having answered the question we granted certiorari to\ndecide, see 570 U. S. ___ (2013), I would stop there and\nremand the case for further proceedings. Instead, the\nCourt proceeds to “apply the [ATSA] material falsity\nstandard to the facts of this case” in the first instance,\nante, at 13, and concludes as a matter of law that Air\nWisconsin’s report to the TSA about William Hoeper was\nnot materially false. In so holding, the Court in my view\nreaches out to decide a factbound question better left to\nthe lower courts, and then proceeds to give the wrong\n2        AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nanswer. I therefore respectfully dissent from Part III–B\nand the disposition.\n   We have held that under the First Amendment, a court’s\nrole is to determine whether “[a] reasonable jury could\nfind a material difference between” the defendant’s state-\nment and the truth. Masson v. New Yorker Magazine,\nInc., 501 U. S. 496, 522 (1991). That makes sense, since\nmateriality is the sort of “ ‘mixed question of law and fact’ ”\nthat “has typically been resolved by juries.” United States\nv. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 512 (1995). The jury has a vital\nrole to play in the materiality inquiry, which entails “ ‘deli-\ncate assessments of the inferences a “reasonable deci-\nsionmaker” would draw from a given set of facts and the\nsignificance of those inferences to him’ ” and is therefore\n“ ‘peculiarly one for the trier of fact.’ ” Ibid. (quoting TSC\nIndustries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 450\n(1976); brackets omitted). Such a question cannot be\nwithdrawn from the jury unless “the facts and the law will\nreasonably support only one conclusion” on which “reason-\nable persons . . . could [not] differ.” McDermott Int’l, Inc.\nv. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337, 356 (1991). The same rule\napplies to a determination of immunity from suit: When a\ndefendant raises qualified immunity on summary judg-\nment, the court must “adop[t] . . . the plaintiff ’s version\nof the facts” unless “no reasonable jury could believe it.”\nScott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 378–380 (2007).\n   Therefore, if we are to apply the ATSA materiality\nstandard to the complex record in this case in the first\ninstance, it is proper to view “the historical facts in the\nmanner most favorable to Hoeper,” as the Court purports\nto do. Ante, at 13. We must of course begin by taking as\ngiven the findings that we know the jury already made,\nincluding that Air Wisconsin told the TSA that the airline\nwas “concerned about [Hoeper’s] mental stability” and that\nhe was an “[u]nstable pilot,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a\n(special verdict form), and that those statements were\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nfalse, 2012 WL 907764, *10 (Colo., Mar. 19, 2012). Next,\nwe must ask whether a reasonable jury could find the\nremaining historical facts to be such that those statements\nwere not only false, but materially false from the perspec-\ntive of a reasonable TSA agent. If not, judgment for Air\nWisconsin is proper; but if so, the ATSA materiality ques-\ntion should be tried to a (properly instructed) jury. (Un-\nless, of course, a reasonable jury would be compelled to\nfind facts that would render the statements materially\nfalse, in which case judgment for Hoeper would be proper;\nbut that is assuredly not the case here.)\n   Applying that reasonable-jury standard, I do not see\nhow we can possibly hold as a matter of law that Air\nWisconsin’s report was not materially false. The Court\nacknowledges Hoeper’s description of the confrontation\nthat spawned the airline’s threat report: After failing\na flight simulator test, Hoeper “decided ‘that’s it,’ he\nremoved his headset and ‘toss[ed] it,’ and he accused\nthe instructor—at an ‘elevated decibel level,’ and with\nan expletive—of ‘railroading the situation.’ ” Ante, at 15\n(quoting App. 203–204). A jury could credit Hoeper’s\naccount. It could also believe his “overarching factual\ntheory” that his anger was reasonable because the instruc-\ntor had “manipulate[d]” the test to cause him to fail out of\n“personal animosity,” ante, at 16—a theory that was not\nwithout supporting evidence, see, e.g., App. 259–260 (pilot\ntestifying as expert witness that Hoeper’s testing was\n“absolutely unfair” and “biased”). Moreover, there was\nevidence from which a jury could conclude that no one who\ninteracted with Hoeper during or after the confrontation—\nincluding the instructor—viewed him as either unstable or\nthreatening. See, e.g., id., at 15–16 (instructor acknowl-\nedging that he “ ‘quickly realized it wasn’t a threatening\nsituation’ ”); id., at 29–31 (instructor testifying he “ ‘never\nfelt that [Hoeper] was going to go do something stupid,’ ”\n“ ‘didn’t believe that Mr. Hoeper posed a threat in any way\n4         AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                        Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nto anybody else at all,’ ” “ ‘did not believe that Mr. Hoeper\nwas engaging in irrational behavior,’ ” and “ ‘deem[ed] him\nperfectly safe to get on an airplane’ ”); id., at 462 (airline\nrepresentative who gave Hoeper permission to fly home\ntestifying he “had no concern that [Hoeper] was a physical\nthreat to anybody” and “didn’t believe he was mentally\nunstable”).\n  In short, a jury could find that Hoeper did nothing more\nthan engage in a brief, run-of-the-mill, and arguably\njustified display of anger that included raising his voice\nand swearing, but that did not cause anyone, including the\nperson on the receiving end of the outburst, to view him as\neither irrational or a potential source of violence. Viewing\nthe facts in that light, I cannot agree with the Court that\na reasonable TSA official would not “consider . . . im-\nportant,” ante, at 13, the difference between an individual\nwho engaged in this sort of heated but commonplace dis-\nplay of anger, on the one hand, and on the other, an\nindividual whose colleagues regard him as “mentally unsta-\nble.” It is the difference between a category that no doubt\nincludes millions of perfectly harmless air travelers and\none that, in ordinary parlance, connotes an alarming\ndegree of unpredictability and aggressiveness. Indeed, we\nhave used that term in connection with individuals so\n“dangerously mentally ill” that they may be subject to civil\nconfinement. Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 363\n(1997). The importance of that difference was highlighted\nby the expert testimony in this case of a former TSA Fed-\neral Security Director, who stated—based on a version of\nthe underlying facts the jury was entitled to accept—that\nHoeper’s behavior did not warrant any report to the TSA.\nApp. 356.*\n——————\n  * The Court dismisses the former Director’s testimony because he\ntestified that in making threat reports to the TSA, airline officials\nshould use “common sense” to “filter out the garbage and report [only]\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                      5\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n  The association with dangerous mental illness is not, as\nthe Court suggests, merely one “connotation of the phrase\n‘mental [in]stability’ ” among many, ante, at 17; it is the\neveryday understanding of that phrase. The Court says\nthat this is “hardly the only manner in which the label is\nused,” ibid., but it does not even attempt to describe an-\nother usage, let alone one that would be a materially\naccurate description of the facts of this case as a jury\nmight find them. The Court also suggests that the cir-\ncumstances of this case—particularly the fact that Hoeper\nknew his firing was imminent, had reason to be angry\nwith the airline, and was authorized to carry a firearm—\ndistinguish Hoeper’s confrontation with the instructor\nfrom an ordinary “fit of pique.” Ibid. But if so, it was all\nthe more important for the airline to make an accurate\nreport to the TSA, so that the agency could assess the\npossible danger and determine an appropriate response.\nFalsely reporting to the TSA that a young Irishman is an\nIRA terrorist is much more likely to produce a prompt\nand erroneous response than reporting that a 70-year-old\nEnglish grandmother is. The circumstances the Court\nidentifies enhanced, rather than diminished, the likeli-\nhood that the false “mentally unstable” designation would\nhave a material effect on the TSA’s response.\n  In sum, it is simply implausible that, taking the facts of\n——————\nreally suspicious incidents,” App. 356, a view the Court deems “flatly at\nodds with the ATSA,” ante, at 17. The ATSA, however, simply requires\nairlines to report “threat[s] to civil aviation,” 49 U. S. C. §44905(a). The\nstatute surely places a heavy thumb on the scale in favor of reporting,\nbut it certainly does not preclude the exercise of reasonable judgment\nin deciding what rises to the level of a “threat” and what constitutes, as\nthe former Director put it, irrelevant “garbage.” And even if one\ndisagrees with the former Director that no report should have been\nmade at all, the point is that a reasonable jury could have considered\nhis testimony relevant to establishing that falsely expressing concerns\nabout an individual’s “mental stability” in the circumstances of this\ncase would have a material effect on the TSA’s decisionmaking process.\n6        AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORP. v. HOEPER\n\n                    Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthis case in the light most favorable to Hoeper, a reason-\nable jury would have to find that the report of mental in-\nstability would have no effect upon the course of action\ndetermined by the TSA. The Court’s holding to the con-\ntrary demonstrates the wisdom of preserving the jury’s\nrole in this inquiry, designed to inject a practical sense\nthat judges sometimes lack. I respectfully dissent from\nthat holding.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2654278/", "sha1": "1dbaaa45abf721a9d563993711fbec2c3b7d48b7", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-017", "time_retrieved": "2014-02-24T09:01:45.129015"}
