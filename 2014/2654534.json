CALIFORNIA\n\n    CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA,\n\n               SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\n\nNo. 12–7822. Argued November 13, 2013—Decided February 25, 2014\nPolice officers observed a suspect in a violent robbery run into an\n  apartment building, and heard screams coming from one of the\n  apartments. They knocked on the apartment door, which was an-\n  swered by Roxanne Rojas, who appeared to be battered and bleeding.\n  When the officers asked her to step out of the apartment so that they\n  could conduct a protective sweep, petitioner came to the door and ob-\n  jected. Suspecting that he had assaulted Rojas, the officers removed\n  petitioner from the apartment and placed him under arrest. He was\n  then identified as the perpetrator in the earlier robbery and taken to\n  the police station. An officer later returned to the apartment and, af-\n  ter obtaining Rojas’ oral and written consent, searched the premises,\n  where he found several items linking petitioner to the robbery. The\n  trial court denied petitioner’s motion to suppress that evidence, and\n  he was convicted. The California Court of Appeal affirmed. It held\n  that because petitioner was not present when Rojas consented to the\n  search, the exception to permissible warrantless consent searches of\n  jointly occupied premises that arises when one of the occupants pre-\n  sent objects to the search, Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, did not\n  apply, and therefore, petitioner’s suppression motion had been\n  properly denied.\nHeld: Randolph does not extend to this situation, where Rojas’ consent\n was provided well after petitioner had been removed from their\n apartment. Pp. 5–15.\n    (a) Consent searches are permissible warrantless searches,\n Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 228, 231–232, and are\n clearly reasonable when the consent comes from the sole occupant of\n the premises. When multiple occupants are involved, the rule ex-\n tends to the search of the premises or effects of an absent, noncon-\n2                      FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    senting occupant so long as “the consent of one who possesses com-\n    mon authority over [the] premises or effects” is obtained. United\n    States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164, 170. However, when “a physically\n    present inhabitan[t]” refuses to consent, that refusal “is dispositive as\n    to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant.” Randolph,\n    547 U. S., at 122–123. A controlling factor in Randolph was the ob-\n    jecting occupant’s physical presence. See, e.g., id., at 106, 108, 109,\n    114. Pp. 5–9.\n       (b) Petitioner contends that, though he was not present when Rojas\n    consented, Randolph nevertheless controls, but neither of his argu-\n    ments is sound. Pp. 9–14.\n          (1) He first argues that his absence should not matter since it oc-\n    curred only because the police had taken him away. Dictum in Ran-\n    dolph suggesting that consent by one occupant might not be sufficient\n    if “there is evidence that the police have removed the potentially ob-\n    jecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible\n    objection,” 547 U. S., at 121, is best understood to refer to situations\n    in which the removal of the potential objector is not objectively rea-\n    sonable. Petitioner does not contest the fact that the police had rea-\n    sonable grounds for his removal or the existence of probable cause for\n    his arrest. He was thus in the same position as an occupant absent\n    for any other reason. Pp. 9–10.\n          (2) Petitioner also argues that the objection he made while at the\n    threshold remained effective until he changed his mind and withdrew\n    it. This is inconsistent with Randolph in at least two important\n    ways. It cannot be squared with the “widely shared social expecta-\n    tions” or “customary social usage” upon which Randolph’s holding\n    was based. 547 U. S., at 111, 121. It also creates the sort of practical\n    complications that Randolph sought to avoid by adopting a “formal-\n    is[tic]” rule, id., at 121, e.g., requiring that the scope of an objection’s\n    duration and the procedures necessary to register a continuing objec-\n    tion be defined. Pp. 10–14.\n       (c) Petitioner claims that his expansive interpretation of Randolph\n    would not hamper law enforcement because in most cases where of-\n    ficers have probable cause to arrest a physically present objector they\n    also have probable cause to obtain a warrant to search the premises\n    that the objector does not want them to enter. But he misunder-\n    stands the constitutional status of consent searches, which are per-\n    missible irrespective of the availability of a warrant. Requiring offic-\n    ers to obtain a warrant when a warrantless search is justified may\n    interfere with law enforcement strategies and impose an unmerited\n    burden on the person willing to consent to an immediate search.\n    Pp. 14–15.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

CALIFORNIA\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF \n\n     CALIFORNIA FOR THE SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\n                               [February 25, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Our cases firmly establish that police officers may\nsearch jointly occupied premises if one of the occupants1\nconsents. See United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164\n(1974). In Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103 (2006), we\nrecognized a narrow exception to this rule, holding that\nthe consent of one occupant is insufficient when another\noccupant is present and objects to the search. In this case,\nwe consider whether Randolph applies if the objecting\noccupant is absent when another occupant consents. Our\nopinion in Randolph took great pains to emphasize that its\nholding was limited to situations in which the objecting\noccupant is physically present. We therefore refuse to\nextend Randolph to the very different situation in this\ncase, where consent was provided by an abused woman\nwell after her male partner had been removed from the\napartment they shared.\n\n\n——————\n  1 We  use the terms “occupant,” “resident,” and “tenant” interchangea-\nbly to refer to persons having “common authority” over premises within\nthe meaning of Matlock. See United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164,\n171, n. 7 (1974).\n2                FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n    The events involved in this case occurred in Los Angeles\nin October 2009. After observing Abel Lopez cash a check,\npetitioner Walter Fernandez approached Lopez and asked\nabout the neighborhood in which he lived. When Lopez\nresponded that he was from Mexico, Fernandez laughed\nand told Lopez that he was in territory ruled by the\n“D.F.S.,” i.e., the “Drifters” gang. App. 4–5. Petitioner\nthen pulled out a knife and pointed it at Lopez’ chest.\nLopez raised his hand in self-defense, and petitioner cut\nhim on the wrist.\n    Lopez ran from the scene and called 911 for help, but\npetitioner whistled, and four men emerged from a nearby\napartment building and attacked Lopez. After knocking\nhim to the ground, they hit and kicked him and took his\ncell phone and his wallet, which contained $400 in cash.\n    A police dispatch reported the incident and mentioned\nthe possibility of gang involvement, and two Los Angeles\npolice officers, Detective Clark and Officer Cirrito, drove\nto an alley frequented by members of the Drifters. A man\nwho appeared scared walked by the officers and said:\n“ ‘[T]he guy is in the apartment.’ ” Id., at 5. The officers\nthen observed a man run through the alley and into the\nbuilding to which the man was pointing. A minute or two\nlater, the officers heard sounds of screaming and fighting\ncoming from that building.\n    After backup arrived, the officers knocked on the door of\nthe apartment unit from which the screams had been\nheard. Roxanne Rojas answered the door. She was hold-\ning a baby and appeared to be crying. Her face was red,\nand she had a large bump on her nose. The officers also\nsaw blood on her shirt and hand from what appeared to be\na fresh injury. Rojas told the police that she had been in a\nfight. Officer Cirrito asked if anyone else was in the\napartment, and Rojas said that her 4-year-old son was the\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

I know my\nrights.’ ” Id., at 6. Suspecting that petitioner had assaulted\nRojas, the officers removed him from the apartment\nand then placed him under arrest. Lopez identified peti-\ntioner as his initial attacker, and petitioner was taken to\nthe police station for booking.\n   Approximately one hour after petitioner’s arrest, Detec-\ntive Clark returned to the apartment and informed Rojas\nthat petitioner had been arrested. Detective Clark re-\nquested and received both oral and written consent from\nRojas to search the premises.2 In the apartment, the\npolice found Drifters gang paraphernalia, a butterfly\nknife, clothing worn by the robbery suspect, and ammuni-\ntion. Rojas’ young son also showed the officers where\npetitioner had hidden a sawed-off shotgun.\n                           B\n Petitioner was charged with robbery, Cal.

Post, at 9, n. 5 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). But the trial court\nfound otherwise, App. 152, and the correctness of that finding is not\nbefore us. In suggesting that Rojas’ consent was coerced, the dissent\nrecites portions of Rojas’ testimony from the suppression hearing that\nthe trial judge appears to have rejected. Ibid. Similarly, the jury\nplainly did not find Rojas to be credible. At trial, she testified for the\ndefense and told the jury, among other things, that the wounds ob-\nserved by the officers who came to her door were not inflicted by peti-\ntioner but by a woman looking for petitioner during a fight. 208 Cal.\nApp. 4th 100, 109–110, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Petitioner then pleaded nolo conten-\ndere to the firearms and ammunition charges. On the re-\nmaining counts—for robbery and infliction of corporal\ninjury—he went to trial and was found guilty by a jury.\nThe court sentenced him to 14 years of imprisonment.\n   The California Court of Appeal affirmed. 208 Cal.

Because Randolph\ndid not overturn our prior decisions recognizing that an\noccupant may give effective consent to search a shared\nresidence, the court agreed with the majority of the federal\ncircuits that an objecting occupant’s physical presence is\n“indispensible to the decision in Randolph.” Id., at 122,\n145 Cal.

Id.,\nat 121, 145 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 65.\n   The California Supreme Court denied the petition for\nreview, and we granted certiorari. 569 U.

King, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 5). Our cases establish that a warrant is\ngenerally required for a search of a home, Brigham City v.\nStuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006), but “the ultimate touch-\nstone of the Fourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness,’ ” ibid.;\nsee also Michigan v. Fisher, 558 U. S. 45, 47 (2009) ( per\ncuriam). And certain categories of permissible warrant-\nless searches have long been recognized.\n   Consent searches occupy one of these categories. “Con-\nsent searches are part of the standard investigatory\ntechniques of law enforcement agencies” and are “a con-\nstitutionally permissible and wholly legitimate aspect of\neffective police activity.” Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412\nU. S. 218, 228, 231–232 (1973). It would be unreasonable—\nindeed, absurd—to require police officers to obtain a war-\nrant when the sole owner or occupant of a house or apart-\nment voluntarily consents to a search. The owner of a\nhome has a right to allow others to enter and examine the\npremises, and there is no reason why the owner should not\nbe permitted to extend this same privilege to police officers\nif that is the owner’s choice. Where the owner believes\n\n—————— \n\nsome objective manifestation that he has changed his position and no \n\nlonger objects”). \n\n6                   FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat he or she is under suspicion, the owner may want the\npolice to search the premises so that their suspicions are\ndispelled. This may be particularly important where the\nowner has a strong interest in the apprehension of the\nperpetrator of a crime and believes that the suspicions of\nthe police are deflecting the course of their investigation.\nAn owner may want the police to search even where they\nlack probable cause, and if a warrant were always re-\nquired, this could not be done. And even where the police\ncould establish probable cause, requiring a warrant de-\nspite the owner’s consent would needlessly inconvenience\neveryone involved—not only the officers and the magis-\ntrate but also the occupant of the premises, who would\ngenerally either be compelled or would feel a need to stay\nuntil the search was completed. Michigan v. Summers,\n452 U. S. 692, 701 (1981).4\n   While it is clear that a warrantless search is reasonable\nwhen the sole occupant of a house or apartment consents,\nwhat happens when there are two or more occupants?\nMust they all consent? Must they all be asked? Is consent\nby one occupant enough? The Court faced that problem 40\nyears ago in United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164\n(1974).\n   In that case, Matlock and a woman named Graff were\nliving together in a house that was also occupied by several\nof Graff ’s siblings and by her mother, who had rented\nthe house. While in the front yard of the house, Matlock\nwas arrested for bank robbery and was placed in a squad\ncar. Although the police could have easily asked him for\n——————\n  4 A main theme of the dissent is that the police in this case had prob-\n\nable cause to search the apartment and therefore could have obtained a\nwarrant. Of course, this will not always be so in cases in which one\noccupant consents to a search and the other objects, and the dissent\ndoes not suggest that a warrant should be required only when probable\ncause is present. As a result, the dissent’s repeated references to the\navailability of a warrant in this case are beside the point.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconsent to search the room that he and Graff shared, they\ndid not do so. Instead, they knocked on the door and\nobtained Graff ’s permission to search. The search yielded\nincriminating evidence, which the defendant sought to\nsuppress, but this Court held that Graff ’s consent justified\nthe warrantless search. As the Court put it, “the consent\nof one who possesses common authority over premises or\neffects is valid as against the absent, nonconsenting per-\nson with whom that authority is shared.” Id., at 170.\n  In Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177 (1990), the Court\nreaffirmed and extended the Matlock holding. In Rodri-\nguez, a woman named Fischer told police officers that she\nhad been assaulted by Rodriguez in what she termed “ ‘our’\napartment.” 497 U. S., at 179. She also informed the\nofficers that Rodriguez was asleep in the apartment, and\nshe then accompanied the officers to that unit. When they\narrived, the officers could have knocked on the door and\nawakened Rodriguez, and had they done so, Rodriguez\nmight well have surrendered at the door and objected to\nthe officers’ entry. Instead, Fischer unlocked the door, the\nofficers entered without a warrant, and they saw drug\nparaphernalia and containers filled with white powder in\nplain view.\n  After the search, the police learned that Fischer no\nlonger resided at the apartment, and this Court held that\nshe did not have common authority over the premises at\nthe time in question. The Court nevertheless held that\nthe warrantless entry was lawful because the police rea-\nsonably believed that Fischer was a resident. Id., at 188–\n189.\n                               B\n  While consent by one resident of jointly occupied prem-\nises is generally sufficient to justify a warrantless search,\nwe recognized a narrow exception to this rule in Georgia v.\nRandolph, 547 U. S. 103 (2006). In that case, police offi-\n8                FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncers responded to the Randolphs’ home after receiving a\nreport of a domestic dispute. When the officers arrived,\nJanet Randolph informed the officers that her estranged\nhusband, Scott Randolph, was a cocaine user and that\nthere were “items of drug evidence” in the house. Id., at\n107 (internal quotation marks omitted). The officers first\nasked Scott for consent to search, but he “unequivocally\nrefused.” Ibid. The officers then turned to Janet, and she\nconsented to the search, which produced evidence that was\nlater used to convict Scott for possession of cocaine.\n   Without questioning the prior holdings in Matlock and\nRodriguez, this Court held that Janet Randolph’s consent\nwas insufficient under the circumstances to justify the\nwarrantless search. The Court reiterated the proposition\nthat a person who shares a residence with others assumes\nthe risk that “any one of them may admit visitors, with\nthe consequence that a guest obnoxious to one may never-\ntheless be admitted in his absence by another.” 547 U. S.,\nat 111. But the Court held that “a physically present\ninhabitant’s express refusal of consent to a police search\n[of his home] is dispositive as to him, regardless of the\nconsent of a fellow occupant.” Id., at 122–123 (emphasis\nadded).\n   The Court’s opinion went to great lengths to make clear\nthat its holding was limited to situations in which the\nobjecting occupant is present. Again and again, the opin-\nion of the Court stressed this controlling factor. See id., at\n106 (“present at the scene”); ibid.

The\nCourt’s opinion could hardly have been clearer on this\npoint, and the separate opinion filed by JUSTICE BREYER,\nwhose vote was decisive, was equally unambiguous. See\nid., at 126 (concurring) (“The Court’s opinion does not\napply where the objector is not present ‘and object[ing]’ ”).\n                            III\n   In this case, petitioner was not present when Rojas\nconsented, but petitioner still contends that Randolph is\ncontrolling. He advances two main arguments. First, he\nclaims that his absence should not matter since he was\nabsent only because the police had taken him away.\nSecond, he maintains that it was sufficient that he objected\nto the search while he was still present. Such an objec-\ntion, he says, should remain in effect until the objecting\nparty “no longer wishes to keep the police out of his home.”\nBrief for Petitioner 8. Neither of these arguments is\nsound.\n                             A\n   We first consider the argument that the presence of the\nobjecting occupant is not necessary when the police are\nresponsible for his absence. In Randolph, the Court sug-\ngested in dictum that consent by one occupant might not\nbe sufficient if “there is evidence that the police have\nremoved the potentially objecting tenant from the en-\ntrance for the sake of avoiding a possible objection.” 547\nU. S., at 121. We do not believe the statement should be\nread to suggest that improper motive may invalidate\nobjectively justified removal. Hence, it does not govern\nhere.\n   The Randolph dictum is best understood not to require\nan inquiry into the subjective intent of officers who detain\nor arrest a potential objector but instead to refer to situa-\ntions in which the removal of the potential objector is not\n10              FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nobjectively reasonable. As petitioner acknowledges, see\nBrief for Petitioner 25, our Fourth Amendment cases\n“have repeatedly rejected” a subjective approach.\nBrigham City, 547 U. S., at 404 (alteration and internal\nquotation marks omitted). “Indeed, we have never held,\noutside limited contexts such as an ‘inventory search or\nadministrative inspection . . . , that an officer’s motive\ninvalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the\nFourth Amendment.’ ” King, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10).\n  Petitioner does not claim that the Randolph Court\nmeant to break from this consistent practice, and we do\nnot think that it did. And once it is recognized that the\ntest is one of objective reasonableness, petitioner’s argu-\nment collapses. He does not contest the fact that the\npolice had reasonable grounds for removing him from the\napartment so that they could speak with Rojas, an appar-\nent victim of domestic violence, outside of petitioner’s\npotentially intimidating presence. In fact, he does not\neven contest the existence of probable cause to place him\nunder arrest. We therefore hold that an occupant who is\nabsent due to a lawful detention or arrest stands in the\nsame shoes as an occupant who is absent for any other\nreason.\n  This conclusion does not “make a mockery of Randolph,”\nas petitioner protests. Brief for Petitioner 9. It simply\naccepts Randolph on its own terms. The Randolph hold-\ning unequivocally requires the presence of the objecting\noccupant in every situation other than the one mentioned\nin the dictum discussed above.\n                             B\n  This brings us to petitioner’s second argument, viz., that\nhis objection, made at the threshold of the premises that\nthe police wanted to search, remained effective until he\nchanged his mind and withdrew his objection. This argu-\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nment is inconsistent with Randolph’s reasoning in at least\ntwo important ways. First, the argument cannot be\nsquared with the “widely shared social expectations” or\n“customary social usage” upon which the Randolph hold-\ning was based. See 547 U. S., at 111, 121. Explaining\nwhy consent by one occupant could not override an objec-\ntion by a physically present occupant, the Randolph Court\nstated:\n     “[I]t is fair to say that a caller standing at the door of\n     shared premises would have no confidence that one\n     occupant’s invitation was a sufficiently good reason to\n     enter when a fellow tenant stood there saying, ‘stay\n     out.’ Without some very good reason, no sensible per-\n     son would go inside under those conditions.” Id., at\n     113.\n   It seems obvious that the calculus of this hypothetical\ncaller would likely be quite different if the objecting tenant\nwas not standing at the door. When the objecting occu-\npant is standing at the threshold saying “stay out,” a\nfriend or visitor invited to enter by another occupant can\nexpect at best an uncomfortable scene and at worst vio-\nlence if he or she tries to brush past the objector. But\nwhen the objector is not on the scene (and especially when\nit is known that the objector will not return during the\ncourse of the visit), the friend or visitor is much more\nlikely to accept the invitation to enter.5 Thus, petitioner’s\n——————\n  5 Although the dissent intimates that “customary social usage” goes\n\nfurther than this, see post, at 4, the dissent provides no support for this\ndoubtful proposition. In the present case, for example, suppose that\nRojas had called a relative, a friend, a supportive neighbor, or a person\nwho works for a group that aids battered women and had invited that\nindividual to enter and examine the premises while petitioner was in\njail. Would any of those invitees have felt that it was beyond Rojas’\nauthority to extend that invitation over petitioner’s objection?\n  Instead of attempting to show that such persons would have felt it\nimproper to accept this invitation, the dissent quickly changes the\n12                  FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nargument is inconsistent with Randolph’s reasoning.\n   Second, petitioner’s argument would create the very sort\nof practical complications that Randolph sought to avoid.\nThe Randolph Court recognized that it was adopting a\n“formalis[tic]” rule, but it did so in the interests of “simple\nclarity” and administrability. Id., at 121, 122.\n   The rule that petitioner would have us adopt would\nproduce a plethora of practical problems. For one thing,\nthere is the question of duration. Petitioner argues that\nan objection, once made, should last until it is withdrawn\nby the objector, but such a rule would be unreasonable.\nSuppose that a husband and wife owned a house as joint\ntenants and that the husband, after objecting to a search\nof the house, was convicted and sentenced to a 15-year\nprison term. Under petitioner’s proposed rule, the wife\nwould be unable to consent to a search of the house 10\nyears after the date on which her husband objected. We\nrefuse to stretch Randolph to such strange lengths.\n   Nor are we persuaded to hold that an objection lasts for\na “reasonable” time. “[I]t is certainly unusual for this\nCourt to set forth precise time limits governing police\naction,” Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. 98, 110 (2010), and\nwhat interval of time would be reasonable in this context?\nA week? A month? A year? Ten years?\n   Petitioner’s rule would also require the police and ulti-\nmately the courts to determine whether, after the passage\nof time, an objector still had “common authority” over the\npremises, and this would often be a tricky question. Sup-\npose that an incarcerated objector and a consenting co-\noccupant were joint tenants on a lease. If the objector,\n——————\nsubject and says that “conjectures about social behavior shed little light\non the constitutionality” of the search in this case. Post, at 4. But the\nholding in Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103 (2006), was based on\n“widely shared social expectations” and “customary social usage.” See\nId., at 111, 121. Thus, the dissent simply fails to come to grips with the\nreasoning of the precedent on which it relies.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nafter incarceration, stopped paying rent, would he still\nhave “common authority,” and would his objection retain\nits force? Would it be enough that his name remained\non the lease? Would the result be different if the object-\ning and consenting lessees had an oral month-to-month\ntenancy?\n   Another problem concerns the procedure needed to\nregister a continuing objection. Would it be necessary for\nan occupant to object while police officers are at the door?\nIf presence at the time of consent is not needed, would an\noccupant have to be present at the premises when the\nobjection was made? Could an objection be made pre-\nemptively? Could a person like Scott Randolph, suspect-\ning that his estranged wife might invite the police to view\nhis drug stash and paraphernalia, register an objection in\nadvance? Could this be done by posting a sign in front of\nthe house? Could a standing objection be registered by\nserving notice on the chief of police?\n   Finally, there is the question of the particular law en-\nforcement officers who would be bound by an objection.\nWould this set include just the officers who were present\nwhen the objection was made? Would it also apply to\nother officers working on the same investigation? Would\nit extend to officers who were unaware of the objection?\nHow about officers assigned to different but arguably\nrelated cases? Would it be limited by law enforcement\nagency?\n   If Randolph is taken at its word—that it applies only\nwhen the objector is standing in the door saying “stay out”\nwhen officers propose to make a consent search—all of\nthese problems disappear.\n   In response to these arguments, petitioner argues that\nRandolph’s requirement of physical presence is not with-\nout its own ambiguity. And we acknowledge that if, as we\nconclude, Randolph requires presence on the premises to\nbe searched, there may be cases in which the outer bound-\n14              FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nary of the premises is disputed. The Court confronted a\nsimilar problem last Term in Bailey v. United States, 568\nU. S. ___ (2013), but despite arguments similar to those\nnow offered by petitioner, the Court adopted a rule that\napplies only when the affected individual is near the\npremises being searched. Having held that a premises\nrule is workable in that context, we see no ground for\nreaching a different conclusion here.\n                             C\n   Petitioner argues strenuously that his expansive inter-\npretation of Randolph would not hamper law enforcement\nbecause in most cases where officers have probable cause\nto arrest a physically present objector they also have\nprobable cause to search the premises that the objector\ndoes not want them to enter, see Brief for Petitioner 20–\n23, but this argument misunderstands the constitutional\nstatus of consent searches. A warrantless consent search\nis reasonable and thus consistent with the Fourth\nAmendment irrespective of the availability of a warrant.\nEven with modern technological advances, the warrant\nprocedure imposes burdens on the officers who wish to\nsearch, the magistrate who must review the warrant\napplication, and the party willing to give consent. When\na warrantless search is justified, requiring the police to\nobtain a warrant may “unjustifiably interfer[e] with legit-\nimate law enforcement strategies.” King, 563 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 13). Such a requirement may also impose an\nunmerited burden on the person who consents to an im-\nmediate search, since the warrant application procedure\nentails delay. Putting the exception the Court adopted in\nRandolph to one side, the lawful occupant of a house or\napartment should have the right to invite the police to\nenter the dwelling and conduct a search. Any other rule\nwould trample on the rights of the occupant who is willing\nto consent. Such an occupant may want the police to\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

S., at 116; see also\nSchneckloth, 412 U. S., at 243 (evidence obtained pursuant\nto a consent search “may insure that a wholly innocent\nperson is not wrongly charged with a criminal offense”).\nAnd an occupant may want the police to conduct a thor-\nough search so that any dangerous contraband can be\nfound and removed. In this case, for example, the search\nresulted in the discovery and removal of a sawed-off shot-\ngun to which Rojas’ 4-year-old son had access.\n  Denying someone in Rojas’ position the right to allow\nthe police to enter her home would also show disrespect for\nher independence. Having beaten Rojas, petitioner would\nbar her from controlling access to her own home until such\ntime as he chose to relent.

Randolph,\n547 U. S. 103 (2006), was wrongly decided. I nonetheless\njoin the Court’s opinion because it is a faithful application\nof Randolph. I write separately to address the argument\nthat the search of petitioner’s shared apartment violated\nthe Fourth Amendment because he had a right under\nproperty law to exclude the police. See Brief for National\nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae\n17–23. The United States dismisses that argument,\npointing to our statement in United States v. Matlock, 415\nU. S. 164, 171, n. 7 (1974), that a cotenant’s ability to con-\nsent to a search “does not rest upon the law of property,\nwith its attendant historical and legal refinements.”\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23.\n   I do not think the argument can be so easily dismissed.\nTo be sure, under Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347\n(1967), “property rights ‘are not the sole measure of\nFourth Amendment violations.’ ” Florida v. Jardines, 569\nU. S. 1, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3). But as we have recently\nmade clear, “[t]he Katz reasonable-expectations test ‘has\nbeen added to, not substituted for,’ the traditional property-\nbased understanding of the Fourth Amendment.” Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting United States v. Jones, 565\nU. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8)). I would therefore find\nthis a more difficult case if it were established that prop-\n2                FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nerty law did not give petitioner’s cotenant the right to admit\nvisitors over petitioner’s objection. That difficulty does not\narise, however, because the authorities cited by the ami-\ncus association fail to establish that a guest would commit\na trespass if one of two joint tenants invited the guest to\nenter and the other tenant forbade the guest to do so.\nIndeed, what limited authority there is on the subject\npoints to the opposite conclusion.

I write sepa-\nrately to make clear the extent of my disagreement with\nRandolph.\n   I dissented in Randolph because the facts of that case\ndid not implicate a Fourth Amendment search and never\nshould have been analyzed as such. Id., at 145 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting) (“[N]o Fourth Amendment search occurs\nwhere . . . the spouse of an accused voluntarily leads the\npolice to potential evidence of wrongdoing by the ac-\ncused”). Instead of deciding the case on that narrow\nground, the majority in Randolph looked to “widely shared\nsocial expectations” to resolve whether the wife’s consent\nto a search should control over her husband’s objection.\nId., at 111. I find no support for that novel analytical\napproach in the Fourth Amendment’s text or history, or in\nthis Court’s jurisprudence. See id., at 128–131 (ROBERTS,\nC. J., dissenting). Accordingly, given a blank slate, I\nwould analyze this case consistent with THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE’s dissent in Randolph: “A warrantless search is\nreasonable if police obtain the voluntary consent of a\nperson authorized to give it.” Id., at 128. That is because\n“[c]o-occupants have ‘assumed the risk that one of their\nnumber might permit [a] common area to be searched.’ ”\nIbid. (quoting United States v. Matlock, 415 U.

This Court has read these com-\nplementary provisions to convey that, “whenever practica-\nble, [the police must] obtain advance judicial approval of\nsearches and seizures through the warrant procedure.”\nTerry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 20 (1968). The warrant re-\nquirement, Justice Jackson observed, ranks among the\n“fundamental distinctions between our form of govern-\nment, where officers are under the law, and the police-\nstate where they are the law.” Johnson v. United States,\n333 U. S. 10, 17 (1948). The Court has accordingly de-\nclared warrantless searches, in the main, “per se unrea-\nsonable.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 390 (1978)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see Groh v. Ramirez,\n540 U. S. 551, 559 (2004). If this main rule is to remain\nhardy, the Court has explained, exceptions to the warrant\nrequirement must be “few in number and carefully deline-\nated.” United States v. United States Dist. Court for East-\nern Dist. of Mich., 407 U. S. 297, 318 (1972); see Kyllo v.\n2               FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nUnited States, 533 U. S. 27, 31 (2001).\n   Instead of adhering to the warrant requirement, today’s\ndecision tells the police they may dodge it, nevermind\nample time to secure the approval of a neutral magistrate.\nSuppressing the warrant requirement, the Court shrinks\nto petite size our holding in Georgia v. Randolph, 547\nU. S. 103 (2006), that “a physically present inhabitant’s\nexpress refusal of consent to a police search [of his home]\nis dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a\nfellow occupant,” id., at 122–123.\n                               I\n  This case calls for a straightforward application of Ran-\ndolph. The police officers in Randolph were confronted\nwith a scenario closely resembling the situation presented\nhere. Once the police arrived at Janet and Scott Ran-\ndolph’s shared residence, Scott Randolph “unequivocally\nrefused” an officer’s request for permission to search their\nhome. Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 107 (2006).\nThe officer then asked Janet Randolph for her consent to\nthe search, which she “readily gave.” Ibid. The sequence\nhere was similar. After Walter Fernandez, while physi-\ncally present at his home, rebuffed the officers’ request to\ncome in, the police removed him from the premises and\nthen arrested him, albeit with cause to believe he had\nassaulted his cohabitant, Roxanne Rojas. At the time of\nthe arrest, Rojas said nothing to contradict Fernandez’\nrefusal. About an hour later, however, and with no at-\ntempt to obtain a search warrant, the police returned to\nthe apartment and prevailed upon Rojas to sign a consent\nform authorizing search of the premises. See infra, at 9,\nn. 5.\n  The circumstances triggering “the Fourth Amendment’s\ntraditional hostility to police entry into a home without a\nwarrant,” 547 U. S., at 126 (BREYER, J., concurring), are at\nleast as salient here as they were in Randolph. In both\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncases, “[t]he search at issue was a search solely for evi-\ndence”; “[t]he objecting party,” while on the premises,\n“made his objection [to police entry] known clearly and\ndirectly to the officers seeking to enter the [residence]”;\nand “the officers might easily have secured the premises\nand sought a warrant permitting them to enter.” Id., at\n125–126. Here, moreover, with the objector in custody,\nthere was scant danger to persons on the premises, or risk\nthat evidence might be destroyed or concealed, pending\nrequest for, and receipt of, a warrant. See id., at 126.\n  Despite these marked similarities, the Court removes\nthis case from Randolph’s ambit. The Court does so prin-\ncipally by seizing on the fact that Fernandez, unlike Scott\nRandolph, was no longer present and objecting when the\npolice obtained the co-occupant’s consent. Ante, at 8–9.\nBut Fernandez was present when he stated his objection\nto the would-be searchers in no uncertain terms. See App.\n6 (“You don’t have any right to come in here. I know my\nrights.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The officers\ncould scarcely have forgotten, one hour later, that Fernan-\ndez refused consent while physically present. That ex-\npress, on-premises objection should have been “dispositive\nas to him.” Randolph, 547 U. S., at 122.1\n  The Court tells us that the “widely shared social expec-\n——————\n   1 The Court is correct that this case does not involve a situation, al-\n\nluded to in Randolph, where “the police have removed the potentially\nobjecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible\nobjection.” Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 121 (2006). Here, as in\nRandolph, no one disputes that the police had probable cause to place\nthe objecting tenant under arrest. But had the objector’s arrest been\nillegal, Randolph suggested, the remaining occupant’s consent to the\nsearch would not suffice. The suggestion in Randolph, as the Court\nrecognizes, see ante, at 9–10, is at odds with today’s decision. For “[i]f\nthe police cannot prevent a co-tenant from objecting to a search through\narrest, surely they cannot arrest a co-tenant and then seek to ignore an\nobjection he has already made.” United States v. Murphy, 516 F. 3d\n1117, 1124–1125 (CA9 2008).\n4                FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ntations” and “customary social usage” undergirding Ran-\ndolph’s holding apply only when the objector remains\nphysically present. Ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Randolph’s discussion of social expectations,\nhowever, does not hinge on the objector’s physical pres-\nence vel non at the time of the search. “[W]hen people\nliving together disagree over the use of their common\nquarters,” Randolph observes, “a resolution must come\nthrough voluntary accommodation, not by appeals to\nauthority.” 547 U. S., at 113–114. See also id., at 114\n(“[T]here is no common understanding that one co-tenant\ngenerally has a right or authority to prevail over the ex-\npress wishes of another, whether the issue is the color of\nthe curtains or invitations to outsiders.”); id., at 115\n(“[T]he cooperative occupant’s invitation adds nothing to\nthe government’s side to counter the force of an objecting\nindividual’s claim to security against the government’s\nintrusion into his dwelling place.”).         Randolph thus\ntrained on whether a joint occupant had conveyed an\nobjection to a visitor’s entry, and did not suggest that the\nobjection could be ignored if the police reappeared post the\nobjector’s arrest.\n   A visitor might be less reluctant to enter over a joint\noccupant’s objection, the Court speculates, if that visitor\nknows the objector will not be there. See ante, at 11–12.\n“Only in a Hobbesian world,” however, “would one person’s\nsocial obligations to another be limited to what the other[,\nbecause of his presence,] is . . . able to enforce.” United\nStates v. Henderson, 536 F. 3d 776, 787 (CA7 2008) (Rov-\nner, J., dissenting). Such conjectures about social behav-\nior, at any rate, shed little light on the constitutionality of\nthis warrantless home search, given the marked distinc-\ntions between private interactions and police investiga-\ntions. Police, after all, have power no private person\nenjoys. They can, as this case illustrates, put a tenant in\nhandcuffs and remove him from the premises.\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                     5\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  Moreover, as the Court comprehended just last Term,\n“the background social norms that invite a visitor to the\nfront door do not invite him there to conduct a search.”\nFlorida v. Jardines, 569 U. S. 1, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 7).\nSimilarly here, even if shared tenancy were understood\nto entail the prospect of visits by unwanted social\ncallers while the objecting resident was gone, that un-\nwelcome visitor’s license would hardly include free rein to\nrummage through the dwelling in search of evidence and\ncontraband.2\n  Next, the Court cautions, applying Randolph to these\nfacts would pose “a plethora of practical problems.” Ante,\nat 12. For instance, the Court asks, must a cotenant’s\nobjection, once registered, be respected indefinitely? Yet it\nblinks reality to suppose that Fernandez, by withholding\nconsent, could stop police in their tracks eternally. Cf.\nante, at 12–13 (imagining an objector behind bars serving\nhis sentence, still refusing permission to search his\nresidence). To mount the prosecution eventuating in a\nconviction, of course, the State would first need to obtain\nincriminating evidence, and could get it easily simply by\napplying for a warrant. Warrant in police hands, the\nCourt’s practical problems disappear.\n——————\n  2 Remarkably, the Court thinks my disagreement with its account of\n\nthe applicable social norms distances me from Randolph’s understand-\ning of social expectations. See ante, at 11–12, n. 5. Quite the opposite.\nRandolph considered whether “customary social understanding accords\nthe consenting tenant authority powerful enough to prevail over the co-\ntenant’s objection”; social practice in such circumstances, the Court\nheld, provided no cause to depart from the “ ‘centuries-old principle of\nrespect for privacy of the home.’ ” 547 U. S., at 115, 121 (quoting Wilson\nv. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 610 (1999)). See also 547 U. S., at 115 (“Dis-\nputed permission is . . . no match for this central value of the Fourth\nAmendment . . . .”). I would so hold here. Today’s decision, by contrast,\nprovides police with ready means to nullify a cotenant’s objection, and\ntherefore “fails to come to grips with the reasoning of [Randolph].”\nAnte, at 12, n. 5.\n6                FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  Indeed, as the Court acknowledges, see ante, at 13–14,\nreading Randolph to require continuous physical presence\nposes administrative difficulties of its own. Does an occu-\npant’s refusal to consent lose force as soon as she absents\nherself from the doorstep, even if only for a moment? Are\nthe police free to enter the instant after the objector leaves\nthe door to retire for a nap, answer the phone, use the\nbathroom, or speak to another officer outside? See Brief\nfor Petitioner 28. Hypothesized practical considerations,\nin short, provide no cause for today’s drastic reduction of\nRandolph’s holding and attendant disregard for the war-\nrant requirement.\n                              II\n    In its zeal to diminish Randolph, today’s decision over-\nlooks the warrant requirement’s venerable role as the\n“bulwark of Fourth Amendment protection.” Franks v.\nDelaware, 438 U. S. 154, 164 (1978). Reducing Randolph\nto a “narrow exception,” the Court declares the main rule\nto be that “consent by one resident of jointly occupied\npremises is generally sufficient to justify a warrantless\nsearch.” Ante, at 7. That declaration has it backwards, for\nconsent searches themselves are a “ ‘jealously and care-\nfully drawn’ exception” to “the Fourth Amendment rule\nordinarily prohibiting the warrantless entry of a person’s\nhouse as unreasonable per se.” Randolph, 547 U. S., at\n109 (quoting Jones v. United States, 357 U. S. 493, 499\n(1958)). See also Jardines, 569 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)\n(“[W]hen it comes to the Fourth Amendment, the home is\nfirst among equals. At the Amendment’s ‘very core’ stands\n‘the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there\nbe free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.’ ”);\nPayton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 585 (1980) (“[T]he\nphysical entry of the home is the chief evil against which\n. . . the Fourth Amendment is directed.” (internal quota-\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                      7\n\n                         GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ntion marks omitted)).3\n   In this case, the police could readily have obtained a\nwarrant to search the shared residence.4 The Court does\n——————\n   3 I agree with the Court that when a sole owner or occupant consents\n\nto a search, the police can enter without obtaining a warrant. See ante,\nat 5–6. Where multiple persons occupy the premises, it is true, this\nCourt has upheld warrantless home searches based on one tenant’s\nconsent; those cases, however, did not involve, as this case does, an\noccupant who told the police they could not enter. See United States v.\nMatlock, 415 U. S. 164 (1974) (police relied on cotenant’s consent to\nsearch when other tenant had already been detained in a nearby squad\ncar); Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177 (1990) (same, when the other\ntenant was asleep in the bedroom). The Court’s rationale for allowing a\nsearch to proceed in those instances—that co-occupants “assum[e] the\nrisk that one of their number might permit the common area to be\nsearched,” Matlock, 415 U. S., at 171, n. 7—does not apply where, as\nhere, an occupant on the premises explicitly tells the police they cannot\nsearch his home sans warrant. See United States v. Henderson, 536\nF. 3d 776, 788 (CA7 2008) (Rovner, J., dissenting) (in such circum-\nstances, the objector “has not assumed the risk that his co-tenant may\nsubsequently admit the visitor, because all choice has been taken from\nhim in his involuntary removal from the premises”).\n   4 The Court dismisses as “beside the point” the undeniable fact that\n\nthe police easily could have obtained a warrant. Ante, at 6, n. 4. There\nmay be circumstances, the Court observes, in which the police, faced\nwith a cotenant’s objection, will lack probable cause to obtain a war-\nrant. That same argument was considered and rejected by the Court in\nRandolph, which recognized that “alternatives to disputed consent will\nnot always open the door to search for evidence that the police suspect\nis inside.” 547 U. S., at 120. Moreover, it is unlikely that police,\npossessing an objective basis to arrest an objecting tenant, will never-\ntheless lack probable cause to obtain a search warrant. Probable cause\nto arrest, I recognize, calls for a showing discrete from the showing\nneeded to establish probable cause to search a home. But “where, as\nhere, a suspect is arrested at or near his residence, it will often ‘be\npermissible to infer that the instrumentalities and fruits of th[e] crime\nare presently in that person’s residence.’ ” Brief for National Associa-\ntion of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 25 (quoting 2 W.\nLaFave, Search and Seizure §3.1(b) (5th ed. 2011)). And as the Court\nobserved in Randolph, if a warrant may be impeded by a tenant’s\nrefusal to consent, “[a] co-tenant acting on [her] own initiative may be\nable to deliver evidence to the police, and . . . tell the police what [s]he\n8                   FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nnot dispute this, but instead disparages the warrant re-\nquirement as inconvenient, burdensome, entailing delay\n“[e]ven with modern technological advances.” Ante, at 14.\nShut from the Court’s sight is the ease and speed with\nwhich search warrants nowadays can be obtained. See\nMissouri v. McNeely, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at\n11) (observing that technology now “allow[s] for the more\nexpeditious processing of warrant applications,” and citing\nstate statutes permitting warrants to be obtained “remotely\nthrough various means, including telephonic or radio\ncommunication, electronic communication . . . , and video\nconferencing”). See also Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 29 (describ-\ning California’s procedures for electronic warrant applica-\ntions). With these developments in view, dilution of the\nwarrant requirement should be vigilantly resisted.\n   Although the police have probable cause and could\nobtain a warrant with dispatch, if they can gain the con-\nsent of someone other than the suspect, why should the\nlaw insist on the formality of a warrant? Because the\nFramers saw the neutral magistrate as an essential part\nof the criminal process shielding all of us, good or bad,\nsaint or sinner, from unchecked police activity. See, e.g.,\nJohnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 13–14 (1948) (“The\npoint of the Fourth Amendment . . . is not that it denies\nlaw enforcement the support of the usual inferences which\nreasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection con-\nsists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a\nneutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged\nby the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise\nof ferreting out crime.”). “The investigation of crime,” of\ncourse, “would always be simplified if warrants were\nunnecessary.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 393\n—————— \n\nknows, for use before a magistrate in getting a warrant.” 547 U. S., at\n\n116 (citation omitted).\n\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                       9\n\n                         GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n(1978). “But the Fourth Amendment,” the Court has long\nrecognized, “reflects the view of those who wrote the Bill of\nRights that the privacy of a person’s home and property\nmay not be totally sacrificed in the name of maximum\nsimplicity in enforcement of the criminal law.” Ibid. See\nalso Randolph, 547 U. S., at 115, n. 5 (“A generalized\ninterest in expedient law enforcement cannot, without\nmore, justify a warrantless search.”).\n  A final word is in order about the Court’s reference to\nRojas’ autonomy, which, in its view, is best served by\nallowing her consent to trump an abusive cohabitant’s\nobjection. See ante, at 15 (“Denying someone in Rojas’\nposition the right to allow the police to enter her home\nwould also show disrespect for her independence.”).5\nRojas’ situation is not distinguishable from Janet Ran-\ndolph’s in this regard. If a person’s health and safety are\nthreatened by a domestic abuser, exigent circumstances\nwould justify immediate removal of the abuser from the\n——————\n  5 Although   the validity of Rojas’ consent is not before us, the record\noffers cause to doubt that her agreement to the search was, in fact, an\nunpressured exercise of self-determination. At the evidentiary hearing\non Fernandez’ motion to suppress, Rojas testified that the police, upon\nreturning to the residence about an hour after Fernandez’ arrest, began\nquestioning her four-year-old son without her permission. App. 81, 93.\nRojas asked to remain present during that questioning, but the police\nofficer told her that their investigation was “going to determine whether\nor not we take your kids from you right now or not.” Id., at 93. See\nalso ibid. (“I felt like [the police] were going to take my kids away from\nme.”). Rojas thus maintained that she felt “pressured” into giving\nconsent. Id., at 93–94. See also id., at 93 (“I felt like I had no rights.”).\nAfter about 20 or 30 minutes, Rojas acceded to the officer’s request that\nshe sign a consent form. Rojas testified that she “didn’t want to sign\n[the form],” but did so because she “just wanted it to just end.” Id., at\n100.\n   The trial court found Rojas’ testimony at the suppression hearing\n“believable at points and unbelievable at other points,” and concluded\nthat the police conduct did not amount to “duress or coercion.” Id., at\n152. The trial court agreed, however, that Rojas “may have felt pres-\nsured.” Ibid.\n10                  FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\npremises, as happened here. Cf. Randolph, 547 U. S., at\n118 (“[T]his case has no bearing on the capacity of the\npolice to protect domestic victims. . . . No question has\nbeen raised, or reasonably could be, about the authority of\nthe police to enter a dwelling to protect a resident from\ndomestic violence . . . .”). See also Brigham City v. Stuart,\n547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006) (“[L]aw enforcement officers may\nenter a home without a warrant to render emergency\nassistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant\nfrom imminent injury.”). Domestic abuse is indeed “a\nserious problem in the United States,” Randolph, 547\nU. S., at 117 (citing statistics); appropriate policy responses\nto this scourge may include fostering effective counseling,\nproviding public information about, and ready access to,\nprotective orders, and enforcing such orders diligently.6\nAs the Court understood in Randolph, however, the spec-\nter of domestic abuse hardly necessitates the diminution\nof the Fourth Amendment rights at stake here.\n                        *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, I would honor the Fourth\nAmendment’s warrant requirement and hold that Fernan-\ndez’ objection to the search did not become null upon his\narrest and removal from the scene. “There is every reason\nto conclude that securing a warrant was entirely feasible\nin this case, and no reason to contract the Fourth Amend-\nment’s dominion.” Kentucky v.

Argued November 13, 2013—Decided February 25, 2014\nPolice officers observed a suspect in a violent robbery run into an\n  apartment building, and heard screams coming from one of the\n  apartments. They knocked on the apartment door, which was an-\n  swered by Roxanne Rojas, who appeared to be battered and bleeding.\n  When the officers asked her to step out of the apartment so that they\n  could conduct a protective sweep, petitioner came to the door and ob-\n  jected. Suspecting that he had assaulted Rojas, the officers removed\n  petitioner from the apartment and placed him under arrest. He was\n  then identified as the perpetrator in the earlier robbery and taken to\n  the police station. An officer later returned to the apartment and, af-\n  ter obtaining Rojas’ oral and written consent, searched the premises,\n  where he found several items linking petitioner to the robbery. The\n  trial court denied petitioner’s motion to suppress that evidence, and\n  he was convicted. The California Court of Appeal affirmed. It held\n  that because petitioner was not present when Rojas consented to the\n  search, the exception to permissible warrantless consent searches of\n  jointly occupied premises that arises when one of the occupants pre-\n  sent objects to the search, Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, did not\n  apply, and therefore, petitioner’s suppression motion had been\n  properly denied.\nHeld: Randolph does not extend to this situation, where Rojas’ consent\n was provided well after petitioner had been removed from their\n apartment. Pp. 5–15.\n    (a) Consent searches are permissible warrantless searches,\n Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 228, 231–232, and are\n clearly reasonable when the consent comes from the sole occupant of\n the premises. When multiple occupants are involved, the rule ex-\n tends to the search of the premises or effects of an absent, noncon-\n2                      FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    senting occupant so long as “the consent of one who possesses com-\n    mon authority over [the] premises or effects” is obtained. United\n    States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164, 170. However, when “a physically\n    present inhabitan[t]” refuses to consent, that refusal “is dispositive as\n    to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant.” Randolph,\n    547 U. S., at 122–123. A controlling factor in Randolph was the ob-\n    jecting occupant’s physical presence. See, e.g., id., at 106, 108, 109,\n    114. Pp. 5–9.\n       (b) Petitioner contends that, though he was not present when Rojas\n    consented, Randolph nevertheless controls, but neither of his argu-\n    ments is sound. Pp. 9–14.\n          (1) He first argues that his absence should not matter since it oc-\n    curred only because the police had taken him away. Dictum in Ran-\n    dolph suggesting that consent by one occupant might not be sufficient\n    if “there is evidence that the police have removed the potentially ob-\n    jecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible\n    objection,” 547 U. S., at 121, is best understood to refer to situations\n    in which the removal of the potential objector is not objectively rea-\n    sonable. Petitioner does not contest the fact that the police had rea-\n    sonable grounds for his removal or the existence of probable cause for\n    his arrest. He was thus in the same position as an occupant absent\n    for any other reason. Pp. 9–10.\n          (2) Petitioner also argues that the objection he made while at the\n    threshold remained effective until he changed his mind and withdrew\n    it. This is inconsistent with Randolph in at least two important\n    ways. It cannot be squared with the “widely shared social expecta-\n    tions” or “customary social usage” upon which Randolph’s holding\n    was based. 547 U. S., at 111, 121. It also creates the sort of practical\n    complications that Randolph sought to avoid by adopting a “formal-\n    is[tic]” rule, id., at 121, e.g., requiring that the scope of an objection’s\n    duration and the procedures necessary to register a continuing objec-\n    tion be defined. Pp. 10–14.\n       (c) Petitioner claims that his expansive interpretation of Randolph\n    would not hamper law enforcement because in most cases where of-\n    ficers have probable cause to arrest a physically present objector they\n    also have probable cause to obtain a warrant to search the premises\n    that the objector does not want them to enter. But he misunder-\n    stands the constitutional status of consent searches, which are per-\n    missible irrespective of the availability of a warrant. Requiring offic-\n    ers to obtain a warrant when a warrantless search is justified may\n    interfere with law enforcement strategies and impose an unmerited\n    burden on the person willing to consent to an immediate search.\n    Pp. 14–15.\n208 Cal.

See United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164\n(1974). In Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103 (2006), we\nrecognized a narrow exception to this rule, holding that\nthe consent of one occupant is insufficient when another\noccupant is present and objects to the search. In this case,\nwe consider whether Randolph applies if the objecting\noccupant is absent when another occupant consents. Our\nopinion in Randolph took great pains to emphasize that its\nholding was limited to situations in which the objecting\noccupant is physically present.

After observing Abel Lopez cash a check,\npetitioner Walter Fernandez approached Lopez and asked\nabout the neighborhood in which he lived. When Lopez\nresponded that he was from Mexico, Fernandez laughed\nand told Lopez that he was in territory ruled by the\n“D.F.S.,” i.e., the “Drifters” gang. App. 4–5. Petitioner\nthen pulled out a knife and pointed it at Lopez’ chest.\nLopez raised his hand in self-defense, and petitioner cut\nhim on the wrist.\n    Lopez ran from the scene and called 911 for help, but\npetitioner whistled, and four men emerged from a nearby\napartment building and attacked Lopez. After knocking\nhim to the ground, they hit and kicked him and took his\ncell phone and his wallet, which contained $400 in cash.\n    A police dispatch reported the incident and mentioned\nthe possibility of gang involvement, and two Los Angeles\npolice officers, Detective Clark and Officer Cirrito, drove\nto an alley frequented by members of the Drifters. A man\nwho appeared scared walked by the officers and said:\n“ ‘[T]he guy is in the apartment.’ ” Id., at 5. The officers\nthen observed a man run through the alley and into the\nbuilding to which the man was pointing. A minute or two\nlater, the officers heard sounds of screaming and fighting\ncoming from that building.\n    After backup arrived, the officers knocked on the door of\nthe apartment unit from which the screams had been\nheard. Roxanne Rojas answered the door. She was hold-\ning a baby and appeared to be crying. Her face was red,\nand she had a large bump on her nose. The officers also\nsaw blood on her shirt and hand from what appeared to be\na fresh injury. Rojas told the police that she had been in a\nfight. Officer Cirrito asked if anyone else was in the\napartment, and Rojas said that her 4-year-old son was the\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

I know my\nrights.’ ” Id., at 6. Suspecting that petitioner had assaulted\nRojas, the officers removed him from the apartment\nand then placed him under arrest. Lopez identified peti-\ntioner as his initial attacker, and petitioner was taken to\nthe police station for booking.\n   Approximately one hour after petitioner’s arrest, Detec-\ntive Clark returned to the apartment and informed Rojas\nthat petitioner had been arrested. Detective Clark re-\nquested and received both oral and written consent from\nRojas to search the premises.2 In the apartment, the\npolice found Drifters gang paraphernalia, a butterfly\nknife, clothing worn by the robbery suspect, and ammuni-\ntion.

In suggesting that Rojas’ consent was coerced, the dissent\nrecites portions of Rojas’ testimony from the suppression hearing that\nthe trial judge appears to have rejected. Ibid. Similarly, the jury\nplainly did not find Rojas to be credible. At trial, she testified for the\ndefense and told the jury, among other things, that the wounds ob-\nserved by the officers who came to her door were not inflicted by peti-\ntioner but by a woman looking for petitioner during a fight. 208 Cal.\nApp. 4th 100, 109–110, 145 Cal.

King, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 5). Our cases establish that a warrant is\ngenerally required for a search of a home, Brigham City v.\nStuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006), but “the ultimate touch-\nstone of the Fourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness,’ ” ibid.;\nsee also Michigan v. Fisher, 558 U. S. 45, 47 (2009) ( per\ncuriam). And certain categories of permissible warrant-\nless searches have long been recognized.\n   Consent searches occupy one of these categories. “Con-\nsent searches are part of the standard investigatory\ntechniques of law enforcement agencies” and are “a con-\nstitutionally permissible and wholly legitimate aspect of\neffective police activity.” Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412\nU. S. 218, 228, 231–232 (1973). It would be unreasonable—\nindeed, absurd—to require police officers to obtain a war-\nrant when the sole owner or occupant of a house or apart-\nment voluntarily consents to a search. The owner of a\nhome has a right to allow others to enter and examine the\npremises, and there is no reason why the owner should not\nbe permitted to extend this same privilege to police officers\nif that is the owner’s choice. Where the owner believes\n\n—————— \n\nsome objective manifestation that he has changed his position and no \n\nlonger objects”). \n\n6                   FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat he or she is under suspicion, the owner may want the\npolice to search the premises so that their suspicions are\ndispelled. This may be particularly important where the\nowner has a strong interest in the apprehension of the\nperpetrator of a crime and believes that the suspicions of\nthe police are deflecting the course of their investigation.\nAn owner may want the police to search even where they\nlack probable cause, and if a warrant were always re-\nquired, this could not be done. And even where the police\ncould establish probable cause, requiring a warrant de-\nspite the owner’s consent would needlessly inconvenience\neveryone involved—not only the officers and the magis-\ntrate but also the occupant of the premises, who would\ngenerally either be compelled or would feel a need to stay\nuntil the search was completed. Michigan v. Summers,\n452 U. S. 692, 701 (1981).4\n   While it is clear that a warrantless search is reasonable\nwhen the sole occupant of a house or apartment consents,\nwhat happens when there are two or more occupants?\nMust they all consent? Must they all be asked? Is consent\nby one occupant enough? The Court faced that problem 40\nyears ago in United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164\n(1974).\n   In that case, Matlock and a woman named Graff were\nliving together in a house that was also occupied by several\nof Graff ’s siblings and by her mother, who had rented\nthe house. While in the front yard of the house, Matlock\nwas arrested for bank robbery and was placed in a squad\ncar. Although the police could have easily asked him for\n——————\n  4 A main theme of the dissent is that the police in this case had prob-\n\nable cause to search the apartment and therefore could have obtained a\nwarrant. Of course, this will not always be so in cases in which one\noccupant consents to a search and the other objects, and the dissent\ndoes not suggest that a warrant should be required only when probable\ncause is present. As a result, the dissent’s repeated references to the\navailability of a warrant in this case are beside the point.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconsent to search the room that he and Graff shared, they\ndid not do so. Instead, they knocked on the door and\nobtained Graff ’s permission to search. The search yielded\nincriminating evidence, which the defendant sought to\nsuppress, but this Court held that Graff ’s consent justified\nthe warrantless search. As the Court put it, “the consent\nof one who possesses common authority over premises or\neffects is valid as against the absent, nonconsenting per-\nson with whom that authority is shared.” Id., at 170.\n  In Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177 (1990), the Court\nreaffirmed and extended the Matlock holding. In Rodri-\nguez, a woman named Fischer told police officers that she\nhad been assaulted by Rodriguez in what she termed “ ‘our’\napartment.” 497 U. S., at 179. She also informed the\nofficers that Rodriguez was asleep in the apartment, and\nshe then accompanied the officers to that unit. When they\narrived, the officers could have knocked on the door and\nawakened Rodriguez, and had they done so, Rodriguez\nmight well have surrendered at the door and objected to\nthe officers’ entry. Instead, Fischer unlocked the door, the\nofficers entered without a warrant, and they saw drug\nparaphernalia and containers filled with white powder in\nplain view.\n  After the search, the police learned that Fischer no\nlonger resided at the apartment, and this Court held that\nshe did not have common authority over the premises at\nthe time in question. The Court nevertheless held that\nthe warrantless entry was lawful because the police rea-\nsonably believed that Fischer was a resident. Id., at 188–\n189.\n                               B\n  While consent by one resident of jointly occupied prem-\nises is generally sufficient to justify a warrantless search,\nwe recognized a narrow exception to this rule in Georgia v.\nRandolph, 547 U. S. 103 (2006). In that case, police offi-\n8                FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncers responded to the Randolphs’ home after receiving a\nreport of a domestic dispute. When the officers arrived,\nJanet Randolph informed the officers that her estranged\nhusband, Scott Randolph, was a cocaine user and that\nthere were “items of drug evidence” in the house. Id., at\n107 (internal quotation marks omitted). The officers first\nasked Scott for consent to search, but he “unequivocally\nrefused.” Ibid. The officers then turned to Janet, and she\nconsented to the search, which produced evidence that was\nlater used to convict Scott for possession of cocaine.\n   Without questioning the prior holdings in Matlock and\nRodriguez, this Court held that Janet Randolph’s consent\nwas insufficient under the circumstances to justify the\nwarrantless search. The Court reiterated the proposition\nthat a person who shares a residence with others assumes\nthe risk that “any one of them may admit visitors, with\nthe consequence that a guest obnoxious to one may never-\ntheless be admitted in his absence by another.” 547 U. S.,\nat 111. But the Court held that “a physically present\ninhabitant’s express refusal of consent to a police search\n[of his home] is dispositive as to him, regardless of the\nconsent of a fellow occupant.” Id., at 122–123 (emphasis\nadded).\n   The Court’s opinion went to great lengths to make clear\nthat its holding was limited to situations in which the\nobjecting occupant is present. Again and again, the opin-\nion of the Court stressed this controlling factor. See id., at\n106 (“present at the scene”); ibid. (“physically present”);\nid., at 108 (“a co-tenant who is present”); id., at 109\n(“physically present”); id., at 114 (“a present and objecting\nco-tenant”); id., at 119 (a co-tenant “standing at the door\nand expressly refusing consent”); id., at 120 (“a physically\npresent resident”), id., at 121 (“a physically present fellow\ntenant objects”); ibid. (“[A] potential defendant with self-\ninterest in objecting is at the door and objects”); id., at 122\n(“[A] physically present inhabitant’s express refusal of\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconsent to a police search is dispositive as to him”). The\nCourt’s opinion could hardly have been clearer on this\npoint, and the separate opinion filed by JUSTICE BREYER,\nwhose vote was decisive, was equally unambiguous. See\nid., at 126 (concurring) (“The Court’s opinion does not\napply where the objector is not present ‘and object[ing]’ ”).\n                            III\n   In this case, petitioner was not present when Rojas\nconsented, but petitioner still contends that Randolph is\ncontrolling. He advances two main arguments. First, he\nclaims that his absence should not matter since he was\nabsent only because the police had taken him away.\nSecond, he maintains that it was sufficient that he objected\nto the search while he was still present. Such an objec-\ntion, he says, should remain in effect until the objecting\nparty “no longer wishes to keep the police out of his home.”\nBrief for Petitioner 8. Neither of these arguments is\nsound.\n                             A\n   We first consider the argument that the presence of the\nobjecting occupant is not necessary when the police are\nresponsible for his absence. In Randolph, the Court sug-\ngested in dictum that consent by one occupant might not\nbe sufficient if “there is evidence that the police have\nremoved the potentially objecting tenant from the en-\ntrance for the sake of avoiding a possible objection.” 547\nU. S., at 121. We do not believe the statement should be\nread to suggest that improper motive may invalidate\nobjectively justified removal. Hence, it does not govern\nhere.\n   The Randolph dictum is best understood not to require\nan inquiry into the subjective intent of officers who detain\nor arrest a potential objector but instead to refer to situa-\ntions in which the removal of the potential objector is not\n10              FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nobjectively reasonable. As petitioner acknowledges, see\nBrief for Petitioner 25, our Fourth Amendment cases\n“have repeatedly rejected” a subjective approach.\nBrigham City, 547 U. S., at 404 (alteration and internal\nquotation marks omitted). “Indeed, we have never held,\noutside limited contexts such as an ‘inventory search or\nadministrative inspection . . . , that an officer’s motive\ninvalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the\nFourth Amendment.’ ” King, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10).\n  Petitioner does not claim that the Randolph Court\nmeant to break from this consistent practice, and we do\nnot think that it did. And once it is recognized that the\ntest is one of objective reasonableness, petitioner’s argu-\nment collapses. He does not contest the fact that the\npolice had reasonable grounds for removing him from the\napartment so that they could speak with Rojas, an appar-\nent victim of domestic violence, outside of petitioner’s\npotentially intimidating presence. In fact, he does not\neven contest the existence of probable cause to place him\nunder arrest. We therefore hold that an occupant who is\nabsent due to a lawful detention or arrest stands in the\nsame shoes as an occupant who is absent for any other\nreason.\n  This conclusion does not “make a mockery of Randolph,”\nas petitioner protests. Brief for Petitioner 9. It simply\naccepts Randolph on its own terms. The Randolph hold-\ning unequivocally requires the presence of the objecting\noccupant in every situation other than the one mentioned\nin the dictum discussed above.\n                             B\n  This brings us to petitioner’s second argument, viz., that\nhis objection, made at the threshold of the premises that\nthe police wanted to search, remained effective until he\nchanged his mind and withdrew his objection. This argu-\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nment is inconsistent with Randolph’s reasoning in at least\ntwo important ways. First, the argument cannot be\nsquared with the “widely shared social expectations” or\n“customary social usage” upon which the Randolph hold-\ning was based. See 547 U. S., at 111, 121. Explaining\nwhy consent by one occupant could not override an objec-\ntion by a physically present occupant, the Randolph Court\nstated:\n     “[I]t is fair to say that a caller standing at the door of\n     shared premises would have no confidence that one\n     occupant’s invitation was a sufficiently good reason to\n     enter when a fellow tenant stood there saying, ‘stay\n     out.’ Without some very good reason, no sensible per-\n     son would go inside under those conditions.” Id., at\n     113.\n   It seems obvious that the calculus of this hypothetical\ncaller would likely be quite different if the objecting tenant\nwas not standing at the door. When the objecting occu-\npant is standing at the threshold saying “stay out,” a\nfriend or visitor invited to enter by another occupant can\nexpect at best an uncomfortable scene and at worst vio-\nlence if he or she tries to brush past the objector. But\nwhen the objector is not on the scene (and especially when\nit is known that the objector will not return during the\ncourse of the visit), the friend or visitor is much more\nlikely to accept the invitation to enter.5 Thus, petitioner’s\n——————\n  5 Although the dissent intimates that “customary social usage” goes\n\nfurther than this, see post, at 4, the dissent provides no support for this\ndoubtful proposition. In the present case, for example, suppose that\nRojas had called a relative, a friend, a supportive neighbor, or a person\nwho works for a group that aids battered women and had invited that\nindividual to enter and examine the premises while petitioner was in\njail. Would any of those invitees have felt that it was beyond Rojas’\nauthority to extend that invitation over petitioner’s objection?\n  Instead of attempting to show that such persons would have felt it\nimproper to accept this invitation, the dissent quickly changes the\n12                  FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nargument is inconsistent with Randolph’s reasoning.\n   Second, petitioner’s argument would create the very sort\nof practical complications that Randolph sought to avoid.\nThe Randolph Court recognized that it was adopting a\n“formalis[tic]” rule, but it did so in the interests of “simple\nclarity” and administrability. Id., at 121, 122.\n   The rule that petitioner would have us adopt would\nproduce a plethora of practical problems. For one thing,\nthere is the question of duration. Petitioner argues that\nan objection, once made, should last until it is withdrawn\nby the objector, but such a rule would be unreasonable.\nSuppose that a husband and wife owned a house as joint\ntenants and that the husband, after objecting to a search\nof the house, was convicted and sentenced to a 15-year\nprison term. Under petitioner’s proposed rule, the wife\nwould be unable to consent to a search of the house 10\nyears after the date on which her husband objected. We\nrefuse to stretch Randolph to such strange lengths.\n   Nor are we persuaded to hold that an objection lasts for\na “reasonable” time. “[I]t is certainly unusual for this\nCourt to set forth precise time limits governing police\naction,” Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. 98, 110 (2010), and\nwhat interval of time would be reasonable in this context?\nA week? A month? A year? Ten years?\n   Petitioner’s rule would also require the police and ulti-\nmately the courts to determine whether, after the passage\nof time, an objector still had “common authority” over the\npremises, and this would often be a tricky question. Sup-\npose that an incarcerated objector and a consenting co-\noccupant were joint tenants on a lease. If the objector,\n——————\nsubject and says that “conjectures about social behavior shed little light\non the constitutionality” of the search in this case. Post, at 4. But the\nholding in Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103 (2006), was based on\n“widely shared social expectations” and “customary social usage.” See\nId., at 111, 121. Thus, the dissent simply fails to come to grips with the\nreasoning of the precedent on which it relies.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nafter incarceration, stopped paying rent, would he still\nhave “common authority,” and would his objection retain\nits force? Would it be enough that his name remained\non the lease? Would the result be different if the object-\ning and consenting lessees had an oral month-to-month\ntenancy?\n   Another problem concerns the procedure needed to\nregister a continuing objection. Would it be necessary for\nan occupant to object while police officers are at the door?\nIf presence at the time of consent is not needed, would an\noccupant have to be present at the premises when the\nobjection was made? Could an objection be made pre-\nemptively? Could a person like Scott Randolph, suspect-\ning that his estranged wife might invite the police to view\nhis drug stash and paraphernalia, register an objection in\nadvance? Could this be done by posting a sign in front of\nthe house? Could a standing objection be registered by\nserving notice on the chief of police?\n   Finally, there is the question of the particular law en-\nforcement officers who would be bound by an objection.\nWould this set include just the officers who were present\nwhen the objection was made? Would it also apply to\nother officers working on the same investigation? Would\nit extend to officers who were unaware of the objection?\nHow about officers assigned to different but arguably\nrelated cases? Would it be limited by law enforcement\nagency?\n   If Randolph is taken at its word—that it applies only\nwhen the objector is standing in the door saying “stay out”\nwhen officers propose to make a consent search—all of\nthese problems disappear.\n   In response to these arguments, petitioner argues that\nRandolph’s requirement of physical presence is not with-\nout its own ambiguity. And we acknowledge that if, as we\nconclude, Randolph requires presence on the premises to\nbe searched, there may be cases in which the outer bound-\n14              FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nary of the premises is disputed. The Court confronted a\nsimilar problem last Term in Bailey v. United States, 568\nU. S. ___ (2013), but despite arguments similar to those\nnow offered by petitioner, the Court adopted a rule that\napplies only when the affected individual is near the\npremises being searched. Having held that a premises\nrule is workable in that context, we see no ground for\nreaching a different conclusion here.\n                             C\n   Petitioner argues strenuously that his expansive inter-\npretation of Randolph would not hamper law enforcement\nbecause in most cases where officers have probable cause\nto arrest a physically present objector they also have\nprobable cause to search the premises that the objector\ndoes not want them to enter, see Brief for Petitioner 20–\n23, but this argument misunderstands the constitutional\nstatus of consent searches. A warrantless consent search\nis reasonable and thus consistent with the Fourth\nAmendment irrespective of the availability of a warrant.\nEven with modern technological advances, the warrant\nprocedure imposes burdens on the officers who wish to\nsearch, the magistrate who must review the warrant\napplication, and the party willing to give consent. When\na warrantless search is justified, requiring the police to\nobtain a warrant may “unjustifiably interfer[e] with legit-\nimate law enforcement strategies.” King, 563 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 13). Such a requirement may also impose an\nunmerited burden on the person who consents to an im-\nmediate search, since the warrant application procedure\nentails delay. Putting the exception the Court adopted in\nRandolph to one side, the lawful occupant of a house or\napartment should have the right to invite the police to\nenter the dwelling and conduct a search. Any other rule\nwould trample on the rights of the occupant who is willing\nto consent. Such an occupant may want the police to\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

In this case, for example, the search\nresulted in the discovery and removal of a sawed-off shot-\ngun to which Rojas’ 4-year-old son had access.\n  Denying someone in Rojas’ position the right to allow\nthe police to enter her home would also show disrespect for\nher independence.

Randolph,\n547 U. S. 103 (2006), was wrongly decided. I nonetheless\njoin the Court’s opinion because it is a faithful application\nof Randolph. I write separately to address the argument\nthat the search of petitioner’s shared apartment violated\nthe Fourth Amendment because he had a right under\nproperty law to exclude the police. See Brief for National\nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae\n17–23. The United States dismisses that argument,\npointing to our statement in United States v. Matlock, 415\nU. S. 164, 171, n. 7 (1974), that a cotenant’s ability to con-\nsent to a search “does not rest upon the law of property,\nwith its attendant historical and legal refinements.”\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23.\n   I do not think the argument can be so easily dismissed.\nTo be sure, under Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347\n(1967), “property rights ‘are not the sole measure of\nFourth Amendment violations.’ ” Florida v. Jardines, 569\nU. S. 1, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3). But as we have recently\nmade clear, “[t]he Katz reasonable-expectations test ‘has\nbeen added to, not substituted for,’ the traditional property-\nbased understanding of the Fourth Amendment.” Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting United States v. Jones, 565\nU. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8)). I would therefore find\nthis a more difficult case if it were established that prop-\n2                FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nerty law did not give petitioner’s cotenant the right to admit\nvisitors over petitioner’s objection. That difficulty does not\narise, however, because the authorities cited by the ami-\ncus association fail to establish that a guest would commit\na trespass if one of two joint tenants invited the guest to\nenter and the other tenant forbade the guest to do so.\nIndeed, what limited authority there is on the subject\npoints to the opposite conclusion. See, e.g., 86 C. J. S.,\nTenancy in Common §144, p. 354 (2006) (a licensee of one\ntenant “is not liable in trespass to nonconsenting coten-\nants”); Dinsmore v. Renfroe, 66 Cal.

Tiffany, Real Property §457, p. 274 (3d\ned. 1939) (endorsing the opposite view but acknowledging\nthat “there is little authority” on the question).

Randolph, 547 U. S. 103 (2006). I write sepa-\nrately to make clear the extent of my disagreement with\nRandolph.\n   I dissented in Randolph because the facts of that case\ndid not implicate a Fourth Amendment search and never\nshould have been analyzed as such. Id., at 145 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting) (“[N]o Fourth Amendment search occurs\nwhere . . . the spouse of an accused voluntarily leads the\npolice to potential evidence of wrongdoing by the ac-\ncused”). Instead of deciding the case on that narrow\nground, the majority in Randolph looked to “widely shared\nsocial expectations” to resolve whether the wife’s consent\nto a search should control over her husband’s objection.\nId., at 111. I find no support for that novel analytical\napproach in the Fourth Amendment’s text or history, or in\nthis Court’s jurisprudence. See id., at 128–131 (ROBERTS,\nC. J., dissenting). Accordingly, given a blank slate, I\nwould analyze this case consistent with THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE’s dissent in Randolph: “A warrantless search is\nreasonable if police obtain the voluntary consent of a\nperson authorized to give it.” Id., at 128. That is because\n“[c]o-occupants have ‘assumed the risk that one of their\nnumber might permit [a] common area to be searched.’ ”\nIbid. (quoting United States v. Matlock, 415 U.

This Court has read these com-\nplementary provisions to convey that, “whenever practica-\nble, [the police must] obtain advance judicial approval of\nsearches and seizures through the warrant procedure.”\nTerry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 20 (1968). The warrant re-\nquirement, Justice Jackson observed, ranks among the\n“fundamental distinctions between our form of govern-\nment, where officers are under the law, and the police-\nstate where they are the law.” Johnson v. United States,\n333 U. S. 10, 17 (1948). The Court has accordingly de-\nclared warrantless searches, in the main, “per se unrea-\nsonable.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 390 (1978)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see Groh v. Ramirez,\n540 U. S. 551, 559 (2004). If this main rule is to remain\nhardy, the Court has explained, exceptions to the warrant\nrequirement must be “few in number and carefully deline-\nated.” United States v. United States Dist. Court for East-\nern Dist. of Mich., 407 U. S. 297, 318 (1972); see Kyllo v.\n2               FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nUnited States, 533 U. S. 27, 31 (2001).\n   Instead of adhering to the warrant requirement, today’s\ndecision tells the police they may dodge it, nevermind\nample time to secure the approval of a neutral magistrate.\nSuppressing the warrant requirement, the Court shrinks\nto petite size our holding in Georgia v. Randolph, 547\nU. S. 103 (2006), that “a physically present inhabitant’s\nexpress refusal of consent to a police search [of his home]\nis dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a\nfellow occupant,” id., at 122–123.\n                               I\n  This case calls for a straightforward application of Ran-\ndolph. The police officers in Randolph were confronted\nwith a scenario closely resembling the situation presented\nhere. Once the police arrived at Janet and Scott Ran-\ndolph’s shared residence, Scott Randolph “unequivocally\nrefused” an officer’s request for permission to search their\nhome. Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 107 (2006).\nThe officer then asked Janet Randolph for her consent to\nthe search, which she “readily gave.” Ibid. The sequence\nhere was similar. After Walter Fernandez, while physi-\ncally present at his home, rebuffed the officers’ request to\ncome in, the police removed him from the premises and\nthen arrested him, albeit with cause to believe he had\nassaulted his cohabitant, Roxanne Rojas. At the time of\nthe arrest, Rojas said nothing to contradict Fernandez’\nrefusal. About an hour later, however, and with no at-\ntempt to obtain a search warrant, the police returned to\nthe apartment and prevailed upon Rojas to sign a consent\nform authorizing search of the premises. See infra, at 9,\nn. 5.\n  The circumstances triggering “the Fourth Amendment’s\ntraditional hostility to police entry into a home without a\nwarrant,” 547 U. S., at 126 (BREYER, J., concurring), are at\nleast as salient here as they were in Randolph. In both\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncases, “[t]he search at issue was a search solely for evi-\ndence”; “[t]he objecting party,” while on the premises,\n“made his objection [to police entry] known clearly and\ndirectly to the officers seeking to enter the [residence]”;\nand “the officers might easily have secured the premises\nand sought a warrant permitting them to enter.” Id., at\n125–126. Here, moreover, with the objector in custody,\nthere was scant danger to persons on the premises, or risk\nthat evidence might be destroyed or concealed, pending\nrequest for, and receipt of, a warrant. See id., at 126.\n  Despite these marked similarities, the Court removes\nthis case from Randolph’s ambit. The Court does so prin-\ncipally by seizing on the fact that Fernandez, unlike Scott\nRandolph, was no longer present and objecting when the\npolice obtained the co-occupant’s consent. Ante, at 8–9.\nBut Fernandez was present when he stated his objection\nto the would-be searchers in no uncertain terms. See App.\n6 (“You don’t have any right to come in here. I know my\nrights.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The officers\ncould scarcely have forgotten, one hour later, that Fernan-\ndez refused consent while physically present. That ex-\npress, on-premises objection should have been “dispositive\nas to him.” Randolph, 547 U. S., at 122.1\n  The Court tells us that the “widely shared social expec-\n——————\n   1 The Court is correct that this case does not involve a situation, al-\n\nluded to in Randolph, where “the police have removed the potentially\nobjecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible\nobjection.” Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 121 (2006). Here, as in\nRandolph, no one disputes that the police had probable cause to place\nthe objecting tenant under arrest. But had the objector’s arrest been\nillegal, Randolph suggested, the remaining occupant’s consent to the\nsearch would not suffice. The suggestion in Randolph, as the Court\nrecognizes, see ante, at 9–10, is at odds with today’s decision. For “[i]f\nthe police cannot prevent a co-tenant from objecting to a search through\narrest, surely they cannot arrest a co-tenant and then seek to ignore an\nobjection he has already made.” United States v. Murphy, 516 F. 3d\n1117, 1124–1125 (CA9 2008).\n4                FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ntations” and “customary social usage” undergirding Ran-\ndolph’s holding apply only when the objector remains\nphysically present. Ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Randolph’s discussion of social expectations,\nhowever, does not hinge on the objector’s physical pres-\nence vel non at the time of the search. “[W]hen people\nliving together disagree over the use of their common\nquarters,” Randolph observes, “a resolution must come\nthrough voluntary accommodation, not by appeals to\nauthority.” 547 U. S., at 113–114. See also id., at 114\n(“[T]here is no common understanding that one co-tenant\ngenerally has a right or authority to prevail over the ex-\npress wishes of another, whether the issue is the color of\nthe curtains or invitations to outsiders.”); id., at 115\n(“[T]he cooperative occupant’s invitation adds nothing to\nthe government’s side to counter the force of an objecting\nindividual’s claim to security against the government’s\nintrusion into his dwelling place.”).         Randolph thus\ntrained on whether a joint occupant had conveyed an\nobjection to a visitor’s entry, and did not suggest that the\nobjection could be ignored if the police reappeared post the\nobjector’s arrest.\n   A visitor might be less reluctant to enter over a joint\noccupant’s objection, the Court speculates, if that visitor\nknows the objector will not be there. See ante, at 11–12.\n“Only in a Hobbesian world,” however, “would one person’s\nsocial obligations to another be limited to what the other[,\nbecause of his presence,] is . . . able to enforce.” United\nStates v. Henderson, 536 F. 3d 776, 787 (CA7 2008) (Rov-\nner, J., dissenting). Such conjectures about social behav-\nior, at any rate, shed little light on the constitutionality of\nthis warrantless home search, given the marked distinc-\ntions between private interactions and police investiga-\ntions. Police, after all, have power no private person\nenjoys. They can, as this case illustrates, put a tenant in\nhandcuffs and remove him from the premises.\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                     5\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  Moreover, as the Court comprehended just last Term,\n“the background social norms that invite a visitor to the\nfront door do not invite him there to conduct a search.”\nFlorida v. Jardines, 569 U. S. 1, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 7).\nSimilarly here, even if shared tenancy were understood\nto entail the prospect of visits by unwanted social\ncallers while the objecting resident was gone, that un-\nwelcome visitor’s license would hardly include free rein to\nrummage through the dwelling in search of evidence and\ncontraband.2\n  Next, the Court cautions, applying Randolph to these\nfacts would pose “a plethora of practical problems.” Ante,\nat 12. For instance, the Court asks, must a cotenant’s\nobjection, once registered, be respected indefinitely? Yet it\nblinks reality to suppose that Fernandez, by withholding\nconsent, could stop police in their tracks eternally. Cf.\nante, at 12–13 (imagining an objector behind bars serving\nhis sentence, still refusing permission to search his\nresidence). To mount the prosecution eventuating in a\nconviction, of course, the State would first need to obtain\nincriminating evidence, and could get it easily simply by\napplying for a warrant. Warrant in police hands, the\nCourt’s practical problems disappear.\n——————\n  2 Remarkably, the Court thinks my disagreement with its account of\n\nthe applicable social norms distances me from Randolph’s understand-\ning of social expectations. See ante, at 11–12, n. 5. Quite the opposite.\nRandolph considered whether “customary social understanding accords\nthe consenting tenant authority powerful enough to prevail over the co-\ntenant’s objection”; social practice in such circumstances, the Court\nheld, provided no cause to depart from the “ ‘centuries-old principle of\nrespect for privacy of the home.’ ” 547 U. S., at 115, 121 (quoting Wilson\nv. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 610 (1999)). See also 547 U. S., at 115 (“Dis-\nputed permission is . . . no match for this central value of the Fourth\nAmendment . . . .”). I would so hold here. Today’s decision, by contrast,\nprovides police with ready means to nullify a cotenant’s objection, and\ntherefore “fails to come to grips with the reasoning of [Randolph].”\nAnte, at 12, n. 5.\n6                FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  Indeed, as the Court acknowledges, see ante, at 13–14,\nreading Randolph to require continuous physical presence\nposes administrative difficulties of its own. Does an occu-\npant’s refusal to consent lose force as soon as she absents\nherself from the doorstep, even if only for a moment? Are\nthe police free to enter the instant after the objector leaves\nthe door to retire for a nap, answer the phone, use the\nbathroom, or speak to another officer outside? See Brief\nfor Petitioner 28. Hypothesized practical considerations,\nin short, provide no cause for today’s drastic reduction of\nRandolph’s holding and attendant disregard for the war-\nrant requirement.\n                              II\n    In its zeal to diminish Randolph, today’s decision over-\nlooks the warrant requirement’s venerable role as the\n“bulwark of Fourth Amendment protection.” Franks v.\nDelaware, 438 U. S. 154, 164 (1978). Reducing Randolph\nto a “narrow exception,” the Court declares the main rule\nto be that “consent by one resident of jointly occupied\npremises is generally sufficient to justify a warrantless\nsearch.” Ante, at 7. That declaration has it backwards, for\nconsent searches themselves are a “ ‘jealously and care-\nfully drawn’ exception” to “the Fourth Amendment rule\nordinarily prohibiting the warrantless entry of a person’s\nhouse as unreasonable per se.” Randolph, 547 U. S., at\n109 (quoting Jones v. United States, 357 U. S. 493, 499\n(1958)). See also Jardines, 569 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)\n(“[W]hen it comes to the Fourth Amendment, the home is\nfirst among equals. At the Amendment’s ‘very core’ stands\n‘the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there\nbe free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.’ ”);\nPayton v. New York, 445 U.

See ante,\nat 5–6. Where multiple persons occupy the premises, it is true, this\nCourt has upheld warrantless home searches based on one tenant’s\nconsent; those cases, however, did not involve, as this case does, an\noccupant who told the police they could not enter. See United States v.\nMatlock, 415 U. S. 164 (1974) (police relied on cotenant’s consent to\nsearch when other tenant had already been detained in a nearby squad\ncar); Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177 (1990) (same, when the other\ntenant was asleep in the bedroom). The Court’s rationale for allowing a\nsearch to proceed in those instances—that co-occupants “assum[e] the\nrisk that one of their number might permit the common area to be\nsearched,” Matlock, 415 U. S., at 171, n. 7—does not apply where, as\nhere, an occupant on the premises explicitly tells the police they cannot\nsearch his home sans warrant. See United States v. Henderson, 536\nF. 3d 776, 788 (CA7 2008) (Rovner, J., dissenting) (in such circum-\nstances, the objector “has not assumed the risk that his co-tenant may\nsubsequently admit the visitor, because all choice has been taken from\nhim in his involuntary removal from the premises”).\n   4 The Court dismisses as “beside the point” the undeniable fact that\n\nthe police easily could have obtained a warrant. Ante, at 6, n. 4. There\nmay be circumstances, the Court observes, in which the police, faced\nwith a cotenant’s objection, will lack probable cause to obtain a war-\nrant. That same argument was considered and rejected by the Court in\nRandolph, which recognized that “alternatives to disputed consent will\nnot always open the door to search for evidence that the police suspect\nis inside.” 547 U. S., at 120. Moreover, it is unlikely that police,\npossessing an objective basis to arrest an objecting tenant, will never-\ntheless lack probable cause to obtain a search warrant. Probable cause\nto arrest, I recognize, calls for a showing discrete from the showing\nneeded to establish probable cause to search a home. But “where, as\nhere, a suspect is arrested at or near his residence, it will often ‘be\npermissible to infer that the instrumentalities and fruits of th[e] crime\nare presently in that person’s residence.’ ” Brief for National Associa-\ntion of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 25 (quoting 2 W.\nLaFave, Search and Seizure §3.1(b) (5th ed. 2011)). And as the Court\nobserved in Randolph, if a warrant may be impeded by a tenant’s\nrefusal to consent, “[a] co-tenant acting on [her] own initiative may be\nable to deliver evidence to the police, and . . . tell the police what [s]he\n8                   FERNANDEZ v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nnot dispute this, but instead disparages the warrant re-\nquirement as inconvenient, burdensome, entailing delay\n“[e]ven with modern technological advances.” Ante, at 14.\nShut from the Court’s sight is the ease and speed with\nwhich search warrants nowadays can be obtained. See\nMissouri v. McNeely, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at\n11) (observing that technology now “allow[s] for the more\nexpeditious processing of warrant applications,” and citing\nstate statutes permitting warrants to be obtained “remotely\nthrough various means, including telephonic or radio\ncommunication, electronic communication . . . , and video\nconferencing”). See also Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 29 (describ-\ning California’s procedures for electronic warrant applica-\ntions). With these developments in view, dilution of the\nwarrant requirement should be vigilantly resisted.\n   Although the police have probable cause and could\nobtain a warrant with dispatch, if they can gain the con-\nsent of someone other than the suspect, why should the\nlaw insist on the formality of a warrant? Because the\nFramers saw the neutral magistrate as an essential part\nof the criminal process shielding all of us, good or bad,\nsaint or sinner, from unchecked police activity. See, e.g.,\nJohnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 13–14 (1948) (“The\npoint of the Fourth Amendment . . . is not that it denies\nlaw enforcement the support of the usual inferences which\nreasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection con-\nsists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a\nneutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged\nby the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise\nof ferreting out crime.”). “The investigation of crime,” of\ncourse, “would always be simplified if warrants were\nunnecessary.” Mincey v.

See\nalso Randolph, 547 U.

See ante, at 15 (“Denying someone in Rojas’\nposition the right to allow the police to enter her home\nwould also show disrespect for her independence.”).5\nRojas’ situation is not distinguishable from Janet Ran-\ndolph’s in this regard.

At the evidentiary hearing\non Fernandez’ motion to suppress, Rojas testified that the police, upon\nreturning to the residence about an hour after Fernandez’ arrest, began\nquestioning her four-year-old son without her permission. App. 81, 93.\nRojas asked to remain present during that questioning, but the police\nofficer told her that their investigation was “going to determine whether\nor not we take your kids from you right now or not.” Id., at 93. See\nalso ibid. (“I felt like [the police] were going to take my kids away from\nme.”). Rojas thus maintained that she felt “pressured” into giving\nconsent. Id., at 93–94. See also id., at 93 (“I felt like I had no rights.”).\nAfter about 20 or 30 minutes, Rojas acceded to the officer’s request that\nshe sign a consent form. Rojas testified that she “didn’t want to sign\n[the form],” but did so because she “just wanted it to just end.” Id., at\n100.\n   The trial court found Rojas’ testimony at the suppression hearing\n“believable at points and unbelievable at other points,” and concluded\nthat the police conduct did not amount to “duress or coercion.” Id., at\n152. The trial court agreed, however, that Rojas “may have felt pres-\nsured.” Ibid.\n10                  FERNANDEZ v.

S., at\n118 (“[T]his case has no bearing on the capacity of the\npolice to protect domestic victims. . . . No question has\nbeen raised, or reasonably could be, about the authority of\nthe police to enter a dwelling to protect a resident from\ndomestic violence . . . .”). See also Brigham City v. Stuart,\n547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006) (“[L]aw enforcement officers may\nenter a home without a warrant to render emergency\nassistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant\nfrom imminent injury.”). Domestic abuse is indeed “a\nserious problem in the United States,” Randolph, 547\nU. S., at 117 (citing statistics); appropriate policy responses\nto this scourge may include fostering effective counseling,\nproviding public information about, and ready access to,\nprotective orders, and enforcing such orders diligently.6\nAs the Court understood in Randolph, however, the spec-\nter of domestic abuse hardly necessitates the diminution\nof the Fourth Amendment rights at stake here.\n                        *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, I would honor the Fourth\nAmendment’s warrant requirement and hold that Fernan-\ndez’ objection to the search did not become null upon his\narrest and removal from the scene. “There is every reason\nto conclude that securing a warrant was entirely feasible\nin this case, and no reason to contract the Fourth Amend-\nment’s dominion.” Kentucky v.
