Argued November 12, 2013—Decided March 4, 2014\nTo safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the\n  financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Con-\n  gress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. One of the Act’s provi-\n  sions protects whistleblowers; at the time relevant here, that provi-\n  sion instructed: “No [public] company . . ., or any . . . contractor [or]\n  subcontractor . . . of such company, may discharge, demote, suspend,\n  threaten, harass, or . . . discriminate against an employee in the\n  terms and conditions of employment because of [whistleblowing activ-\n  ity].” 18 U. S. C. §1514A(a).\n     Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees of respond-\n  ents (collectively FMR), private companies that contract to advise or\n  manage mutual funds. As is common in the industry, the mutual\n  funds served by FMR are public companies with no employees. Both\n  plaintiffs allege that they blew the whistle on putative fraud relating\n  to the mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered retaliation by\n  FMR. Each commenced suit in federal court. Moving to dismiss the\n  suits, FMR argued that the plaintiffs could state no claim under\n  §1514A, for that provision protects only employees of public compa-\n  nies, and not employees of private companies that contract with pub-\n  lic companies. On interlocutory appeal from the District Court’s de-\n  nial of FMR’s motion to dismiss, the First Circuit reversed,\n  concluding that the term “an employee” in §1514A(a) refers only to\n  employees of public companies.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.\n670 F. 3d 61, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court, concluding that\n  §1514A’s whistleblower protection includes employees of a public\n2                          LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    company’s private contractors and subcontractors. Pp. 9–29.\n       (a) This reading of §1514A is supported by the provision’s text.\n    Pp. 9–16.\n         (1) The Court looks first to the ordinary meaning of the provi-\n    sion’s language. See Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108. As\n    relevant here, §1514A(a) provides that “no . . . contractor . . . may dis-\n    charge . . . an employee.” The ordinary meaning of “an employee” in\n    this proscription is the contractor’s own employee. FMR’s “narrower\n    construction” requires inserting “of a public company” after “an em-\n    ployee,” but where Congress meant “an employee of a public compa-\n    ny,” it said so.\n       The provision as a whole supports this reading. The prohibited re-\n    taliatory measures enumerated in §1514A(a)—discharge, demotion,\n    suspension, threats, harassment, or discrimination in employment\n    terms and conditions—are actions an employer takes against its own\n    employees. Contractors are not ordinarily positioned to take adverse\n    actions against employees of the public company with whom they\n    contract. FMR’s interpretation of §1514A, therefore, would shrink to\n    insignificance the provision’s ban on retaliation by contractors. The\n    protected activity covered by §1514A, and the provision’s enforcement\n    procedures and remedies, also indicate that Congress presumed an\n    employer-employee relationship between the retaliator and the whis-\n    tleblowing employee. Pp. 9–14.\n         (2) FMR’s textual arguments are unpersuasive. It urges that “an\n    employee” must be read to refer exclusively to public company em-\n    ployees to avoid the absurd result of extending protection to the per-\n    sonal employees of company officers and employees, e.g., their house-\n    keepers or gardeners. This concern appears more theoretical than\n    real and, in any event, is outweighed by the compelling arguments\n    opposing FMR’s reading of §1514A. FMR also urges that its reading\n    is supported by the provision’s statutory headings, but those head-\n    ings are “not meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the\n    text.” Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528.\n    Pp. 14–16.\n       (b) Other considerations support the Court’s textual analysis.\n    Pp. 16–27.\n         (1) The Court’s reading fits §1514A’s aim to ward off another En-\n    ron debacle. The legislative record shows Congress’ understanding\n    that outside professionals bear significant responsibility for reporting\n    fraud by the public companies with whom they contract, and that\n    fear of retaliation was the primary deterrent to such reporting by the\n    employees of Enron’s contractors. Sarbanes-Oxley contains numer-\n    ous provisions designed to control the conduct of accountants, audi-\n    tors, and lawyers who work with public companies, but only §1514A\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  affords such employees protection from retaliation by their employers\n  for complying with the Act’s reporting requirements. Pp. 16–20.\n        (2) This Court’s reading of §1514A avoids insulating the entire\n  mutual fund industry from §1514A. Virtually all mutual funds are\n  structured so that they have no employees of their own; they are\n  managed, instead, by independent investment advisors. Accordingly,\n  the “narrower construction” endorsed by FMR would leave §1514A\n  with no application to mutual funds. The Court’s reading of §1514A,\n  in contrast, protects the employees of investment advisors, who are\n  often the only firsthand witnesses to shareholder fraud involving mu-\n  tual funds. Pp. 20–22.\n        (3) There is scant evidence that today’s decision will open any\n  floodgates for whistleblowing suits outside §1514A’s purposes. The\n  Department of Labor’s regulations have interpreted §1514A as pro-\n  tecting contractor employees for almost a decade, yet FMR is unable\n  to identify a single case in which the employee of a private contractor\n  has asserted a §1514A claim based on allegations unrelated to share-\n  holder fraud. Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General suggest various\n  limiting principles to dispel any overbreadth problems. This Court\n  need not determine §1514A’s bounds here, however, because, if plain-\n  tiffs’ allegations prove true, plaintiffs are precisely the “firsthand\n  witnesses to [the shareholder] fraud” Congress anticipated §1514A\n  would protect. S. Rep. No. 107–146, p. 10. Pp. 22–24.\n        (4) The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Pro-\n  tection Act does not affect this Court’s task of determining whether\n  Congress in 2002 afforded protection to whistleblowing contractor\n  employees. Pp. 24–27.\n     (c) AIR 21’s whistleblower protection provision has been read to\n  cover, in addition to employees of air carriers, employees of contrac-\n  tors and subcontractors of the carriers. Given the parallel statutory\n  texts and whistleblower protective aims, the Court reads the words\n  “an employee” in AIR 21 and in §1514A to have similar import.\n  Pp. 27–29.\n     JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS, relying only on 18\n  U. S. C. §1514A’s text and broader context, agreed that §1514A pro-\n  tects employees of private contractors from retaliation when they re-\n  port covered forms of fraud.

ZANG,\n        PETITIONERS v. FMR LLC ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n                                [March 4, 2014]\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  To safeguard investors in public companies and restore\ntrust in the financial markets following the collapse of\nEnron Corporation, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, 116 Stat. 745. See S. Rep. No. 107–146,\npp. 2–11 (2002). A provision of the Act, 18 U. S. C.\n§1514A, protects whistleblowers. Section 1514A, at the\ntime here relevant, instructed:\n    “No [public] company . . . , or any officer, employee,\n    contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company,\n    may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass,\n    or in any other manner discriminate against an em-\n    ployee in the terms and conditions of employment be-\n    cause of [whistleblowing or other protected activity].”\n    §1514A(a) (2006 ed.).\nThis case concerns the definition of the protected class:\nDoes §1514A shield only those employed by the public\ncompany itself, or does it shield as well employees of pri-\nvately held contractors and subcontractors—for example,\ninvestment advisers, law firms, accounting enterprises—\nwho perform work for the public company?\n2                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We hold, based on the text of §1514A, the mischief to\nwhich Congress was responding, and earlier legislation\nCongress drew upon, that the provision shelters employees\nof private contractors and subcontractors, just as it shel-\nters employees of the public company served by the con-\ntractors and subcontractors. We first summarize our\nprincipal reasons, then describe this controversy and\nexplain our decision more comprehensively.\n   Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees\nof private companies that contract to advise or manage\nmutual funds. The mutual funds themselves are public\ncompanies that have no employees. Hence, if the whistle\nis to be blown on fraud detrimental to mutual fund inves-\ntors, the whistleblowing employee must be on another\ncompany’s payroll, most likely, the payroll of the mutual\nfund’s investment adviser or manager.\n   Taking the allegations of the complaint as true, both\nplaintiffs blew the whistle on putative fraud relating to\nthe mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered adverse\naction by their employers. Plaintiffs read §1514A to con-\nvey that “[n]o . . . contractor . . . may . . . discriminate\nagainst [its own] employee [for whistleblowing].” We find\nthat reading consistent with the text of the statute and\nwith common sense. Contractors are in control of their\nown employees, but are not ordinarily positioned to control\nsomeone else’s workers. Moreover, we resist attributing to\nCongress a purpose to stop a contractor from retaliating\nagainst whistleblowers employed by the public company\nthe contractor serves, while leaving the contractor free to\nretaliate against its own employees when they reveal\ncorporate fraud.\n   In the Enron scandal that prompted the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct, contractors and subcontractors, including the ac-\ncounting firm Arthur Andersen, participated in Enron’s\nfraud and its coverup. When employees of those contrac-\ntors attempted to bring misconduct to light, they encoun-\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntered retaliation by their employers. The Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct contains numerous provisions aimed at controlling the\nconduct of accountants, auditors, and lawyers who work\nwith public companies. See, e.g., 116 Stat. 750–765, 773–\n774, 784, §§101–107, 203–206, 307. Given Congress’\nconcern about contractor conduct of the kind that contrib-\nuted to Enron’s collapse, we regard with suspicion con-\nstruction of §1514A to protect whistleblowers only when\nthey are employed by a public company, and not when\nthey work for the public company’s contractor.\n   Congress borrowed §1514A’s prohibition against retalia-\ntion from the wording of the 2000 Wendell H. Ford Avia-\ntion Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR\n21), 49 U. S. C. §42121. That Act provides: “No air carrier\nor contractor or subcontractor of an air carrier may dis-\ncharge an employee or otherwise discriminate against an\nemployee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions,\nor privileges of employment” when the employee provides\ninformation regarding violations “relating to air carrier\nsafety” to his or her employer or federal authorities.\n§42121(a)(1). AIR 21 has been read to cover, in addition to\nemployees of air carriers, employees of contractors and\nsubcontractors of the carriers. Given the parallel statu-\ntory texts and whistleblower protective aims, we read\nthe words “an employee” in AIR 21 and in §1514A to have\nsimilar import.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley or Act)\naims to “prevent and punish corporate and criminal fraud,\nprotect the victims of such fraud, preserve evidence of\nsuch fraud, and hold wrongdoers accountable for their\nactions.” S. Rep. No. 107–146, p. 2 (2002) (hereinafter\n4                       LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nS. Rep.).1 Of particular concern to Congress was abundant\nevidence that Enron had succeeded in perpetuating its\nmassive shareholder fraud in large part due to a “corpo-\nrate code of silence”; that code, Congress found, “discour-\nage[d] employees from reporting fraudulent behavior not\nonly to the proper authorities, such as the FBI and the\nSEC, but even internally.” Id., at 4–5 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). When employees of Enron and its ac-\ncounting firm, Arthur Andersen, attempted to report\ncorporate misconduct, Congress learned, they faced retali-\nation, including discharge. As outside counsel advised\ncompany officials at the time, Enron’s efforts to “quiet”\nwhistleblowers generally were not proscribed under then-\nexisting law. Id., at 5, 10. Congress identified the lack of\nwhistleblower protection as “a significant deficiency” in\nthe law, for in complex securities fraud investigations,\nemployees “are [often] the only firsthand witnesses to the\nfraud.” Id., at 10.\n  Section 806 of Sarbanes-Oxley addresses this concern.\nTitled “Protection for Employees of Publicly Traded Com-\npanies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud,” §806 added a new\nprovision to Title 18 of the United States Code, 18 U. S. C.\n§1514A, which reads in relevant part:\n     “Civil action to protect against retaliation in\n     fraud cases\n     “(a) WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES\n——————\n  1 Title VIII of the Act, which contains the whistleblower protection\n\nprovision at issue in this case, was authored by Senators Leahy and\nGrassley and originally constituted a discrete bill, S. 2010. We thus\nlook to the Senate Report for S. 2010, S. Rep. No. 107–146, as the\nSenate Report relevant here. See 148 Cong. Rec. S7418 (daily ed. July\n26, 2002) (statement of Sen. Leahy) (“unanimous consent” to “includ[e]\nin the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD as part of the official legislative history”\nof Sarbanes-Oxley that Title VIII’s “terms track almost exactly the\nprovisions of S. 2010, introduced by Senator Leahy and reported\nunanimously from the Committee on the Judiciary”).\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Plaintiffs do not fall in either category and, in any\nevent, their claims are governed by the prior version of §1514A. Unless\notherwise noted, all citations to §1514A are to the original text in the\n2006 edition of the United States Code.\n6                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovisions, including §1514A, to DOL’s Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA). Ibid. OSHA’s\norder may be appealed to an administrative law judge,\nand then to DOL’s Administrative Review Board (ARB).\n29 CFR §§1980.104 to 1980.110 (2011).\n   In common with other whistleblower protection provi-\nsions enforced by DOL, see 77 Fed. Reg. 3912 (2012), the\nARB’s determination on a §1514A claim constitutes the\nagency’s final decision and is reviewable in federal court\nunder the standards stated in the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act, 5 U. S. C. §706. If, however, the ARB does not\nissue a final decision within 180 days of the filing of the\ncomplaint, and the delay is not due to bad faith on the\nclaimant’s part, the claimant may proceed to federal dis-\ntrict court for de novo review. 18 U. S. C. §1514A(b). An\nemployee prevailing in a proceeding under §1514A is\nentitled to “all relief necessary to make the employee\nwhole,” including “reinstatement with the same seniority\nstatus that the employee would have had, but for the\ndiscrimination,” backpay with interest, and compensation\nfor litigation costs. §1514A(c).\n   Congress modeled §1514A on the anti-retaliation provi-\nsion of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and\nReform Act for the 21st Century (AIR 21), 49 U. S. C.\n§42121, a measure enacted two years earlier. See S. Rep.,\nat 30 (corporate whistleblower protections “track [AIR\n21’s] protections as closely as possible”).

Instead, they contract with investment\nadvisers like respondents to handle their day-to-day oper-\nations, which include making investment decisions, pre-\nparing reports for shareholders, and filing reports with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Lawson was\nemployed by Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC, a subsidi-\nary of FMR Corp., which was succeeded by FMR LLC.\nZang was employed by a different FMR LLC subsidiary,\nFidelity Management & Research Co., and later by one of\nthat company’s subsidiaries, FMR Co., Inc. For conven-\nience, we refer to respondents collectively as FMR.\n   Lawson worked for FMR for 14 years, eventually serv-\ning as a Senior Director of Finance. She alleges that, after\nshe raised concerns about certain cost accounting method-\nologies, believing that they overstated expenses associated\nwith operating the mutual funds, she suffered a series\nof adverse actions, ultimately amounting to constructive\ndischarge. Zang was employed by FMR for eight years,\nmost recently as a portfolio manager for several of the\nfunds. He alleges that he was fired in retaliation for\nraising concerns about inaccuracies in a draft SEC reg-\nistration statement concerning certain Fidelity funds.\nLawson and Zang separately filed administrative com-\nplaints alleging retaliation proscribed by §1514A. After\nexpiration of the 180-day period specified in §1514A(b)(1),\nLawson and Zang each filed suit in the U. S. District\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts.\n   FMR moved to dismiss the suits, arguing, as relevant,\nthat neither plaintiff has a claim for relief under §1514A.\nFMR is privately held, and maintained that §1514A pro-\ntects only employees of public companies—i.e., companies\nthat either have “a class of securities registered under\nsection 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,” or that\nare “required to file reports under section 15(d)” of that\n8                       LAWSON v.

The majority agreed\nwith FMR, however, that “an employee” refers only to\nemployees of public companies and does not cover a con-\ntractor’s own employees. Id., at 68–80. Judge Thompson\ndissented. In her view, the majority had “impose[d] an\nunwarranted restriction on the intentionally broad lan-\nguage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act” and “bar[red] a signifi-\ncant class of potential securities-fraud whistleblowers\nfrom any legal protection.” Id., at 83.\n   Several months later, the ARB issued a decision in an\nunrelated case, Spinner v. David Landau & Assoc., LLC,\nNo. 10–111 etc., ALJ No. 2010–SOX–029 (May 31, 2012),5\ndisagreeing with the Court of Appeals’ interpretation of\n§1514A. In a comprehensive opinion, the ARB explained\nits position that §1514A affords whistleblower protection\nto employees of privately held contractors that render\nservices to public companies. Ibid.6\n——————\n    3 Here,as just noted, the public company has no employees. See su-\npra, at 2.\n   4 As §1514A treats contractors and subcontractors identically, we\n\ngenerally refer simply to “contractors” without distinguishing between\nthe two.\n   5 The whistleblower in Spinner was an employee of an accounting\n\nfirm that provided auditing, consulting, and Sarbanes-Oxley compli-\nance services to a public company.\n   6 The dissent maintains that the ARB’s interpretation of §1514A is\n\nnot entitled to deference because, “if any agency has the authority to\nresolve ambiguities in §1514A with the force of law, it is the SEC, not\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

S. ___ (2013), to resolve\nthe division of opinion on whether §1514A extends whis-\ntleblower protection to employees of privately held con-\ntractors who perform work for public companies.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n  In determining the meaning of a statutory provision,\n“we look first to its language, giving the words used their\nordinary meaning.” Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). As Judge Thompson observed in her dissent\nfrom the Court of Appeals’ judgment, “boiling [§1514A(a)]\ndown to its relevant syntactic elements, it provides that\n‘no . . . contractor . . . may discharge . . . an employee.’ ”\n670 F. 3d, at 84 (quoting §1514A(a)). The ordinary mean-\ning of “an employee” in this proscription is the contractor’s\nown employee.\n  FMR’s interpretation of the text requires insertion of\n“of a public company” after “an employee.” But where Con-\ngress meant “an employee of a public company,” it said so:\nWith respect to the actors governed by §1514A, the provi-\n——————\nthe Department of Labor.” Post, at 18. Because we agree with the\nARB’s conclusion that §1514A affords protection to a contractor’s\nemployees, we need not decide what weight that conclusion should\ncarry. We note, however, that the SEC apparently does not share the\ndissent’s view that it, rather than DOL, has interpretive authority over\n§1514A. To the contrary, the SEC is a signatory to the Government’s\nbrief in this case, which takes the position that Congress has charged\nthe Secretary of Labor with interpreting §1514A. Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 9–11, 31–34. That view is hardly surprising\ngiven the lead role played by DOL in administering whistleblower\nstatutes. See supra, at 5. The dissent observes that the SEC “has\nnot issued a regulation applying §1514A whistleblower protection to\nemployees of public company contractors,” post, at 18, but omits to\ninform that the SEC has not promulgated any regulations interpreting\n§1514A, consistent with its view that Congress delegated that respon-\nsibility to DOL.\n10                    LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nsion’s interdictions run to the officers, employees, contrac-\ntors, subcontractors, and agents “of such company,” i.e., a\npublic company. §1514A(a). Another anti-retaliation pro-\nvision in Sarbanes-Oxley provides: “[A] broker or dealer\nand persons employed by a broker or dealer who are\ninvolved with investment banking activities may not,\ndirectly or indirectly, retaliate against or threaten to\nretaliate against any securities analyst employed by that\nbroker or dealer or its affiliates . . . .” 15 U. S. C. §78o–\n6(a)(1)(C) (emphasis added). In contrast, nothing in\n§1514A’s language confines the class of employees protected\nto those of a designated employer. Absent any textual\nqualification, we presume the operative language means\nwhat it appears to mean: A contractor may not retaliate\nagainst its own employee for engaging in protected whistle-\nblowing activity.7\n   Section 1514A’s application to contractor employees\nis confirmed when we enlarge our view from the term\n“an employee” to the provision as a whole. The prohib-\nited retaliatory measures enumerated in §1514A(a)—\ndischarge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, or dis-\ncrimination in the terms and conditions of employment—\nare commonly actions an employer takes against its\nown employees. Contractors are not ordinarily posi-\ntioned to take adverse actions against employees of the\npublic company with whom they contract. FMR’s inter-\npretation of §1514A, therefore, would shrink to insignifi-\ncance the provision’s ban on retaliation by contractors.\nThe dissent embraces FMR’s “narrower” construction. See\npost, at 2, 3, 4, 7.\n   FMR urges that Congress included contractors in\n§1514A’s list of governed actors simply to prevent public\n——————\n  7 We need not decide in this case whether §1514A also prohibits a\n\ncontractor from retaliating against an employee of one of the other\nactors governed by the provision.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

FMR describes\nsuch a contractor as an “ax-wielding specialist,” illustrated\nby George Clooney’s character in the movie Up in the Air.8\nBrief for Respondents 24–25 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). As portrayed by Clooney, an ax-wielding special-\nist is a contractor engaged only as the bearer of the bad\nnews that the employee has been fired; he plays no role in\ndeciding who to terminate. If the company employing the\nax-wielder chose the recipients of the bad tidings for retal-\niatory reasons, the §1514A claim would properly be di-\nrected at the company. Hiring the ax-wielder would not\ninsulate the company from liability. Moreover, we see no\nindication that retaliatory ax-wielding specialists are the\nreal-world problem that prompted Congress to add con-\ntractors to §1514A.9\n   Moving further through §1514A to the protected activity\ndescribed in subsection (a)(1), we find further reason to\n——————\n  8 This hypothetical originates in a Seventh Circuit opinion, Fleszar v.\nUnited States Dept. of Labor, 598 F. 3d 912, 915 (2010), and is men-\ntioned in a footnote in the First Circuit’s opinion in this case, 670 F. 3d\n61, 69, n. 11 (2012).\n   9 When asked during oral argument for an example of actual circum-\n\nstances in which a contractor would have employment decisionmak-\ning authority over public company employees, FMR’s counsel cited\nKalkunte v. DVI Financial Servs., Inc., No. 05–139 etc., ALJ No. 2004–\nSOX–056 (Feb. 27, 2009). Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. That case involved a\nbankrupt public company that hired a private company to handle its\ndissolution. The ARB found the private company liable under §1514A\nbecause it acted as a “contractor, subcontractor, or agent” of the public\ncompany in discharging the claimant. ALJ No. 2004–SOX–056, at 10\n(emphasis added). Neither FMR nor its amici have pointed us to any\nactual situation in which a public company employee would be vulner-\nable to retaliatory conduct by a contractor not already covered as an\n“agent” under §1514A. Notably, even in Tides v. The Boeing Co., 644\nF. 3d 809 (CA9 2011), the case cited by the dissent for the proposition\nthat contractors may possess “managerial authority” over public\ncompany employees, post, at 10, the alleged retaliation was by the\npublic company itself.\n12                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbelieve that Congress presumed an employer-employee\nrelationship between the retaliator and the whistleblower.\nEmployees gain protection for furnishing information to a\nfederal agency, Congress, or “a person with supervisory\nauthority over the employee (or such other person working\nfor the employer who has the authority to investigate,\ndiscover, or terminate misconduct).” §1514A(a)(1) (em-\nphasis added). And under §1514A(a)(2), employees are\nprotected from retaliation for assisting “in a proceeding\nfiled or about to be filed (with any knowledge of the em-\nployer) relating to an alleged violation” of any of the enu-\nmerated fraud provisions, securities regulations, or other\nfederal law relating to shareholder fraud. §1514A(a)(2)\n(emphasis added). The reference to employer knowledge is\nan additional indicator of Congress’ expectation that the\nretaliator typically will be the employee’s employer, not\nanother entity less likely to know of whistleblower com-\nplaints filed or about to be filed.\n   Section 1514A’s enforcement procedures and remedies\nsimilarly contemplate that the whistleblower is an em-\nployee of the retaliator. As earlier noted, see supra, at 6,\n§1514A(b)(2)(A) provides that a claim under §1514A “shall\nbe governed under the rules and procedures set forth in\nsection 42121(b) of title 49,” i.e., AIR 21’s anti-retaliation\nprovision. Throughout §42121(b), the respondent is re-\nferred to as “the employer.” See 49 U. S. C. §42121(b)(2)\n(B)(ii) (The Secretary shall not conduct an investigation\ninto a retaliation claim “if the employer demonstrates,\nby clear and convincing evidence, that the employer would\nhave taken the same unfavorable personnel action in\nthe absence of that behavior.”); §42121(b)(2)(B)(iv)\n(“Relief may not be ordered . . . if the employer demon-\nstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the employer\nwould have taken the same unfavorable personnel action\nin the absence of that behavior.”).\n   Regarding remedies, §1514A(c)(2) states that a success-\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nful claimant shall be entitled to “reinstatement with the\nsame seniority status that the employee would have had,\nbut for the discrimination,” as well as “the amount of back\npay, with interest.” As the Solicitor General, for the United\nStates as amicus curiae, observed, “It is difficult, if not\nimpossible, to see how a contractor or subcontractor could\nprovide those remedies to an employee of a public company.”\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15. The most\nsensible reading of §1514A’s numerous references to an\nemployer-employee relationship between the respondent\nand the claimant is that the provision’s protections run\nbetween contractors and their own employees.\n   Remarkably, the dissent attributes to Congress a\nstrange design. Under the dissent’s “narrower” construc-\ntion, post, at 2, 3, 4, 7, a public company’s contractor may\nnot retaliate against a public company’s employees, aca-\ndemic here because the public company has no employees.\nAccording to the dissent, this coverage is necessary to\nprevent “a gaping hole” that would allow public companies\nto “evade §1514A simply by hiring a contractor to engage\nin the very retaliatory acts that an officer or employee\ncould not.” Post, at 10. This cannot be right—even if\nCongress had omitted any reference to contractors, sub-\ncontractors, or agents in §1514A, the remaining language\nsurely would prohibit a public company from directing\nsomeone else to engage in retaliatory conduct against the\npublic company’s employees; hiring an ax-wielder to an-\nnounce an employee’s demotion does not change the fact\nthat the public company is the entity commanding the\ndemotion. Under the dissent’s reading of §1514A, the\ninclusion of contractors as covered employers does no more\nthan make the contractor secondarily liable for complying\nwith such marching orders—hardly a hole at all.10\n——————\n   10 The dissent suggests that we “fai[l] to recognize” that its construc-\n\ntion also makes contractors primarily liable for retaliating of their own\n14                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   There would be a huge hole, on the other hand, were the\ndissent’s view of §1514A’s reach to prevail: Contractors’\nemployees would be disarmed; they would be vulnerable\nto retaliation by their employers for blowing the whistle\non a scheme to defraud the public company’s investors,\neven a scheme engineered entirely by the contractor. Not\nonly would mutual fund advisers and managers escape\n§1514A’s control. Legions of accountants and lawyers\nwould be denied §1514A’s protections. See infra, at 19–22.\nInstead of indulging in fanciful visions of whistleblowing\nbabysitters and the like, post, at 1–2, 6, 12–13, 20, the\ndissent might pause to consider whether a Congress,\nprompted by the Enron debacle, would exclude from whis-\ntleblower protection countless professionals equipped to\nbring fraud on investors to a halt.\n                             B\n  We turn next to two textual arguments made by FMR.\nFirst, FMR urges that “an employee” must be read to refer\nexclusively to public company employees to avoid the\nabsurd result of extending protection to the personal\nemployees of company officers and employees, e.g., their\nhousekeepers or gardeners. See Brief for Respondents 19–\n20; post, at 1–2, 6, 12–13, 20. Plaintiffs and the Solicitor\nGeneral do not defend §1514A’s application to personal\nemployees. They argue, instead, that the prohibition\nagainst an “officer” or “employee” retaliating against “an\nemployee” may be read as imposing personal liability only\non officers and employees who retaliate against other\npublic company employees. Brief for Petitioners 12; Brief\n\n—————— \n\nvolition against employees of public companies. Post, at 10, n. 6. As \n\nexplained supra, at 11–12, n. 9, however, FMR and its supporters have\n\nidentified not even one real-world instance of a public company employee\n\nasserting a §1514A claim alleging retaliatory conduct by a contractor.\n\nAgain, no “gaping hole,” practically no hole at all.\n\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 16.11 FMR calls this\nreading “bizarre,” for it would ascribe to the words “an\nemployee” in §1514A(a) “one meaning if the respondent is\nan ‘officer’ and a different meaning if the respondent is a\n‘contractor.’ ” Brief for Respondents 20–21.\n   We agree with FMR that plaintiffs and the Solicitor\nGeneral offer an interpretation at odds with the text Con-\ngress enacted. If, as we hold, “an employee” includes\nemployees of contractors, then grammatically, the term\nalso includes employees of public company officers and\nemployees. Nothing suggests Congress’ attention was\ndrawn to the curiosity its drafting produced. The issue,\nhowever, is likely more theoretical than real. Few house-\nkeepers or gardeners, we suspect, are likely to come upon\nand comprehend evidence of their employer’s complicity in\nfraud. In any event, FMR’s point is outweighed by the\ncompelling arguments opposing FMR’s contention that “an\nemployee” refers simply and only to public company em-\nployees. See supra, at 9–14. See also infra, at 23–24\n(limiting principles may serve as check against overbroad\napplications).\n     Second, FMR argues that the statutory headings\nsupport the exclusion of contractor employees from\n§1514A’s protections. Although §1514A’s own heading is\nbroad (“Civil action to protect against retaliation in fraud\ncases”), subsection (a) is captioned “Whistleblower Protec-\ntion for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies.” Simi-\nlarly, the relevant public law section, §806 of Sarbanes-\nOxley, is captioned “Protection for Employees of Publicly\nTraded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.” 116\n——————\n   11 The ARB endorsed this view in Spinner v. David Landau & Assoc.,\n\nLLC, No. 10–111 etc., ALJ No. 2010–SOX–029, p. 8 (May 31, 2012). We\nhave no occasion to determine whether the ARB would be entitled to\ndeference in this regard, for, as explained in text, we find that the\nstatutory text unambiguously affords protection to personal employees\nof public company officers and employees. §1514A(a).\n16                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nStat. 802. The Court of Appeals described the latter two\nheadings as “explicit guides” limiting protection under\n§1514A to employees of public companies. 670 F. 3d, at\n69.\n   This Court has placed less weight on captions. In\nTrainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519\n(1947), we explained that where, as here, “the [statutory]\ntext is complicated and prolific, headings and titles can do\nno more than indicate the provisions in a most general\nmanner.” Id., at 528. The under-inclusiveness of the two\nheadings relied on by the Court of Appeals is apparent.\nThe provision indisputably extends protection to employ-\nees of companies that file reports with the SEC pursuant\nto §15(d) of the 1934 Act, even when such companies are\nnot “publicly traded.” And the activity protected under\n§1514A is not limited to “provid[ing] evidence of fraud”; it\nalso includes reporting violations of SEC rules or regula-\ntions. §1514A(a)(1). As in Trainmen, the headings here\nare “but a short-hand reference to the general subject\nmatter” of the provision, “not meant to take the place of\nthe detailed provisions of the text.” 331 U. S., at 528.\nSection 1514A is attended by numerous indicators that the\nstatute’s prohibitions govern the relationship between a\ncontractor and its own employees; we do not read the\nheadings to “undo or limit” those signals. Id., at 529.12\n                            III\n\n                             A\n\n   Our textual analysis of §1514A fits the provision’s pur-\npose. It is common ground that Congress installed whis-\ntleblower protection in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as one\n——————\n  12 AIR 21’s anti-retaliation provision, on which §1514A is based, in-\n\ncludes a similarly composed heading, “Discrimination against airline\nemployees.” 49 U. S. C. §42121(a). Nevertheless, that provision has\nbeen read to cover employees of companies rendering contract services\nto airlines. See infra, at 27–29.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

And, as the ARB observed in Spinner, “Congress\nplainly recognized that outside professionals—ac-\ncountants, law firms, contractors, agents, and the like—\nwere complicit in, if not integral to, the shareholder fraud\nand subsequent cover-up [Enron] officers . . . perpetrated.”\nALJ No. 2010–SOX–029, pp. 12–13. Indeed, the Senate\nReport demonstrates that Congress was as focused on the\nrole of Enron’s outside contractors in facilitating the fraud\nas it was on the actions of Enron’s own officers. See, e.g.,\nS. Rep., at 3 (fraud “occurred with extensive participation\nand structuring advice from Arthur Andersen . . . which\nwas simultaneously serving as both consultant and inde-\npendent auditor for Enron” (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted)); id., at 4 (“professionals from account-\ning firms, law firms and business consulting firms, who\nwere paid millions to advise Enron on these practices,\nassured others that Enron was a solid investment”); id., at\n4–5 (team of Andersen employees were tasked with de-\nstroying “physical evidence and documents” relating to\nEnron’s fraud); id., at 5 (“Enron and Andersen were taking\nadvantage of a system that allowed them to behave in an\napparently fraudulent manner”); id., at 11 (Enron’s fraud\npartly attributable to “the well-paid professionals who\nhelped create, carry out, and cover up the complicated\ncorporate ruse when they should have been raising con-\ncerns”); id., at 20–21 (“Enron’s accountants and lawyers\nbrought all their skills and knowledge to bear in assisting\nthe fraud to succeed and then in covering it up.”).\n  Also clear from the legislative record is Congress’ under-\nstanding that outside professionals bear significant re-\nsponsibility for reporting fraud by the public companies\nwith whom they contract, and that fear of retaliation was\nthe primary deterrent to such reporting by the employ-\nees of Enron’s contractors. Congressional investigators\ndiscovered ample evidence of contractors demoting or dis-\n18                 LAWSON v.

See, e.g., Oppel,\nMerrill Replaced Research Analyst Who Upset Enron,\nN. Y. Times, July 30, 2002, p. A1 (“In the summer of 1998,\nwhen it was eager to win more investment banking busi-\nness from Enron, Merrill Lynch replaced a research ana-\nlyst who had angered Enron executives by rating the\ncompany’s stock ‘neutral’ with an analyst who soon up-\ngraded the rating, according to Congressional investi-\ngators.”); Yost, Andersen Whistleblower Was Removed,\nAssociated Press (Apr. 3, 2002) (Congressional investiga-\ntion reveals that Andersen removed one of its partners\nfrom its Enron team after Enron officials expressed un-\nhappiness with the partner’s questioning of certain ac-\ncounting practices); Oppel, The Man Who Paid the Price\nfor Sizing up Enron, N.

Emphasizing the importance of outside profes-\nsionals as “gatekeepers who detect and deter fraud,” the\nSenate Report concludes: “Congress must reconsider the\nincentive system that has been set up that encourages\naccountants and lawyers who come across fraud in their\nwork to remain silent.” Id., at 20–21.

In\nparticular, FMR points to sections of the Act requiring\naccountants and lawyers for public companies to investi-\ngate and report misconduct, or risk being banned from\nfurther practice before the SEC. Id., at 41 (citing 15\nU. S. C. §§7215(c)(4), 7245). These requirements, however,\nindicate why Congress would have wanted to extend\n§1514A’s coverage to the many lawyers and accountants\nwho perform outside work for public companies. Although\nlawyers and accountants are subject to extensive regula-\ntions and sanctions throughout Sarbanes-Oxley, no provi-\nsion of the Act other than §1514A affords them protection\nfrom retaliation by their employers for complying with the\nAct’s reporting requirements.14 In short, we cannot coun-\n——————\n  13 FMR urges that the Senate Report’s references to “employees of\n\npublicly traded companies” demonstrate that Congress wanted to limit\nwhistleblower protection to such employees. Brief for Respondents 30–\n31. This argument fails for the same reason that FMR’s reliance on the\nstatutory section headings fails: “employees of publicly traded compa-\nnies” must be understood as shorthand not designed to capture every\nemployee covered by §1514A. See supra, at 15–16. Senator Sarbanes’\nstatement, cited in the concurring opinion, post, at 2, is similarly\nimprecise. The Act indisputably covers private accounting firms and\nlaw firms that provide services to public companies. See, e.g., 15 U. S.\nC. §§7215, 7245. Indeed, Senator Sarbanes acknowledged this point in\nhis very next sentence. See 148 Cong. Rec. 14440 (2002) (remarks of\nSen.

As companies\n“required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securi-\nties Exchange Act of 1934,” 18 U. S. C. §1514A(a), mutual\nfunds unquestionably are governed by §1514A. Because\nmutual funds figure prominently among such report-filing\ncompanies, Congress presumably had them in mind when\nit added to “publicly traded companies” the discrete cate-\ngory of companies “required to file reports under section\n15(d).”\n   Virtually all mutual funds are structured so that they\nhave no employees of their own; they are managed, in-\nstead, by independent investment advisers. See S. Rep.\nNo. 91–184, p. 5 (1969) (accompanying the 1970 amend-\nments to the Investment Company Act of 1940). The\nUnited States investment advising industry manages\n$14.7 trillion on behalf of nearly 94 million investors. See\n2013 Investment Company Fact Book 7 (53d ed.), availa-\nble at http://www.icifactbook.org/pdf/2013_factbook.pdf (as\nvisited Feb. 20, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). These investment advisers, under our reading\n\n—————— \n\nBoard’s and the SEC’s authority to sanction unprofessional conduct by \n\naccountants and lawyers, respectively, “could well provide” a disincen-\ntive to retaliate against other accountants and lawyers. See post, at 15.\n\nThe possibility of such sanctions, however, is cold comfort to the ac-\ncountant or lawyer who loses her job in retaliation for her efforts to \n\ncomply with the Act’s requirements if, as the dissent would have it,\n\n§1514A does not enable her to seek reinstatement or backpay. \n\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

This construction protects the “insiders [who]\nare the only firsthand witnesses to the [shareholder]\nfraud.” S. Rep., at 10. Under FMR’s and the dissent’s\nreading, in contrast, §1514A has no application to mutual\nfunds, for all of the potential whistleblowers are employed\nby the privately held investment management companies,\nnot by the mutual funds themselves. See Brief for Re-\nspondents 45 (describing this glaring gap as “merely a\nconsequence of the corporate structure” of mutual funds).\n  The Court of Appeals found exclusion of the mutual\nfund industry from §1514A tenable because mutual funds\nand their investment advisers are separately regulated\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U. S. C.\n§80a–1 et seq., the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15\nU. S. C. §80b–1 et seq., and elsewhere in Sarbanes-Oxley.\n670 F. 3d, at 72–73. See also post, at 16–17, n. 10. But\nthis separate regulation does not remove the problem, for\nnowhere else in these legislative measures are investment\nmanagement employees afforded whistleblower protection.\nSection 1514A alone shields them from retaliation for\nbringing fraud to light.\n  Indeed, affording whistleblower protection to mutual\nfund investment advisers is crucial to Sarbanes-Oxley’s\nendeavor to “protect investors by improving the accuracy\nand reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to\nthe securities laws.” 116 Stat. 745. As plaintiffs observe,\nthese disclosures are written, not by anyone at the mutual\nfunds themselves, but by employees of the investment\nadvisers. “Under FMR’s [and the dissent’s] proposed in-\nterpretation of section 1514A, FMR could dismiss any\nFMR employee who disclosed to the directors of or lawyers\nfor the Fidelity funds that there were material falsehoods\nin the documents being filed by FMR with the SEC in the\nname of those funds.” Reply Brief 13.

See post, at 1–2, 6,\n12–13, 20–21. FMR’s amici also press this point, observ-\ning that the activity protected under §1514A(a)(1) encom-\npasses reporting not only securities fraud (18 U. S. C.\n§1348), but also mail, wire, and bank fraud (§§1341, 1343,\n1344). Including contractor employees in the protected\nclass, they therefore assert, could “cas[t] a wide net over\nemployees who have no exposure to investor-related activ-\nities and thus could not possibly assist in detecting inves-\ntor fraud.” Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United\nStates of America as Amicus Curiae 3. See also Brief for\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets Association as\nAmicus Curiae 7–16.\n   There is scant evidence, however, that these floodgate-\nopening concerns are more than hypothetical. DOL’s\nregulations have interpreted §1514A as protecting con-\ntractor employees for almost a decade.15 See 69 Fed. Reg.\n52105–52106 (2004). Yet no “narrower construction”\nadvocate has identified even a single case in which the\nemployee of a private contractor has asserted a §1514A\nclaim based on allegations unrelated to shareholder fraud.\nFMR’s parade of horribles rests solely on Lockheed Martin\nCorp. v.

The dissent’s fears that household employ-\nees and others, on learning of today’s decision, will be\nprompted to pursue retaliation claims, post, at 13, and\nthat OSHA will find them meritorious under §1514A,\nseem to us unwarranted. If we are wrong, however, Con-\ngress can easily fix the problem by amending §1514A\nexplicitly to remove personal employees of public company\nofficers and employees from the provision’s reach. But it\nwould thwart Congress’ dominant aim if contractors were\ntaken off the hook for retaliating against their whistle-\nblowing employees, just to avoid the unlikely prospect that\nbabysitters, nannies, gardeners, and the like will flood\nOSHA with §1514A complaints.\n  Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General observe that over-\nbreadth problems may be resolved by various limit-\ning principles.      They point specifically to the word\n“contractor.” Plaintiffs note that in “common parlance,”\n“contractor” does not extend to every fleeting business\nrelationship. Instead, the word “refers to a party whose\nperformance of a contract will take place over a significant\nperiod of time.” Reply Brief 16. See also Fleszar v.

Lawson alleges that she was construc-\ntively discharged for reporting accounting practices that\noverstated expenses associated with managing certain\nFidelity mutual funds. This alleged fraud directly impli-\ncates the funds’ shareholders: “By inflating its expenses,\nand thus understating its profits, [FMR] could potentially\nincrease the fees it would earn from the mutual funds, fees\nultimately paid by the shareholders of those funds.” Brief\nfor Petitioners 3. Zang alleges that he was fired for ex-\npressing concerns about inaccuracies in a draft registra-\ntion statement FMR prepared for the SEC on behalf of\ncertain Fidelity funds. The potential impact on share-\nholders of false or misleading registration statements\nneeds no elaboration.

(emphasis added; foot-\n     note omitted.)\n  The amended provision extends §1514A’s protection to\nemployees of public company subsidiaries and nationally\nrecognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs).\nFMR asserts that Congress’ decision to add NRSROs to\n§1514A shows that the provision did not previously cover\ncontractor employees: “If [§1514A] already covered every\nprivate company contracting with a public company, there\nwould have been no need for Congress to extend [§1514A]\nto certain private companies.” Brief for Respondents 35–\n36.

Id., at 36.\n   We see nothing useful to our inquiry in Congress’ deci-\nsion to amend §1514A to include public company sub-\nsidiaries and NRSROs. More telling, at the time of the\nDodd-Frank amendments, DOL regulations provided that\n§1514A protects contractor employees.         See 29 CFR\n§1980.101 (2009). Congress included in its alterations no\nlanguage gainsaying that protection. As Judge Thomp-\nson’s dissent from the First Circuit’s judgment observes,\n“Congress had a miles-wide opening to nip [DOL’s] regula-\ntion in the bud if it had wished to do so. It did not.” 670\nF. 3d, at 88.\n   Dodd-Frank also establishes a corporate whistleblowing\nreward program, accompanied by a new provision pro-\nhibiting any employer from retaliating against “a whistle-\nblower” for providing information to the SEC, participating\nin an SEC proceeding, or making disclosures required\nor protected under Sarbanes-Oxley and certain other\nsecurities laws. 15 U. S. C. §78u–6(a)(6), (b)(1), (h). FMR\nurges that, as this provision covers employees of all com-\npanies, public or private, “[t]here is no justification” for\nreading §1514A to cover employees of contractors: “Any\n‘gap’ that might, arguendo, have existed for employees of\nprivate entities between 2002 and 2010 has now been\nclosed.” Brief for Respondents 44.17\n   FMR, we note, somewhat overstates Dodd-Frank’s cov-\nerage.

It is, instead, to de-\ntermine whether Congress afforded protection to contractor\nemployees when it enacted §1514A in 2002.

S. C. §42121, enacted two years\nbefore Sarbanes-Oxley. Congress designed §1514A to\n“track . . . as closely as possible” the protections afforded\nby §42121. S. Rep., at 30. To this end, §1514A incorpo-\nrates by cross-reference §42121’s administrative enforce-\nment regime, see 18 U. S. C. §1514A(b)(2), and contains\nparallel statutory text. Compare §1514A(a) (“No [public]\ncompany . . . or any officer, employee, contractor, subcon-\ntractor, or agent of such company, may discharge, demote,\nsuspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner dis-\ncriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions\nof employment” for engaging in protected activity) with 49\nU.

The ARB has con-\nsistently construed AIR 21 to cover contractor employees.\nE.g., Evans v. Miami Valley Hospital, ARB No. 07–118\netc., ALJ No. 2006–AIR–022, pp. 9–11 (June 30, 2009);\nPeck v. Safe Air Int’l, Inc., ARB No. 02–028, ALJ No.\n2001–AIR–3, p. 13 (Jan. 30, 2004).20 And DOL’s regula-\ntions adopting this interpretation of §42121 date back to\nApril 1, 2002, before §1514A was enacted. 67 Fed. Reg.\n15454, 15457–15458 (2002). The Senate Report for AIR 21\nsupports this reading, explaining that the Act “provide[s]\nemployees of airlines, and employees of airline contractors\nand subcontractors, with statutory whistleblower protec-\ntion.” S. Rep. No. 105–278, p. 22 (1998).21\n   The Court of Appeals recognized that Congress modeled\n§1514A on §42121, and that §42121 has been understood\nto protect contractor employees. 670 F. 3d, at 73–74. It\nnonetheless declined to interpret §1514A the same way,\nbecause, in its view, “important differences” separate the\ntwo provisions.

S. C. §42121(e). Second, unlike §1514A, §42121 does\nnot include “officers” or “employees” among governed\nactors. 670 F. 3d, at 74. These distinctions, the Court of\nAppeals reasoned, render §1514A less amenable to an\ninclusive construction of the protected class. Ibid.22\n  We do not find these textual differences overwhelming.\nTrue, Congress strayed from §42121’s pattern in failing to\ndefine “contractor” for purposes of §1514A, and in adding\n“officers” and “employees” to §1514A’s list of governed\nactors. And we agree that §1514A covers a far wider\nrange than §42121 does. But in our view, neither differ-\nence warrants the determination that §1514A omits em-\nployees of contractors while §42121 includes them. The\nprovisions’ parallel text and purposes counsel in favor of\ninterpreting the two provisions consistently. And we have\nalready canvassed the many reasons why §1514A is most\nsensibly read to protect employees of contractors. See\nsupra, at 9–22.\n                       *     *     *\n  For the reasons stated, we hold that 18 U. S.

S. C.\n§1514A protects employees of private contractors from\nretaliation when they report covered forms of fraud. As\nthe Court carefully demonstrates, that conclusion logically\nflows from §1514A’s text and broader context. I therefore\njoin the Court’s opinion in principal part.\n   I do not endorse, however, the Court’s occasional excur-\nsions beyond the interpretative terra firma of text and\ncontext, into the swamps of legislative history. Reliance\non legislative history rests upon several frail premises.\nFirst, and most important: That the statute means what\nCongress intended. It does not. Because we are a govern-\nment of laws, not of men, and are governed by what\nCongress enacted rather than by what it intended, the sole\nobject of the interpretative enterprise is to determine what\na law says. Second: That there was a congressional “in-\ntent” apart from that reflected in the enacted text. On\nmost issues of detail that come before this Court, I am\nconfident that the majority of Senators and Representa-\ntives had no views whatever on how the issues should be\nresolved—indeed, were unaware of the issues entirely.\nThird: That the views expressed in a committee report or a\n2                       LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nfloor statement represent those of all the Members of that\nHouse. Many of them almost certainly did not read the\nreport or hear the statement, much less agree with it—not\nto mention the Members of the other House and the Presi-\ndent who signed the bill.\n   Since congressional “intent” apart from enacted text is\nfiction to begin with, courts understandably allow them-\nselves a good deal of poetic license in defining it. Today’s\nopinion is no exception. It cites parts of the legislative\nrecord that are consistent with its holding that §1514A\ncovers employees of private contractors and subcontrac-\ntors, but it ignores other parts that unequivocally cut in\nthe opposite direction. For example, the following remark\nby the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s lead sponsor in the Senate:\n“[L]et me make very clear that [the Act] applies exclusively\nto public companies—that is, to companies registered\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is not\napplicable to pr[i]v[at]e companies,[*] who make up the\nvast majority of companies across the country.” 148 Cong.\nRec. 14440 (2002) (remarks of Sen.

Section 1514A(b)(2), entitled\n“Procedure,” contains cross-references to the procedural\nrules set forth in §42121(b), but the substantive provisions\nof §1514A(a) are worded quite differently from the sub-\nstantive prohibition of §42121, which is contained in sub-\nsection (a)—thus making interpretation of the latter an\nunreliable guide to §1514A’s meaning. Second, I do not\nagree with the Court’s acceptance of the possible validity\n——————\n  * The Congressional Record reads “provide companies,” but context as\nwell as grammar makes clear that this is a scrivener’s error for “private\ncompanies.”\n                   Cite as: 571 U.

And the Court points out\nthat Congress entitled the whistleblower provision, “Pro-\ntection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies Who\nProvide Evidence of Fraud.” §806, 116 Stat. 802. Despite\nthese clear markers of intent, the Court does not construe\n§1514A to apply only to public company employees who\nblow the whistle on fraud relating to their public company\nemployers. The Court instead holds that the law encom-\npasses any household employee of the millions of people\nwho work for a public company and any employee of the\nhundreds of thousands of private businesses that contract\n\n——————\n  1 The majority uses the term “public company” as shorthand for 18\n\nU. S. C. §1514A’s reference to companies that either have “ ‘a class of\nsecurities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934,’ ” or that are “ ‘required to file reports under section 15(d).’ ” Ante,\nat 7–8. I do the same.\n2                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                     SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n to perform work for a public company.\n   The Court’s interpretation gives §1514A a stunning\nreach. As interpreted today, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act au-\nthorizes a babysitter to bring a federal case against his\nemployer—a parent who happens to work at the local\nWalmart (a public company)—if the parent stops employ-\ning the babysitter after he expresses concern that the\nparent’s teenage son may have participated in an Internet\npurchase fraud. And it opens the door to a cause of action\nagainst a small business that contracts to clean the local\nStarbucks (a public company) if an employee is demoted\nafter reporting that another nonpublic company client has\nmailed the cleaning company a fraudulent invoice.\n   Congress was of course free to create this kind of sweep-\ning regime that subjects a multitude of individuals and\nprivate businesses to litigation over fraud reports that\nhave no connection to, or impact on, the interests of pub-\nlic company shareholders. But because nothing in the text,\ncontext, or purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act suggests\nthat Congress actually wanted to do so, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                             I\n   Although the majority correctly starts its analysis with\nthe statutory text, it fails to recognize that §1514A is\ndeeply ambiguous. Three indicators of Congress’ intent\nclearly resolve this ambiguity in favor of a narrower inter-\npretation of §1514A: the statute’s headings, the statutory\ncontext, and the absurd results that follow from the major-\nity’s interpretation.\n                                  A\n    The majority begins its textual analysis by declaring\nthat the “ ‘relevant syntactic elements’ ” of §1514A are that\n“ ‘ “no . . . contractor . . . may discharge . . . an employee.” ’ ”\nAnte, at 9. After “ ‘boiling . . . down’ ” the text to this for-\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

But §1514A(a) actu-\nally provides that “[n]o [public] company . . . or any officer,\nemployee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such\ncompany . . . may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten,\nharass, or in any other manner discriminate against an\nemployee.” The provision thus does not speak only (or\neven primarily) to “contractors.” It speaks to public com-\npanies, and then includes a list of five types of representa-\ntives that companies hire to carry out their business:\n“officer[s], employee[s], contractor[s], subcontractor[s],\n[and] agent[s].”\n   Read in full, then, the statute is ambiguous. The major-\nity is correct that it may be read broadly, to create a cause\nof action both for employees of public companies and for\nemployees of the enumerated public company representa-\ntives. But the statute can also be read more narrowly, to\nprohibit the public company and the listed representa-\ntives—all of whom act on the company’s behalf—from\nretaliating against just the public company’s employees.\n   The narrower reading of the text makes particular sense\nwhen one considers the other terms in the list of com-\npany representatives. The majority acknowledges that, as a\nmatter of “gramma[r],” the scope of protected employees\nmust be consistent with respect to all five types of com-\npany representatives listed in §1514A(a). Ante, at 15. Yet\nthe Government and petitioners readily concede that\n§1514A is meant to bar two of the enumerated repre-\nsentatives—“officer[s]” and “employee[s]”—from retaliating\nagainst other employees of the public company, as opposed\nto their own babysitters and housekeepers. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 16 (§1514A “impose[s]\npersonal liability on corporate officers and employees who\n4                       LAWSON v.

David Landau & Assoc., LLC, No. 10–\n111 etc., ALJ No. 2010–SOX–029, p. 8 (May 31, 2012).\nAnd if §1514A prohibits an “officer” or “employee” of a\npublic company from retaliating against only the public\ncompany’s own employees, then as the majority points out,\nthe same should be true “grammatically” of contractors,\nsubcontractors, and agents as well, ante, at 15.2\n  The majority responds by suggesting that the narrower\ninterpretation could have been clearer if Congress had\nadded the phrase “ ‘of a public company’ after ‘an em-\nployee.’ ” Ante, at 9–10. Fair enough. But Congress could\nmore clearly have dictated the majority’s construction of\nthe statute, too: It could have specified that public compa-\nnies and their officers, employees, contractors, subcontrac-\ntors, and agents may not retaliate against “their own\nemployees.” In any case, that Congress could have spoken\nwith greater specificity in both directions only underscores\nthat the words Congress actually chose are ambiguous. To\nresolve this ambiguity, we must rely on other markers of\nintent.\n                             B\n  We have long held that where the text is ambiguous, a\nstatute’s titles can offer “a useful aid in resolving [the]\n\n\n——————\n    2 In\n      reaching the opposite conclusion, the majority rejects the conces-\nsions by the Government and petitioners and gives no weight to the\nARB’s interpretation. If §1514A creates a cause of action for contractor\nemployees, the majority concludes, so too must it create a cause of\naction for “housekeepers” and “gardeners” against their individual\nemployers if they happen to work for a public company. Ante, at 15. In\nreaching this result, however, the majority only adds to the absurdities\nproduced by its holding. See infra, at 12–13.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Here, two headings strongly suggest that\nCongress intended §1514A to apply only to employees of\npublic companies. First, the title of §806—the section of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act that enacted §1514A—speaks\nclearly to the scope of employees protected by the provi-\nsion: “Protection for Employees of Publicly Traded Com-\npanies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.” 116 Stat. 802.\nSecond, the heading of §1514A(a) reinforces that the pro-\nvision provides “[w]histleblower protection for employees\nof publicly traded companies.”\n   The majority suggests that in covering “employees of\npublicly traded companies,” the headings may be impre-\ncise. Ante, at 16. Section 1514A(a) technically applies to\nthe employees of two types of companies: those “with a\nclass of securities registered under section 12 of the Secu-\nrities Exchange Act of 1934,” and those that are “required\nto file reports under section 15(d) of the” same Act. Both\ntypes of companies are “public” in that they are publicly\nowned. See ante, at 7–8. The difference is that shares of\nthe §12 companies are listed and traded on a national\nsecurities exchange; §15(d) companies, by contrast, ex-\nchange their securities directly with the public. The head-\nings may therefore be inexact in the sense that the phrase\n“publicly traded” is commonly associated with companies\nwhose securities are traded on national exchanges. Con-\ngress, however, had good reason to use the phrase to refer\nto §15(d) companies as well: Section 15(d) companies are\ntraded publicly, too. For instance, as the majority recog-\nnizes, ante, at 20, a mutual fund is one paradigmatic\nexample of a §15(d) company. And mutual funds, like\nother §15(d) companies, are both publicly owned and\nwidely traded; the trades just take place typically between\nthe fund and its investors directly.\n   In any case, even if referring to employees of §12 and\n§15(d) companies together as “employees of publicly traded\n6                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncompanies” may be slightly imprecise, the majority’s com-\npeting interpretation of §1514A would stretch the stat-\nute’s headings far past the point of recognition. As the\nmajority understands the law, Congress used the term\n“employees of publicly traded companies” as shorthand not\njust for (1) employees of §12 and §15(d) companies, but\nalso for (2) household employees of any individual who\nworks for a §12 or §15(d) company; (3) employees of any\nprivate company that contracts with a §12 or §15(d) com-\npany; (4) employees of any private company that, even if\nit does not contract with a public company, subcontracts\nwith a private company that does; and (5) employees of\nany agent of a §12 or §15(d) company. If Congress had\nwanted to enact such a far-reaching provision, it would\nhave called it something other than “[w]histleblower\nprotection for employees of publicly traded companies.”\n    Recognizing that Congress chose headings that are\ninconsistent with its interpretation, the majority notes\nthat the Court has “placed less weight on captions.” Ante,\nat 16. But where the captions favor one interpretation so\ndecisively, their significance should not be dismissed so\nquickly. As we have explained, headings are important\n“ ‘tools available for the resolution of a doubt’ about the\nmeaning of a statute.” Almendarez-Torres v. United\nStates, 523 U. S. 224, 234 (1998).\n                             C\n                             1\n  Statutory context confirms that Congress intended\n§1514A to apply only to employees of public companies.\nTo start, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a whole evinces a\nclear focus on public companies. Congress stated in the\nAct’s preamble that its objective was to “protect investors\nby improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate\ndisclosures made pursuant to the securities laws,” 116\nStat. 745, disclosures that public companies alone must\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nfile. The Act thus created enhanced disclosure obligations\nfor public companies, §401; added new conflict of interest\nrules for their executives, §402; increased the responsibili-\nties of their audit committees, §301; and created new rules\ngoverning insider trading by their executives and direc-\ntors, §306. The common denominator among all of these\nprovisions is their singular focus on the activities of public\ncompanies.\n   When Congress wanted to depart from the Act’s public\ncompany focus to regulate private firms and their employ-\nees, it spoke clearly. For example, §307 of the Act ordered\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue\nrules “setting forth minimum standards of professional\nconduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the\n[SEC],” including a rule requiring outside counsel to re-\nport violations of the securities laws to public company\nofficers and directors. 15 U. S. C. §7245. Similarly, Title I\nof the Act created the Public Company Accounting Over-\nsight Board (PCAOB) and vested it with the authority\nto register, regulate, investigate, and discipline privately\nheld outside accounting firms and their employees.\n§§7211–7215. And Title V required the SEC to adopt rules\ngoverning outside securities analysts when they make\npublic recommendations regarding securities. §78o–6.\n   Section 1514A, by contrast, does not unambiguously\ncover the employees of private businesses that contract\nwith public companies or the employees of individuals who\nwork for public companies. Far from it, for the reasons\nnoted above. Yet as the rest of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\ndemonstrates, if Congress had really wanted §1514A to\nimpose liability upon broad swaths of the private sector, it\nwould have said so more clearly.\n   Congress’ intent to adopt the narrower understanding of\n§1514A is also clear when the statute is compared to the\nwhistleblower provision that served as its model. That\nprovision, enacted as part of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation\n8                    LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nInvestment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, 49\nU. S. C. §42121, provides that “[n]o air carrier or contrac-\ntor or subcontractor of an air carrier” may retaliate\nagainst an employee who reports a potential airline safety\nviolation.\n  Section 42121 protects employees of contractors. But as\nthe majority acknowledges, “Congress strayed” from\n§42121 in significant ways when it wrote §1514A. Ante,\nat 29. First, §42121 specifically defines the term “con-\ntractor,” limiting the term to “a company that performs\nsafety-sensitive functions by contract for an air carrier.”\n§42121(e). That is in notable distinction to §1514A, which\ndoes not define the word “contractor” as a particular type\nof company, instead placing the term in a list alongside\nindividual “officer[s]” and “employee[s]” who act on a\ncompany’s behalf. Second, unlike §42121, §1514A sets off\nthe term “contractor” in a separate clause that is subsidi-\nary to the primary subject of the provision—the public\ncompany itself. Third, the title of §42121 is “[p]rotection of\nemployees providing air safety information,” a title that\ncomfortably encompasses the employees of contractors.\nNot so of §1514A’s headings, as explained above. In short,\n§42121 shows that Congress had an easy-to-follow model if\nit wanted to protect the employees of contractors, yet\nchose to depart from that model in several important\nways. We should not presume that choice to be accidental.\nSee Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S.\n723, 734 (1975).\n                             2\n   The majority relies on statutory context as well, but its\nexamples are unconvincing. It first argues that the types\nof conduct prohibited by the statute—“discharge, demo-\ntion, suspension, threats, harassment, [and] discrimina-\ntion in the terms and conditions of employment”—are\n“commonly actions an employer takes against its own\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

The problem is that §1514A does\nnot forbid retaliation by an “employer”; it forbids retalia-\ntion by a “[public] company . . . or any officer, employee,\ncontractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company.” For\nthe reasons already discussed, Congress could have rea-\nsonably included the five types of representatives not in\ntheir capacity as employers, but rather as representatives\nof the company who are barred from retaliating against a\npublic company’s employees on the company’s behalf.\n   The majority next suggests that contractors are rarely\n“positioned to take adverse actions against employees of\nthe public company with whom they contract.” Ante, at\n10. That misconceives the nature of modern work forces,\nwhich increasingly comprise a mix of contractors and\npersons laboring under more typical employment relation-\nships. For example, public companies often hire “inde-\npendent contractors,” of whom there are more than 10\nmillion,3 and contract workers,4 of whom there are more\nthan 11 million.5 And they employ outside lawyers, ac-\ncountants, and auditors as well.

Otherwise, the statute would have had a\ngaping hole—a public company could evade §1514A simply\nby hiring a contractor to engage in the very retaliatory\nacts that an officer or employee could not.6\n  The majority also too quickly dismisses the prominence\nof “outplacement” firms, or consultants that help compa-\nnies determine whom to fire. See ante, at 11. Companies\nspent $3.6 billion on these services in 2009 alone.7 Con-\n——————\n   6 The majority submits that the hole might not be so problematic\n\nbecause §1514A “surely” prohibits a “public company from directing\nsomeone else to engage in retaliatory conduct against the public com-\npany’s employees.” Ante, at 13. It surely does, but that is the point—\nthe whole reason §1514A(a) clearly does so is because it expressly\nforbids a public company to retaliate against its employees through\n“any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent.” The prohi-\nbition on retaliation through a contractor would be far less certain\n(hence the hole) if Congress had merely forbidden a public company to\nretaliate through its “officers and employees.” Moreover, while the\nmajority concedes that, under the narrower reading of §1514A, Con-\ngress’ inclusion of the term “contractor” imposes secondary liability in\nthe event a public company is judgment proof, ante, at 13, the majority\nfails to recognize that Congress’ use of the term also imposes primary\nliability against contractors who threaten public company employees\nwithout direction from the company. Thus, for example, FMR’s inter-\npretation of §1514A would prevent an outside accountant from threat-\nening or harassing a public company employee who discovers that the\naccountant is defrauding the public company and who seeks to blow the\nwhistle on that fraud.\n   7 Rogers, Do Firing Consultants Really Exist, Slate, Jan. 7, 2010,\n\nwww.slate.com / articles / news_and_politics / explainer/2010/01/getting_\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

See,\ne.g., Kalkunte v.

Ante, at 11, n. 9. The two\nwords are not legally synonymous, however. An outplacement firm and\npublic company might, for example, enter into a contract with a provi-\nsion expressly disclaiming an agency relationship. Moreover, Congress’\nuse of the term “contractor” would in all events have an independent\nand important effect: If Congress had not included the term, no one\ncould be held liable if a contractor were to threaten or harass a public\ncompany employee without the company’s direction. While the major-\nity may speculate that such occurrences are rare, ibid., it is hardly\nunthinkable. See n. 6, supra.\n12                   LAWSON v.

There is no rule that Congress may only\nprovide an affirmative defense if it is available to every\nconceivable defendant.\n                              D\n                              1\n   Finally, the majority’s reading runs afoul of the precept\nthat “interpretations of a statute which would produce\nabsurd results are to be avoided if alternative interpreta-\ntions consistent with the legislative purpose are avail-\nable.” Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U. S. 564,\n575 (1982). The majority’s interpretation transforms\n§1514A into a sweeping source of litigation that Congress\ncould not have intended. As construed by the majority,\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act regulates employment relation-\nships between individuals and their nannies, housekeep-\ners, and caretakers, subjecting individual employers to\nlitigation if their employees claim to have been harassed\nfor providing information regarding any of a host of of-\nfenses. If, for example, a nanny is discharged after ex-\npressing a concern to his employer that the employer’s\nteenage son may be participating in some Internet fraud,\nthe nanny can bring a §1514A suit. The employer may\nprevail, of course, if the nanny cannot prove he was fired\n“because of” the fraud report. §1514A. But there is little\nreason to think Congress intended to sweep such disputes\ninto federal court.\n   Nor is it plausible that Congress intended the Act to\nimpose costly litigation burdens on any private business\nthat happens to have an ongoing contract with a public\ncompany. As the majority acknowledges, the purpose of\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Yet the majority might well embroil\nfederal agencies and courts in the resolution of mundane\nlabor disputes that have nothing to do with such concerns.\nFor instance, a construction worker could file a §1514A\nsuit against her employer (that has a long-term contract\nwith a public company) if the worker is demoted after\nreporting that another client has mailed the company a\nfalse invoice.9\n   The majority’s interpretation also produces truly odd\ndistinctions. Under the rule it announces, a babysitter\ncan bring a §1514A retaliation suit against his employer\nif his employer is a checkout clerk for the local PetSmart\n(a public company), but not if she is a checkout clerk for the\nlocal Petco (a private company). Likewise, the day laborer\nwho works for a construction business can avail himself of\n§1514A if her company has been hired to help remodel the\nlocal Dick’s Sporting Goods store (a public company), but\nnot if it is remodeling a nearby Sports Authority (a private\ncompany).\n   In light of the reasonable alternative reading of §1514A,\nthere is no reason to accept these absurd results. The\nmajority begs to differ, arguing that “[t]here is scant evi-\ndence” that lawsuits have been brought by the multitude\nof newly covered employees “ ‘who have no exposure to\ninvestor-related activities and thus could not possibly\n\n\n——————\n  9 Recognizing that the majority’s reading would lead to a “notably\n\nexpansive scope untethered to the purpose of the statute,” the District\nCourt in this case sought to impose an extratextual limiting principle\nunder which an employee who reports fraud is entitled to protection\nonly if her report “relat[es] to fraud against shareholders.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

The District Court acknowledged,\nhowever, that “the language of the statute itself does not plainly\nprovide such a limiting principle,” id., at 158, and the majority does not\nattempt to revive that limitation here.\n14                  LAWSON v.

Until\ntoday, however, no court has deemed §1514A applicable to\nhousehold employees of individuals who work for public\ncompanies; even the Department of Labor’s ARB rejected\nthat view. Spinner, ALJ No. 2010–SOX–029, at 8. And as\nthe District Court noted, prior to the ARB’s 2012 decision\nin Spinner, the ARB “ha[d] yet to provide . . . definitive\nclarification” on the question whether §1514A extends to\nthe employees of a public company’s private contractors.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

So the fact that\nindividuals and private businesses have yet to suffer\nburdensome litigation offers little assurance that the ma-\njority’s capacious reading of §1514A will produce no un-\ntoward effects.\n  Finally, it must be noted that §1514A protects the re-\nporting of a variety of frauds—not only securities fraud,\nbut also mail, wire, and bank fraud. By interpreting a\nstatute that already protects an expansive class of conduct\nalso to cover a large class of employees, today’s opinion\nthreatens to subject private companies to a costly new\nfront of employment litigation. Congress almost certainly\ndid not intend the statute to have that reach.\n                             2\n   The majority argues that the broader reading of §1514A\nis necessary because a small number of the millions of\nindividuals and private companies affected by its ruling\nhave a special role to play in preventing public company\nfraud. If §1514A does not bar retaliation against employ-\nees of contractors, the majority cautions, then law firms\nand accounting firms will be free to retaliate against their\nemployees when those employees report fraud on the part\nof their public company clients.\n   It is undisputed that Congress was aware of the role\nthat outside accountants and lawyers played in the Enron\ndebacle and the importance of encouraging them to play\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nan active part in preventing future scandals. But it hardly\nfollows that Congress must have meant to apply §1514A to\nevery employee of every public company contractor, sub-\ncontractor, officer, and employee as a result. It is far more\nlikely that Congress saw the unique ethical duties and\nprofessional concerns implicated by outside lawyers and\naccountants as reason to vest regulatory authority in the\nhands of experts with the power to sanction wrongdoers.\n   Specifically, rather than imposing §1514A’s generic\napproach on outside accounting firms, Congress estab-\nlished the PCAOB, which regulates “every detail” of an\naccounting firm’s practice, including “supervision of au-\ndit work,” “internal inspection procedures,” “professional\nethics rules,” and “ ‘such other requirements as the Board\nmay prescribe.’ ” Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 3–4). Importantly, the PCAOB is empowered to\nlevy “severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings, up to\nand including the permanent revocation of a firm’s regis-\ntration . . . and money penalties of $15 million.” Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 4) (citing 15 U. S. C. §7215(c)(4)). Such sanc-\ntions could well provide a more powerful incentive to\nprevent an accounting firm from retaliating against its\nemployees than §1514A.\n   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act confers similar regulatory\nauthority upon the SEC with respect to attorneys. The\nAct requires the SEC to establish rules of professional\nconduct for attorneys, §307 (codified at 15 U. S. C. §7245),\nand confers broad power on the SEC to punish attorneys\nfor “improper professional conduct,” which would include,\nfor example, a law firm partner’s decision to retaliate\nagainst an associate who reports fraud. §602 (codified at\n15 U. S. C. §78d–3). Indeed, the Act grants the SEC the\npower to censure culpable attorneys and to deny “perma-\nnently” to any such attorney the “privilege of appearing of\npracticing before” the SEC “in any way.” §602.\n16                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Congress thus evidently made the judgment that deci-\nsions concerning how best to punish law firms and ac-\ncounting firms ought to be handled not by the Department\nof Labor, but by the SEC and the PCAOB. Such judgment\nshould not be disturbed under usual circumstances, much\nless at the cost to congressional intent produced by today’s\nruling. The majority does offer cogent policy arguments\nfor why Congress might have been wiser to include certain\ntypes of contractors within §1514A, noting for example\nthat a law firm or accounting firm might be able to retali-\nate against its employees for making reports required\nunder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Ante, at 19. But as the\nmajority recognizes, Congress has since remedied that\nprecise concern, enacting a comprehensive whistleblower\nincentive and protection program that unequivocally\n“prohibit[s] any employer”—public or private—“from re-\ntaliating against ‘a whistleblower’ for providing infor-\nmation to the SEC, participating in an SEC proceeding, or\nmaking disclosures required or protected under Sarbanes-\nOxley and certain other securities laws.” Ante, at 26\n(citing 15 U. S. C. §§78u–6(a)(6), (b)(1), (h)). The majority\nthus acknowledges that, moving forward, retaliation\nclaims like the petitioners’ may “procee[d] under [§78u-6],”\nante, at 26, n. 17. In other words, to the extent the major-\nity worries about a “hole” in FMR’s interpretation, ante,\nat 14, Congress has already addressed it.10\n——————\n  10 The majority also contends that its reading is necessary to avoid\n“insulating the entire mutual fund industry from §1514A.” Ante, at 20.\nBut that argument is misguided for a reason similar to the majority’s\nconcern about lawyers and accountants. As this Court has observed,\nCongress responded to the “ ‘potential for abuse inherent in the struc-\nture of investment companies,’ ” Daily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, 464\nU. S. 523, 536 (1984), by enacting the Investment Company Act of 1940\nand the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. 15 U. S. C. §80a–1 et seq.;\n§80b–1 et seq.

S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).11\nUnder United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226–\n227 (2001), an agency may claim Chevron deference “when\nit appears [1] that Congress delegated authority to the\nagency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,\nand [2] that the agency interpretation claiming deference\nwas promulgated in the exercise of that authority.” Nei-\nther requirement is met here.\n   First, the agency interpretation for which petitioners\nclaim deference is the position announced by the ARB, the\nboard to which the Secretary of Labor has delegated au-\nthority “in review or on appeal” in connection with §1514A\nproceedings. 75 Fed. Reg. 3924 (2010). According to\npetitioners, the ARB’s rulings are entitled to deference\nbecause the “Secretary is responsible for enforcing Section\n1514A both through investigation and through formal\nadjudication.” Brief for Petitioners 61. That is right as far\nas it goes, but even if the Secretary has the power to in\n\n——————\n§80b–11. The Act also authorizes fines and imprisonment of up to five\nyears for violations of SEC rules. The SEC thus has broad discretion to\npunish retaliatory actions taken by mutual fund advisers against their\nemployees. And to the extent these provisions may have been insuffi-\ncient to protect mutual fund adviser employees, §78u–6’s extensive\nwhistleblower incentive and protection program now unambiguously\ncovers such employees.\n   11 Although it claims not to reach the issue, ante, at 9, n. 6, the major-\n\nity implicitly declines to defer to a portion of the ARB’s ruling as well,\nrejecting the ARB’s ruling that §1514A does not apply to the household\nemployees of public company officers and employees, ante, at 15, and\nn. 11.\n18                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nvestigate and adjudicate §1514A claims, Congress did not\ndelegate authority to the Secretary to “make rules carry-\ning the force of law,” Mead, 533 U. S., at 226–227. Con-\ngress instead delegated that power to the SEC: Section\n3(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, codified at 15 U. S. C.\n§7202(a), provides that the SEC “shall promulgate such\nrules and regulations, as may be necessary or appropriate\nin the public interest or for the protection of investors, and\nin furtherance of this Act.” So if any agency has the au-\nthority to resolve ambiguities in §1514A with the force\nof law, it is the SEC, not the Department of Labor.\nSee Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review\nComm’n, 499 U. S. 144, 154 (1991). The SEC, however, has\nnot issued a regulation applying §1514A whistleblower\nprotection to employees of public company contractors.\nAnd while the majority notes that the SEC may share the\n(incorrect) view that the Department of Labor has inter-\npretive authority regarding §1514A, ante, at 9, n. 6, the\nmajority cites nothing to suggest that one agency may\ntransfer authority unambiguously delegated to it by Con-\ngress to a different agency simply by signing onto an\namicus brief.\n   That Congress did not intend for the Secretary to re-\nsolve ambiguities in the law is confirmed by §1514A’s\nmechanism for judicial review. The statute does not merely\npermit courts to review the Secretary’s final adjudicatory\nrulings under the Administrative Procedure Act’s defer-\nential standard. It instead allows a claimant to bring an\naction in a federal district court, and allows district courts\nto adjudicate such actions de novo, in any case where the\nSecretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days.\nThat is a conspicuously short amount of time in light of\nthe three-tiered process of agency review of §1514A\nclaims. See ante, at 5–6. As a result, even if Congress had\nnot delegated to the SEC the authority to resolve ambigui-\nties in §1514A, the muscular scheme of judicial review\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          19\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsuggests that Congress would have wanted federal courts,\nand not the Secretary of Labor, to have that power. See\nMead, 533 U. S., at 232 (declining to defer to Customs\nService classifications where, among other things, the\nstatute authorized “independent review of Customs classi-\nfications by the [Court of International Trade]”).\n   As to the second Mead requirement, even if Congress\nhad delegated authority to the Secretary to make “rules\ncarrying the force of law,” the “agency interpretation\nclaiming deference” in this case was not “promulgated in\nthe exercise of that authority.” Id., at 226–227. That is\nbecause the Secretary has explicitly vested any policymak-\ning authority he may have with respect to §1514A in the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\ninstead of the ARB. See 67 Fed. Reg. 65008 (2002). In\nfact, the Secretary has expressly withdrawn from the ARB\nany power to deviate from the rules OSHA issues on the\nDepartment of Labor’s behalf. 75 Fed. Reg. 3925 (“The\n[ARB] shall not have jurisdiction to pass on the validity of\nany portion of the Code of Federal Regulations that has\nbeen duly promulgated by the Department of Labor and\nshall observe the provisions thereof, where pertinent, in\nits decisions”).\n   OSHA has promulgated regulations supporting the\nmajority’s reading of §1514A. See 29 CFR §1980.101(f )–(g)\n(2013). The Secretary, however, has expressly disclaimed\nany claim of deference to them. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 33, n. 8. As a result, the ARB’s\nunderstanding of §1514A’s coverage in Spinner was not an\n“exercise of [the Secretary’s] authority” to make rules\ncarrying the force of law, Mead, 533 U. S., at 226–227, but\nrather the ARB’s necessary compliance with a regulation\nthat no one claims is deserving of deference in the first\nplace. See Spinner, ALJ No. 2010–SOX–029, at 10 (recog-\nnizing that “the ARB is bound by the [Department of\nLabor] regulations”).\n20                  LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  In the absence of Chevron deference, the ARB’s decision\nin Spinner may claim only “respect according to its per-\nsuasiveness” under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S.\n134 (1944). See Mead, 533 U. S., at 221. But the ARB’s\ndecision is unpersuasive, for the many reasons already\ndiscussed.\n                        *    *     *\n   The Court’s interpretation of §1514A undeniably serves\na laudatory purpose. By covering employees of every of-\nficer, employee, and contractor of every public company,\nthe majority’s interpretation extends §1514A’s protections\nto the outside lawyers and accountants who could have\nhelped prevent the Enron fraud.\n   But that is not the statute Congress wrote. Congress\nenvisioned a system in which public company employees\nwould be covered by §1514A, and in which outside law-\nyers, investment advisers, and accountants would be\nregulated by the SEC and PCAOB. Congress did not\nenvision a system in which employees of other private\nbusinesses—such as cleaning and construction company\nworkers who have little interaction with investor-related\nactivities and who are thus ill suited to assist in detecting\nfraud against shareholders—would fall within §1514A.\nNor, needless to say, did it envision §1514A applying to\nthe household employees of millions of individuals who\nhappen to work for public companies—housekeepers,\ngardeners, and babysitters who are also poorly positioned\nto prevent fraud against public company investors. And to\nthe extent §1514A may have been underinclusive as first\ndrafted, Congress has shown itself capable of filling in any\ngaps. See, e.g., Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-\nsumer Protection Act, §§922, 929A, 124 Stat. 1848, 1852\n(extending §1514A to credit rating agencies and public\ncompany subsidiaries); §922, id., at 1841–1848 (codifying\nadditional whistleblower incentive and protection program\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Argued November 12, 2013—Decided March 4, 2014\nTo safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the\n  financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Con-\n  gress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. One of the Act’s provi-\n  sions protects whistleblowers; at the time relevant here, that provi-\n  sion instructed: “No [public] company . . ., or any . . . contractor [or]\n  subcontractor . . . of such company, may discharge, demote, suspend,\n  threaten, harass, or . . . discriminate against an employee in the\n  terms and conditions of employment because of [whistleblowing activ-\n  ity].” 18 U. S. C. §1514A(a).\n     Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees of respond-\n  ents (collectively FMR), private companies that contract to advise or\n  manage mutual funds. As is common in the industry, the mutual\n  funds served by FMR are public companies with no employees. Both\n  plaintiffs allege that they blew the whistle on putative fraud relating\n  to the mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered retaliation by\n  FMR. Each commenced suit in federal court. Moving to dismiss the\n  suits, FMR argued that the plaintiffs could state no claim under\n  §1514A, for that provision protects only employees of public compa-\n  nies, and not employees of private companies that contract with pub-\n  lic companies. On interlocutory appeal from the District Court’s de-\n  nial of FMR’s motion to dismiss, the First Circuit reversed,\n  concluding that the term “an employee” in §1514A(a) refers only to\n  employees of public companies.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.\n670 F. 3d 61, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court, concluding that\n  §1514A’s whistleblower protection includes employees of a public\n2                          LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    company’s private contractors and subcontractors. Pp. 9–29.\n       (a) This reading of §1514A is supported by the provision’s text.\n    Pp. 9–16.\n         (1) The Court looks first to the ordinary meaning of the provi-\n    sion’s language. See Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108. As\n    relevant here, §1514A(a) provides that “no . . . contractor . . . may dis-\n    charge . . . an employee.” The ordinary meaning of “an employee” in\n    this proscription is the contractor’s own employee. FMR’s “narrower\n    construction” requires inserting “of a public company” after “an em-\n    ployee,” but where Congress meant “an employee of a public compa-\n    ny,” it said so.\n       The provision as a whole supports this reading. The prohibited re-\n    taliatory measures enumerated in §1514A(a)—discharge, demotion,\n    suspension, threats, harassment, or discrimination in employment\n    terms and conditions—are actions an employer takes against its own\n    employees. Contractors are not ordinarily positioned to take adverse\n    actions against employees of the public company with whom they\n    contract. FMR’s interpretation of §1514A, therefore, would shrink to\n    insignificance the provision’s ban on retaliation by contractors. The\n    protected activity covered by §1514A, and the provision’s enforcement\n    procedures and remedies, also indicate that Congress presumed an\n    employer-employee relationship between the retaliator and the whis-\n    tleblowing employee. Pp. 9–14.\n         (2) FMR’s textual arguments are unpersuasive. It urges that “an\n    employee” must be read to refer exclusively to public company em-\n    ployees to avoid the absurd result of extending protection to the per-\n    sonal employees of company officers and employees, e.g., their house-\n    keepers or gardeners. This concern appears more theoretical than\n    real and, in any event, is outweighed by the compelling arguments\n    opposing FMR’s reading of §1514A. FMR also urges that its reading\n    is supported by the provision’s statutory headings, but those head-\n    ings are “not meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the\n    text.” Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528.\n    Pp. 14–16.\n       (b) Other considerations support the Court’s textual analysis.\n    Pp. 16–27.\n         (1) The Court’s reading fits §1514A’s aim to ward off another En-\n    ron debacle. The legislative record shows Congress’ understanding\n    that outside professionals bear significant responsibility for reporting\n    fraud by the public companies with whom they contract, and that\n    fear of retaliation was the primary deterrent to such reporting by the\n    employees of Enron’s contractors. Sarbanes-Oxley contains numer-\n    ous provisions designed to control the conduct of accountants, audi-\n    tors, and lawyers who work with public companies, but only §1514A\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  affords such employees protection from retaliation by their employers\n  for complying with the Act’s reporting requirements. Pp. 16–20.\n        (2) This Court’s reading of §1514A avoids insulating the entire\n  mutual fund industry from §1514A. Virtually all mutual funds are\n  structured so that they have no employees of their own; they are\n  managed, instead, by independent investment advisors. Accordingly,\n  the “narrower construction” endorsed by FMR would leave §1514A\n  with no application to mutual funds. The Court’s reading of §1514A,\n  in contrast, protects the employees of investment advisors, who are\n  often the only firsthand witnesses to shareholder fraud involving mu-\n  tual funds. Pp. 20–22.\n        (3) There is scant evidence that today’s decision will open any\n  floodgates for whistleblowing suits outside §1514A’s purposes. The\n  Department of Labor’s regulations have interpreted §1514A as pro-\n  tecting contractor employees for almost a decade, yet FMR is unable\n  to identify a single case in which the employee of a private contractor\n  has asserted a §1514A claim based on allegations unrelated to share-\n  holder fraud. Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General suggest various\n  limiting principles to dispel any overbreadth problems. This Court\n  need not determine §1514A’s bounds here, however, because, if plain-\n  tiffs’ allegations prove true, plaintiffs are precisely the “firsthand\n  witnesses to [the shareholder] fraud” Congress anticipated §1514A\n  would protect.

ZANG,\n        PETITIONERS v. FMR LLC ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n                                [March 4, 2014]\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  To safeguard investors in public companies and restore\ntrust in the financial markets following the collapse of\nEnron Corporation, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, 116 Stat. 745. See S. Rep. No. 107–146,\npp. 2–11 (2002). A provision of the Act, 18 U. S. C.\n§1514A, protects whistleblowers. Section 1514A, at the\ntime here relevant, instructed:\n    “No [public] company . . . , or any officer, employee,\n    contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company,\n    may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass,\n    or in any other manner discriminate against an em-\n    ployee in the terms and conditions of employment be-\n    cause of [whistleblowing or other protected activity].”\n    §1514A(a) (2006 ed.).\nThis case concerns the definition of the protected class:\nDoes §1514A shield only those employed by the public\ncompany itself, or does it shield as well employees of pri-\nvately held contractors and subcontractors—for example,\ninvestment advisers, law firms, accounting enterprises—\nwho perform work for the public company?\n2                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We hold, based on the text of §1514A, the mischief to\nwhich Congress was responding, and earlier legislation\nCongress drew upon, that the provision shelters employees\nof private contractors and subcontractors, just as it shel-\nters employees of the public company served by the con-\ntractors and subcontractors. We first summarize our\nprincipal reasons, then describe this controversy and\nexplain our decision more comprehensively.\n   Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees\nof private companies that contract to advise or manage\nmutual funds. The mutual funds themselves are public\ncompanies that have no employees. Hence, if the whistle\nis to be blown on fraud detrimental to mutual fund inves-\ntors, the whistleblowing employee must be on another\ncompany’s payroll, most likely, the payroll of the mutual\nfund’s investment adviser or manager.\n   Taking the allegations of the complaint as true, both\nplaintiffs blew the whistle on putative fraud relating to\nthe mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered adverse\naction by their employers. Plaintiffs read §1514A to con-\nvey that “[n]o . . . contractor . . . may . . . discriminate\nagainst [its own] employee [for whistleblowing].” We find\nthat reading consistent with the text of the statute and\nwith common sense. Contractors are in control of their\nown employees, but are not ordinarily positioned to control\nsomeone else’s workers. Moreover, we resist attributing to\nCongress a purpose to stop a contractor from retaliating\nagainst whistleblowers employed by the public company\nthe contractor serves, while leaving the contractor free to\nretaliate against its own employees when they reveal\ncorporate fraud.\n   In the Enron scandal that prompted the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct, contractors and subcontractors, including the ac-\ncounting firm Arthur Andersen, participated in Enron’s\nfraud and its coverup. When employees of those contrac-\ntors attempted to bring misconduct to light, they encoun-\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntered retaliation by their employers. The Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct contains numerous provisions aimed at controlling the\nconduct of accountants, auditors, and lawyers who work\nwith public companies. See, e.g., 116 Stat. 750–765, 773–\n774, 784, §§101–107, 203–206, 307. Given Congress’\nconcern about contractor conduct of the kind that contrib-\nuted to Enron’s collapse, we regard with suspicion con-\nstruction of §1514A to protect whistleblowers only when\nthey are employed by a public company, and not when\nthey work for the public company’s contractor.\n   Congress borrowed §1514A’s prohibition against retalia-\ntion from the wording of the 2000 Wendell H. Ford Avia-\ntion Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR\n21), 49 U. S. C. §42121. That Act provides: “No air carrier\nor contractor or subcontractor of an air carrier may dis-\ncharge an employee or otherwise discriminate against an\nemployee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions,\nor privileges of employment” when the employee provides\ninformation regarding violations “relating to air carrier\nsafety” to his or her employer or federal authorities.\n§42121(a)(1). AIR 21 has been read to cover, in addition to\nemployees of air carriers, employees of contractors and\nsubcontractors of the carriers. Given the parallel statu-\ntory texts and whistleblower protective aims, we read\nthe words “an employee” in AIR 21 and in §1514A to have\nsimilar import.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley or Act)\naims to “prevent and punish corporate and criminal fraud,\nprotect the victims of such fraud, preserve evidence of\nsuch fraud, and hold wrongdoers accountable for their\nactions.” S. Rep. No. 107–146, p. 2 (2002) (hereinafter\n4                       LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nS. Rep.).1 Of particular concern to Congress was abundant\nevidence that Enron had succeeded in perpetuating its\nmassive shareholder fraud in large part due to a “corpo-\nrate code of silence”; that code, Congress found, “discour-\nage[d] employees from reporting fraudulent behavior not\nonly to the proper authorities, such as the FBI and the\nSEC, but even internally.” Id., at 4–5 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). When employees of Enron and its ac-\ncounting firm, Arthur Andersen, attempted to report\ncorporate misconduct, Congress learned, they faced retali-\nation, including discharge. As outside counsel advised\ncompany officials at the time, Enron’s efforts to “quiet”\nwhistleblowers generally were not proscribed under then-\nexisting law. Id., at 5, 10. Congress identified the lack of\nwhistleblower protection as “a significant deficiency” in\nthe law, for in complex securities fraud investigations,\nemployees “are [often] the only firsthand witnesses to the\nfraud.” Id., at 10.\n  Section 806 of Sarbanes-Oxley addresses this concern.\nTitled “Protection for Employees of Publicly Traded Com-\npanies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud,” §806 added a new\nprovision to Title 18 of the United States Code, 18 U. S. C.\n§1514A, which reads in relevant part:\n     “Civil action to protect against retaliation in\n     fraud cases\n     “(a) WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES\n——————\n  1 Title VIII of the Act, which contains the whistleblower protection\n\nprovision at issue in this case, was authored by Senators Leahy and\nGrassley and originally constituted a discrete bill, S. 2010. We thus\nlook to the Senate Report for S. 2010, S. Rep. No. 107–146, as the\nSenate Report relevant here. See 148 Cong. Rec. S7418 (daily ed. July\n26, 2002) (statement of Sen. Leahy) (“unanimous consent” to “includ[e]\nin the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD as part of the official legislative history”\nof Sarbanes-Oxley that Title VIII’s “terms track almost exactly the\nprovisions of S. 2010, introduced by Senator Leahy and reported\nunanimously from the Committee on the Judiciary”).\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Plaintiffs do not fall in either category and, in any\nevent, their claims are governed by the prior version of §1514A. Unless\notherwise noted, all citations to §1514A are to the original text in the\n2006 edition of the United States Code.\n6                   LAWSON v.

OSHA’s\norder may be appealed to an administrative law judge,\nand then to DOL’s Administrative Review Board (ARB).\n29 CFR §§1980.104 to 1980.110 (2011).\n   In common with other whistleblower protection provi-\nsions enforced by DOL, see 77 Fed. Reg. 3912 (2012), the\nARB’s determination on a §1514A claim constitutes the\nagency’s final decision and is reviewable in federal court\nunder the standards stated in the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act, 5 U. S. C. §706. If, however, the ARB does not\nissue a final decision within 180 days of the filing of the\ncomplaint, and the delay is not due to bad faith on the\nclaimant’s part, the claimant may proceed to federal dis-\ntrict court for de novo review. 18 U.

An\nemployee prevailing in a proceeding under §1514A is\nentitled to “all relief necessary to make the employee\nwhole,” including “reinstatement with the same seniority\nstatus that the employee would have had, but for the\ndiscrimination,” backpay with interest, and compensation\nfor litigation costs. §1514A(c).\n   Congress modeled §1514A on the anti-retaliation provi-\nsion of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and\nReform Act for the 21st Century (AIR 21), 49 U. S. C.\n§42121, a measure enacted two years earlier. See S.

Instead, they contract with investment\nadvisers like respondents to handle their day-to-day oper-\nations, which include making investment decisions, pre-\nparing reports for shareholders, and filing reports with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Lawson was\nemployed by Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC, a subsidi-\nary of FMR Corp., which was succeeded by FMR LLC.\nZang was employed by a different FMR LLC subsidiary,\nFidelity Management & Research Co., and later by one of\nthat company’s subsidiaries, FMR Co., Inc. For conven-\nience, we refer to respondents collectively as FMR.\n   Lawson worked for FMR for 14 years, eventually serv-\ning as a Senior Director of Finance. She alleges that, after\nshe raised concerns about certain cost accounting method-\nologies, believing that they overstated expenses associated\nwith operating the mutual funds, she suffered a series\nof adverse actions, ultimately amounting to constructive\ndischarge. Zang was employed by FMR for eight years,\nmost recently as a portfolio manager for several of the\nfunds. He alleges that he was fired in retaliation for\nraising concerns about inaccuracies in a draft SEC reg-\nistration statement concerning certain Fidelity funds.\nLawson and Zang separately filed administrative com-\nplaints alleging retaliation proscribed by §1514A. After\nexpiration of the 180-day period specified in §1514A(b)(1),\nLawson and Zang each filed suit in the U. S. District\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts.\n   FMR moved to dismiss the suits, arguing, as relevant,\nthat neither plaintiff has a claim for relief under §1514A.\nFMR is privately held, and maintained that §1514A pro-\ntects only employees of public companies—i.e., companies\nthat either have “a class of securities registered under\nsection 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,” or that\nare “required to file reports under section 15(d)” of that\n8                       LAWSON v.

Supp. 2d 141\n(Mass. 2010).\n   On interlocutory appeal, a divided panel of the First\nCircuit reversed. 670 F. 3d 61 (2012). The Court of Ap-\npeals majority acknowledged that FMR is a “contractor”4\nwithin the meaning of §1514A(a), and thus among the\nactors prohibited from retaliating against “an employee”\nwho engages in protected activity. The majority agreed\nwith FMR, however, that “an employee” refers only to\nemployees of public companies and does not cover a con-\ntractor’s own employees. Id., at 68–80. Judge Thompson\ndissented. In her view, the majority had “impose[d] an\nunwarranted restriction on the intentionally broad lan-\nguage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act” and “bar[red] a signifi-\ncant class of potential securities-fraud whistleblowers\nfrom any legal protection.” Id., at 83.\n   Several months later, the ARB issued a decision in an\nunrelated case, Spinner v. David Landau & Assoc., LLC,\nNo. 10–111 etc., ALJ No. 2010–SOX–029 (May 31, 2012),5\ndisagreeing with the Court of Appeals’ interpretation of\n§1514A. In a comprehensive opinion, the ARB explained\nits position that §1514A affords whistleblower protection\nto employees of privately held contractors that render\nservices to public companies. Ibid.6\n——————\n    3 Here,as just noted, the public company has no employees.

As Judge Thompson observed in her dissent\nfrom the Court of Appeals’ judgment, “boiling [§1514A(a)]\ndown to its relevant syntactic elements, it provides that\n‘no . . . contractor . . . may discharge . . . an employee.’ ”\n670 F. 3d, at 84 (quoting §1514A(a)). The ordinary mean-\ning of “an employee” in this proscription is the contractor’s\nown employee.\n  FMR’s interpretation of the text requires insertion of\n“of a public company” after “an employee.” But where Con-\ngress meant “an employee of a public company,” it said so:\nWith respect to the actors governed by §1514A, the provi-\n——————\nthe Department of Labor.” Post, at 18. Because we agree with the\nARB’s conclusion that §1514A affords protection to a contractor’s\nemployees, we need not decide what weight that conclusion should\ncarry. We note, however, that the SEC apparently does not share the\ndissent’s view that it, rather than DOL, has interpretive authority over\n§1514A. To the contrary, the SEC is a signatory to the Government’s\nbrief in this case, which takes the position that Congress has charged\nthe Secretary of Labor with interpreting §1514A. Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 9–11, 31–34. That view is hardly surprising\ngiven the lead role played by DOL in administering whistleblower\nstatutes. See supra, at 5. The dissent observes that the SEC “has\nnot issued a regulation applying §1514A whistleblower protection to\nemployees of public company contractors,” post, at 18, but omits to\ninform that the SEC has not promulgated any regulations interpreting\n§1514A, consistent with its view that Congress delegated that respon-\nsibility to DOL.\n10                    LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nsion’s interdictions run to the officers, employees, contrac-\ntors, subcontractors, and agents “of such company,” i.e., a\npublic company. §1514A(a). Another anti-retaliation pro-\nvision in Sarbanes-Oxley provides: “[A] broker or dealer\nand persons employed by a broker or dealer who are\ninvolved with investment banking activities may not,\ndirectly or indirectly, retaliate against or threaten to\nretaliate against any securities analyst employed by that\nbroker or dealer or its affiliates . . . .” 15 U. S. C. §78o–\n6(a)(1)(C) (emphasis added). In contrast, nothing in\n§1514A’s language confines the class of employees protected\nto those of a designated employer. Absent any textual\nqualification, we presume the operative language means\nwhat it appears to mean: A contractor may not retaliate\nagainst its own employee for engaging in protected whistle-\nblowing activity.7\n   Section 1514A’s application to contractor employees\nis confirmed when we enlarge our view from the term\n“an employee” to the provision as a whole. The prohib-\nited retaliatory measures enumerated in §1514A(a)—\ndischarge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, or dis-\ncrimination in the terms and conditions of employment—\nare commonly actions an employer takes against its\nown employees. Contractors are not ordinarily posi-\ntioned to take adverse actions against employees of the\npublic company with whom they contract. FMR’s inter-\npretation of §1514A, therefore, would shrink to insignifi-\ncance the provision’s ban on retaliation by contractors.\nThe dissent embraces FMR’s “narrower” construction. See\npost, at 2, 3, 4, 7.\n   FMR urges that Congress included contractors in\n§1514A’s list of governed actors simply to prevent public\n——————\n  7 We need not decide in this case whether §1514A also prohibits a\n\ncontractor from retaliating against an employee of one of the other\nactors governed by the provision.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

FMR describes\nsuch a contractor as an “ax-wielding specialist,” illustrated\nby George Clooney’s character in the movie Up in the Air.8\nBrief for Respondents 24–25 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). As portrayed by Clooney, an ax-wielding special-\nist is a contractor engaged only as the bearer of the bad\nnews that the employee has been fired; he plays no role in\ndeciding who to terminate. If the company employing the\nax-wielder chose the recipients of the bad tidings for retal-\niatory reasons, the §1514A claim would properly be di-\nrected at the company. Hiring the ax-wielder would not\ninsulate the company from liability. Moreover, we see no\nindication that retaliatory ax-wielding specialists are the\nreal-world problem that prompted Congress to add con-\ntractors to §1514A.9\n   Moving further through §1514A to the protected activity\ndescribed in subsection (a)(1), we find further reason to\n——————\n  8 This hypothetical originates in a Seventh Circuit opinion, Fleszar v.\nUnited States Dept. of Labor, 598 F. 3d 912, 915 (2010), and is men-\ntioned in a footnote in the First Circuit’s opinion in this case, 670 F. 3d\n61, 69, n. 11 (2012).\n   9 When asked during oral argument for an example of actual circum-\n\nstances in which a contractor would have employment decisionmak-\ning authority over public company employees, FMR’s counsel cited\nKalkunte v.

That case involved a\nbankrupt public company that hired a private company to handle its\ndissolution. The ARB found the private company liable under §1514A\nbecause it acted as a “contractor, subcontractor, or agent” of the public\ncompany in discharging the claimant. ALJ No. 2004–SOX–056, at 10\n(emphasis added). Neither FMR nor its amici have pointed us to any\nactual situation in which a public company employee would be vulner-\nable to retaliatory conduct by a contractor not already covered as an\n“agent” under §1514A. Notably, even in Tides v. The Boeing Co., 644\nF. 3d 809 (CA9 2011), the case cited by the dissent for the proposition\nthat contractors may possess “managerial authority” over public\ncompany employees, post, at 10, the alleged retaliation was by the\npublic company itself.\n12                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbelieve that Congress presumed an employer-employee\nrelationship between the retaliator and the whistleblower.\nEmployees gain protection for furnishing information to a\nfederal agency, Congress, or “a person with supervisory\nauthority over the employee (or such other person working\nfor the employer who has the authority to investigate,\ndiscover, or terminate misconduct).” §1514A(a)(1) (em-\nphasis added). And under §1514A(a)(2), employees are\nprotected from retaliation for assisting “in a proceeding\nfiled or about to be filed (with any knowledge of the em-\nployer) relating to an alleged violation” of any of the enu-\nmerated fraud provisions, securities regulations, or other\nfederal law relating to shareholder fraud. §1514A(a)(2)\n(emphasis added). The reference to employer knowledge is\nan additional indicator of Congress’ expectation that the\nretaliator typically will be the employee’s employer, not\nanother entity less likely to know of whistleblower com-\nplaints filed or about to be filed.\n   Section 1514A’s enforcement procedures and remedies\nsimilarly contemplate that the whistleblower is an em-\nployee of the retaliator. As earlier noted, see supra, at 6,\n§1514A(b)(2)(A) provides that a claim under §1514A “shall\nbe governed under the rules and procedures set forth in\nsection 42121(b) of title 49,” i.e., AIR 21’s anti-retaliation\nprovision. Throughout §42121(b), the respondent is re-\nferred to as “the employer.” See 49 U. S. C. §42121(b)(2)\n(B)(ii) (The Secretary shall not conduct an investigation\ninto a retaliation claim “if the employer demonstrates,\nby clear and convincing evidence, that the employer would\nhave taken the same unfavorable personnel action in\nthe absence of that behavior.”); §42121(b)(2)(B)(iv)\n(“Relief may not be ordered . . . if the employer demon-\nstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the employer\nwould have taken the same unfavorable personnel action\nin the absence of that behavior.”).\n   Regarding remedies, §1514A(c)(2) states that a success-\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nful claimant shall be entitled to “reinstatement with the\nsame seniority status that the employee would have had,\nbut for the discrimination,” as well as “the amount of back\npay, with interest.” As the Solicitor General, for the United\nStates as amicus curiae, observed, “It is difficult, if not\nimpossible, to see how a contractor or subcontractor could\nprovide those remedies to an employee of a public company.”\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15. The most\nsensible reading of §1514A’s numerous references to an\nemployer-employee relationship between the respondent\nand the claimant is that the provision’s protections run\nbetween contractors and their own employees.\n   Remarkably, the dissent attributes to Congress a\nstrange design. Under the dissent’s “narrower” construc-\ntion, post, at 2, 3, 4, 7, a public company’s contractor may\nnot retaliate against a public company’s employees, aca-\ndemic here because the public company has no employees.\nAccording to the dissent, this coverage is necessary to\nprevent “a gaping hole” that would allow public companies\nto “evade §1514A simply by hiring a contractor to engage\nin the very retaliatory acts that an officer or employee\ncould not.” Post, at 10. This cannot be right—even if\nCongress had omitted any reference to contractors, sub-\ncontractors, or agents in §1514A, the remaining language\nsurely would prohibit a public company from directing\nsomeone else to engage in retaliatory conduct against the\npublic company’s employees; hiring an ax-wielder to an-\nnounce an employee’s demotion does not change the fact\nthat the public company is the entity commanding the\ndemotion. Under the dissent’s reading of §1514A, the\ninclusion of contractors as covered employers does no more\nthan make the contractor secondarily liable for complying\nwith such marching orders—hardly a hole at all.10\n——————\n   10 The dissent suggests that we “fai[l] to recognize” that its construc-\n\ntion also makes contractors primarily liable for retaliating of their own\n14                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   There would be a huge hole, on the other hand, were the\ndissent’s view of §1514A’s reach to prevail: Contractors’\nemployees would be disarmed; they would be vulnerable\nto retaliation by their employers for blowing the whistle\non a scheme to defraud the public company’s investors,\neven a scheme engineered entirely by the contractor. Not\nonly would mutual fund advisers and managers escape\n§1514A’s control. Legions of accountants and lawyers\nwould be denied §1514A’s protections. See infra, at 19–22.\nInstead of indulging in fanciful visions of whistleblowing\nbabysitters and the like, post, at 1–2, 6, 12–13, 20, the\ndissent might pause to consider whether a Congress,\nprompted by the Enron debacle, would exclude from whis-\ntleblower protection countless professionals equipped to\nbring fraud on investors to a halt.\n                             B\n  We turn next to two textual arguments made by FMR.\nFirst, FMR urges that “an employee” must be read to refer\nexclusively to public company employees to avoid the\nabsurd result of extending protection to the personal\nemployees of company officers and employees, e.g., their\nhousekeepers or gardeners. See Brief for Respondents 19–\n20; post, at 1–2, 6, 12–13, 20. Plaintiffs and the Solicitor\nGeneral do not defend §1514A’s application to personal\nemployees. They argue, instead, that the prohibition\nagainst an “officer” or “employee” retaliating against “an\nemployee” may be read as imposing personal liability only\non officers and employees who retaliate against other\npublic company employees. Brief for Petitioners 12; Brief\n\n—————— \n\nvolition against employees of public companies. Post, at 10, n. 6. As \n\nexplained supra, at 11–12, n. 9, however, FMR and its supporters have\n\nidentified not even one real-world instance of a public company employee\n\nasserting a §1514A claim alleging retaliatory conduct by a contractor.\n\nAgain, no “gaping hole,” practically no hole at all.\n\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 16.11 FMR calls this\nreading “bizarre,” for it would ascribe to the words “an\nemployee” in §1514A(a) “one meaning if the respondent is\nan ‘officer’ and a different meaning if the respondent is a\n‘contractor.’ ” Brief for Respondents 20–21.\n   We agree with FMR that plaintiffs and the Solicitor\nGeneral offer an interpretation at odds with the text Con-\ngress enacted. If, as we hold, “an employee” includes\nemployees of contractors, then grammatically, the term\nalso includes employees of public company officers and\nemployees. Nothing suggests Congress’ attention was\ndrawn to the curiosity its drafting produced. The issue,\nhowever, is likely more theoretical than real. Few house-\nkeepers or gardeners, we suspect, are likely to come upon\nand comprehend evidence of their employer’s complicity in\nfraud. In any event, FMR’s point is outweighed by the\ncompelling arguments opposing FMR’s contention that “an\nemployee” refers simply and only to public company em-\nployees. See supra, at 9–14. See also infra, at 23–24\n(limiting principles may serve as check against overbroad\napplications).\n     Second, FMR argues that the statutory headings\nsupport the exclusion of contractor employees from\n§1514A’s protections. Although §1514A’s own heading is\nbroad (“Civil action to protect against retaliation in fraud\ncases”), subsection (a) is captioned “Whistleblower Protec-\ntion for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies.” Simi-\nlarly, the relevant public law section, §806 of Sarbanes-\nOxley, is captioned “Protection for Employees of Publicly\nTraded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.” 116\n——————\n   11 The ARB endorsed this view in Spinner v. David Landau & Assoc.,\n\nLLC, No. 10–111 etc., ALJ No. 2010–SOX–029, p. 8 (May 31, 2012). We\nhave no occasion to determine whether the ARB would be entitled to\ndeference in this regard, for, as explained in text, we find that the\nstatutory text unambiguously affords protection to personal employees\nof public company officers and employees. §1514A(a).\n16                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nStat. 802. The Court of Appeals described the latter two\nheadings as “explicit guides” limiting protection under\n§1514A to employees of public companies. 670 F. 3d, at\n69.\n   This Court has placed less weight on captions. In\nTrainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519\n(1947), we explained that where, as here, “the [statutory]\ntext is complicated and prolific, headings and titles can do\nno more than indicate the provisions in a most general\nmanner.” Id., at 528. The under-inclusiveness of the two\nheadings relied on by the Court of Appeals is apparent.\nThe provision indisputably extends protection to employ-\nees of companies that file reports with the SEC pursuant\nto §15(d) of the 1934 Act, even when such companies are\nnot “publicly traded.” And the activity protected under\n§1514A is not limited to “provid[ing] evidence of fraud”; it\nalso includes reporting violations of SEC rules or regula-\ntions. §1514A(a)(1). As in Trainmen, the headings here\nare “but a short-hand reference to the general subject\nmatter” of the provision, “not meant to take the place of\nthe detailed provisions of the text.” 331 U. S., at 528.\nSection 1514A is attended by numerous indicators that the\nstatute’s prohibitions govern the relationship between a\ncontractor and its own employees; we do not read the\nheadings to “undo or limit” those signals. Id., at 529.12\n                            III\n\n                             A\n\n   Our textual analysis of §1514A fits the provision’s pur-\npose.

And, as the ARB observed in Spinner, “Congress\nplainly recognized that outside professionals—ac-\ncountants, law firms, contractors, agents, and the like—\nwere complicit in, if not integral to, the shareholder fraud\nand subsequent cover-up [Enron] officers . . . perpetrated.”\nALJ No. 2010–SOX–029, pp. 12–13. Indeed, the Senate\nReport demonstrates that Congress was as focused on the\nrole of Enron’s outside contractors in facilitating the fraud\nas it was on the actions of Enron’s own officers. See, e.g.,\nS. Rep., at 3 (fraud “occurred with extensive participation\nand structuring advice from Arthur Andersen . . . which\nwas simultaneously serving as both consultant and inde-\npendent auditor for Enron” (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted)); id., at 4 (“professionals from account-\ning firms, law firms and business consulting firms, who\nwere paid millions to advise Enron on these practices,\nassured others that Enron was a solid investment”); id., at\n4–5 (team of Andersen employees were tasked with de-\nstroying “physical evidence and documents” relating to\nEnron’s fraud); id., at 5 (“Enron and Andersen were taking\nadvantage of a system that allowed them to behave in an\napparently fraudulent manner”); id., at 11 (Enron’s fraud\npartly attributable to “the well-paid professionals who\nhelped create, carry out, and cover up the complicated\ncorporate ruse when they should have been raising con-\ncerns”); id., at 20–21 (“Enron’s accountants and lawyers\nbrought all their skills and knowledge to bear in assisting\nthe fraud to succeed and then in covering it up.”).\n  Also clear from the legislative record is Congress’ under-\nstanding that outside professionals bear significant re-\nsponsibility for reporting fraud by the public companies\nwith whom they contract, and that fear of retaliation was\nthe primary deterrent to such reporting by the employ-\nees of Enron’s contractors. Congressional investigators\ndiscovered ample evidence of contractors demoting or dis-\n18                 LAWSON v.

See, e.g., Oppel,\nMerrill Replaced Research Analyst Who Upset Enron,\nN. Y. Times, July 30, 2002, p. A1 (“In the summer of 1998,\nwhen it was eager to win more investment banking busi-\nness from Enron, Merrill Lynch replaced a research ana-\nlyst who had angered Enron executives by rating the\ncompany’s stock ‘neutral’ with an analyst who soon up-\ngraded the rating, according to Congressional investi-\ngators.”); Yost, Andersen Whistleblower Was Removed,\nAssociated Press (Apr. 3, 2002) (Congressional investiga-\ntion reveals that Andersen removed one of its partners\nfrom its Enron team after Enron officials expressed un-\nhappiness with the partner’s questioning of certain ac-\ncounting practices); Oppel, The Man Who Paid the Price\nfor Sizing up Enron, N.

Emphasizing the importance of outside profes-\nsionals as “gatekeepers who detect and deter fraud,” the\nSenate Report concludes: “Congress must reconsider the\nincentive system that has been set up that encourages\naccountants and lawyers who come across fraud in their\nwork to remain silent.” Id., at 20–21.

In\nparticular, FMR points to sections of the Act requiring\naccountants and lawyers for public companies to investi-\ngate and report misconduct, or risk being banned from\nfurther practice before the SEC. Id., at 41 (citing 15\nU. S. C. §§7215(c)(4), 7245). These requirements, however,\nindicate why Congress would have wanted to extend\n§1514A’s coverage to the many lawyers and accountants\nwho perform outside work for public companies. Although\nlawyers and accountants are subject to extensive regula-\ntions and sanctions throughout Sarbanes-Oxley, no provi-\nsion of the Act other than §1514A affords them protection\nfrom retaliation by their employers for complying with the\nAct’s reporting requirements.14 In short, we cannot coun-\n——————\n  13 FMR urges that the Senate Report’s references to “employees of\n\npublicly traded companies” demonstrate that Congress wanted to limit\nwhistleblower protection to such employees. Brief for Respondents 30–\n31. This argument fails for the same reason that FMR’s reliance on the\nstatutory section headings fails: “employees of publicly traded compa-\nnies” must be understood as shorthand not designed to capture every\nemployee covered by §1514A. See supra, at 15–16. Senator Sarbanes’\nstatement, cited in the concurring opinion, post, at 2, is similarly\nimprecise. The Act indisputably covers private accounting firms and\nlaw firms that provide services to public companies. See, e.g., 15 U. S.\nC. §§7215, 7245. Indeed, Senator Sarbanes acknowledged this point in\nhis very next sentence. See 148 Cong. Rec. 14440 (2002) (remarks of\nSen. Sarbanes) (“This legislation prohibits accounting firms from\nproviding certain specified consulting services if they are also the\nauditors of the company.”).\n  14 The dissent suggests that the Public Company Accounting Oversight\n20                      LAWSON v.

As companies\n“required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securi-\nties Exchange Act of 1934,” 18 U. S. C. §1514A(a), mutual\nfunds unquestionably are governed by §1514A. Because\nmutual funds figure prominently among such report-filing\ncompanies, Congress presumably had them in mind when\nit added to “publicly traded companies” the discrete cate-\ngory of companies “required to file reports under section\n15(d).”\n   Virtually all mutual funds are structured so that they\nhave no employees of their own; they are managed, in-\nstead, by independent investment advisers. See S. Rep.\nNo. 91–184, p. 5 (1969) (accompanying the 1970 amend-\nments to the Investment Company Act of 1940). The\nUnited States investment advising industry manages\n$14.7 trillion on behalf of nearly 94 million investors. See\n2013 Investment Company Fact Book 7 (53d ed.), availa-\nble at http://www.icifactbook.org/pdf/2013_factbook.pdf (as\nvisited Feb. 20, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). These investment advisers, under our reading\n\n—————— \n\nBoard’s and the SEC’s authority to sanction unprofessional conduct by \n\naccountants and lawyers, respectively, “could well provide” a disincen-\ntive to retaliate against other accountants and lawyers. See post, at 15.\n\nThe possibility of such sanctions, however, is cold comfort to the ac-\ncountant or lawyer who loses her job in retaliation for her efforts to \n\ncomply with the Act’s requirements if, as the dissent would have it,\n\n§1514A does not enable her to seek reinstatement or backpay. \n\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

This construction protects the “insiders [who]\nare the only firsthand witnesses to the [shareholder]\nfraud.” S. Rep., at 10. Under FMR’s and the dissent’s\nreading, in contrast, §1514A has no application to mutual\nfunds, for all of the potential whistleblowers are employed\nby the privately held investment management companies,\nnot by the mutual funds themselves. See Brief for Re-\nspondents 45 (describing this glaring gap as “merely a\nconsequence of the corporate structure” of mutual funds).\n  The Court of Appeals found exclusion of the mutual\nfund industry from §1514A tenable because mutual funds\nand their investment advisers are separately regulated\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.

But\nthis separate regulation does not remove the problem, for\nnowhere else in these legislative measures are investment\nmanagement employees afforded whistleblower protection.\nSection 1514A alone shields them from retaliation for\nbringing fraud to light.\n  Indeed, affording whistleblower protection to mutual\nfund investment advisers is crucial to Sarbanes-Oxley’s\nendeavor to “protect investors by improving the accuracy\nand reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to\nthe securities laws.” 116 Stat. 745. As plaintiffs observe,\nthese disclosures are written, not by anyone at the mutual\nfunds themselves, but by employees of the investment\nadvisers. “Under FMR’s [and the dissent’s] proposed in-\nterpretation of section 1514A, FMR could dismiss any\nFMR employee who disclosed to the directors of or lawyers\nfor the Fidelity funds that there were material falsehoods\nin the documents being filed by FMR with the SEC in the\nname of those funds.” Reply Brief 13.

See post, at 1–2, 6,\n12–13, 20–21. FMR’s amici also press this point, observ-\ning that the activity protected under §1514A(a)(1) encom-\npasses reporting not only securities fraud (18 U. S. C.\n§1348), but also mail, wire, and bank fraud (§§1341, 1343,\n1344). Including contractor employees in the protected\nclass, they therefore assert, could “cas[t] a wide net over\nemployees who have no exposure to investor-related activ-\nities and thus could not possibly assist in detecting inves-\ntor fraud.” Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United\nStates of America as Amicus Curiae 3. See also Brief for\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets Association as\nAmicus Curiae 7–16.\n   There is scant evidence, however, that these floodgate-\nopening concerns are more than hypothetical. DOL’s\nregulations have interpreted §1514A as protecting con-\ntractor employees for almost a decade.15 See 69 Fed. Reg.\n52105–52106 (2004).

The dissent’s fears that household employ-\nees and others, on learning of today’s decision, will be\nprompted to pursue retaliation claims, post, at 13, and\nthat OSHA will find them meritorious under §1514A,\nseem to us unwarranted. If we are wrong, however, Con-\ngress can easily fix the problem by amending §1514A\nexplicitly to remove personal employees of public company\nofficers and employees from the provision’s reach. But it\nwould thwart Congress’ dominant aim if contractors were\ntaken off the hook for retaliating against their whistle-\nblowing employees, just to avoid the unlikely prospect that\nbabysitters, nannies, gardeners, and the like will flood\nOSHA with §1514A complaints.\n  Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General observe that over-\nbreadth problems may be resolved by various limit-\ning principles.      They point specifically to the word\n“contractor.” Plaintiffs note that in “common parlance,”\n“contractor” does not extend to every fleeting business\nrelationship. Instead, the word “refers to a party whose\nperformance of a contract will take place over a significant\nperiod of time.” Reply Brief 16. See also Fleszar v.

This alleged fraud directly impli-\ncates the funds’ shareholders: “By inflating its expenses,\nand thus understating its profits, [FMR] could potentially\nincrease the fees it would earn from the mutual funds, fees\nultimately paid by the shareholders of those funds.” Brief\nfor Petitioners 3. Zang alleges that he was fired for ex-\npressing concerns about inaccuracies in a draft registra-\ntion statement FMR prepared for the SEC on behalf of\ncertain Fidelity funds. The potential impact on share-\nholders of false or misleading registration statements\nneeds no elaboration. If Lawson and Zang’s allegations\nprove true, these plaintiffs would indeed be “firsthand\nwitnesses to [the shareholder] fraud” Congress anticipated\n§1514A would protect. S. Rep., at 10.\n                           D\n  FMR urges that legislative events subsequent to\nSarbanes-Oxley’s enactment show that Congress did not\nintend to extend §1514A’s protections to contractor em-\nployees.16 In particular, FMR calls our attention to the\n——————\n  16 We can easily dismiss FMR’s invocation of a failed bill from 2004,\n\nthe Mutual Fund Reform Act, S. 2059, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., §116(b),\nwhich would have amended §1514A explicitly to cover employees of\ninvestment advisers and affiliates.

Dodd-Frank\namended §1514A(a) to read:\n     “No company with a class of securities registered un-\n     der section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n     (15 U. S. C. 78l), or that is required to file reports un-\n     der [section 12] of the [1934 Act] (15 U. S.

(emphasis added; foot-\n     note omitted.)\n  The amended provision extends §1514A’s protection to\nemployees of public company subsidiaries and nationally\nrecognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs).\nFMR asserts that Congress’ decision to add NRSROs to\n§1514A shows that the provision did not previously cover\ncontractor employees: “If [§1514A] already covered every\nprivate company contracting with a public company, there\nwould have been no need for Congress to extend [§1514A]\nto certain private companies.” Brief for Respondents 35–\n36.

Id., at 36.\n   We see nothing useful to our inquiry in Congress’ deci-\nsion to amend §1514A to include public company sub-\nsidiaries and NRSROs. More telling, at the time of the\nDodd-Frank amendments, DOL regulations provided that\n§1514A protects contractor employees.         See 29 CFR\n§1980.101 (2009). Congress included in its alterations no\nlanguage gainsaying that protection. As Judge Thomp-\nson’s dissent from the First Circuit’s judgment observes,\n“Congress had a miles-wide opening to nip [DOL’s] regula-\ntion in the bud if it had wished to do so. It did not.” 670\nF. 3d, at 88.\n   Dodd-Frank also establishes a corporate whistleblowing\nreward program, accompanied by a new provision pro-\nhibiting any employer from retaliating against “a whistle-\nblower” for providing information to the SEC, participating\nin an SEC proceeding, or making disclosures required\nor protected under Sarbanes-Oxley and certain other\nsecurities laws. 15 U. S. C. §78u–6(a)(6), (b)(1), (h). FMR\nurges that, as this provision covers employees of all com-\npanies, public or private, “[t]here is no justification” for\nreading §1514A to cover employees of contractors: “Any\n‘gap’ that might, arguendo, have existed for employees of\nprivate entities between 2002 and 2010 has now been\nclosed.” Brief for Respondents 44.17\n   FMR, we note, somewhat overstates Dodd-Frank’s cov-\nerage.

It is, instead, to de-\ntermine whether Congress afforded protection to contractor\nemployees when it enacted §1514A in 2002. If anything\nrelevant to our inquiry can be gleaned from Dodd-Frank,\nit is that Congress apparently does not share FMR’s\nconcerns about extending protection comprehensively\nto corporate whistleblowers.18\n                              IV\n   We end by returning to AIR 21’s whistleblower protec-\ntion provision, 49 U. S. C. §42121, enacted two years\nbefore Sarbanes-Oxley. Congress designed §1514A to\n“track . . . as closely as possible” the protections afforded\nby §42121. S. Rep., at 30. To this end, §1514A incorpo-\nrates by cross-reference §42121’s administrative enforce-\nment regime, see 18 U. S. C. §1514A(b)(2), and contains\nparallel statutory text. Compare §1514A(a) (“No [public]\ncompany . . . or any officer, employee, contractor, subcon-\ntractor, or agent of such company, may discharge, demote,\nsuspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner dis-\ncriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions\nof employment” for engaging in protected activity) with 49\nU.

C. §42121(a) (“No air carrier or contractor or subcon-\ntractor of an air carrier may discharge an employee or\notherwise discriminate against an employee with respect\n——————\n   18 Section 1107 of the Act is of similar breadth, declaring it a criminal\n\noffense to “tak[e] any action harmful to any person, including interfer-\nence with the lawful employment or livelihood of any person, for provid-\ning to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the\ncommission or possible commission of any Federal offense.” 18 U.

FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nto compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of em-\nployment” for engaging in protected activity).19\n   Section 42121 has been read to protect employees of\ncontractors covered by the provision. The ARB has con-\nsistently construed AIR 21 to cover contractor employees.\nE.g., Evans v. Miami Valley Hospital, ARB No. 07–118\netc., ALJ No. 2006–AIR–022, pp. 9–11 (June 30, 2009);\nPeck v. Safe Air Int’l, Inc., ARB No. 02–028, ALJ No.\n2001–AIR–3, p. 13 (Jan. 30, 2004).20 And DOL’s regula-\ntions adopting this interpretation of §42121 date back to\nApril 1, 2002, before §1514A was enacted. 67 Fed. Reg.\n15454, 15457–15458 (2002). The Senate Report for AIR 21\nsupports this reading, explaining that the Act “provide[s]\nemployees of airlines, and employees of airline contractors\nand subcontractors, with statutory whistleblower protec-\ntion.” S. Rep. No. 105–278, p. 22 (1998).21\n   The Court of Appeals recognized that Congress modeled\n§1514A on §42121, and that §42121 has been understood\nto protect contractor employees. 670 F. 3d, at 73–74. It\nnonetheless declined to interpret §1514A the same way,\nbecause, in its view, “important differences” separate the\ntwo provisions. First, unlike §1514A, §42121 contains a\n\n——————\n  19 For other provisions borrowing from AIR 21, see 49 U. S. C. §20109,\ngoverning rail carriers, which incorporates AIR 21’s enforcement\nprocedures, and §31105, governing motor carriers, which incorporates\nAIR 21’s proof burdens.\n   20 The ARB has also interpreted similarly worded whistleblower pro-\n\ntection provisions in the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, 49\nU. S. C. §60129(a), and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 42\nU. S. C. §5851(a), as protecting employees of contractors.

S. C. §42121(e). Second, unlike §1514A, §42121 does\nnot include “officers” or “employees” among governed\nactors. 670 F. 3d, at 74. These distinctions, the Court of\nAppeals reasoned, render §1514A less amenable to an\ninclusive construction of the protected class. Ibid.22\n  We do not find these textual differences overwhelming.\nTrue, Congress strayed from §42121’s pattern in failing to\ndefine “contractor” for purposes of §1514A, and in adding\n“officers” and “employees” to §1514A’s list of governed\nactors. And we agree that §1514A covers a far wider\nrange than §42121 does. But in our view, neither differ-\nence warrants the determination that §1514A omits em-\nployees of contractors while §42121 includes them. The\nprovisions’ parallel text and purposes counsel in favor of\ninterpreting the two provisions consistently. And we have\nalready canvassed the many reasons why §1514A is most\nsensibly read to protect employees of contractors. See\nsupra, at 9–22.\n                       *     *     *\n  For the reasons stated, we hold that 18 U. S.

ZANG,\n        PETITIONERS v.

S. C.\n§1514A protects employees of private contractors from\nretaliation when they report covered forms of fraud. As\nthe Court carefully demonstrates, that conclusion logically\nflows from §1514A’s text and broader context. I therefore\njoin the Court’s opinion in principal part.\n   I do not endorse, however, the Court’s occasional excur-\nsions beyond the interpretative terra firma of text and\ncontext, into the swamps of legislative history. Reliance\non legislative history rests upon several frail premises.\nFirst, and most important: That the statute means what\nCongress intended. It does not. Because we are a govern-\nment of laws, not of men, and are governed by what\nCongress enacted rather than by what it intended, the sole\nobject of the interpretative enterprise is to determine what\na law says. Second: That there was a congressional “in-\ntent” apart from that reflected in the enacted text. On\nmost issues of detail that come before this Court, I am\nconfident that the majority of Senators and Representa-\ntives had no views whatever on how the issues should be\nresolved—indeed, were unaware of the issues entirely.\nThird: That the views expressed in a committee report or a\n2                       LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nfloor statement represent those of all the Members of that\nHouse. Many of them almost certainly did not read the\nreport or hear the statement, much less agree with it—not\nto mention the Members of the other House and the Presi-\ndent who signed the bill.\n   Since congressional “intent” apart from enacted text is\nfiction to begin with, courts understandably allow them-\nselves a good deal of poetic license in defining it. Today’s\nopinion is no exception. It cites parts of the legislative\nrecord that are consistent with its holding that §1514A\ncovers employees of private contractors and subcontrac-\ntors, but it ignores other parts that unequivocally cut in\nthe opposite direction. For example, the following remark\nby the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s lead sponsor in the Senate:\n“[L]et me make very clear that [the Act] applies exclusively\nto public companies—that is, to companies registered\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is not\napplicable to pr[i]v[at]e companies,[*] who make up the\nvast majority of companies across the country.” 148 Cong.\nRec. 14440 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Sarbanes).\n   Two other minor points in the Court’s opinion I do not\nagree with. First, I do not rely on the fact that a separate\nanti-retaliation provision, 49 U. S. C. §42121(a), “has been\nread” by an administrative tribunal to cover contractor\nemployees. Ante, at 29. Section 1514A(b)(2), entitled\n“Procedure,” contains cross-references to the procedural\nrules set forth in §42121(b), but the substantive provisions\nof §1514A(a) are worded quite differently from the sub-\nstantive prohibition of §42121, which is contained in sub-\nsection (a)—thus making interpretation of the latter an\nunreliable guide to §1514A’s meaning. Second, I do not\nagree with the Court’s acceptance of the possible validity\n——————\n  * The Congressional Record reads “provide companies,” but context as\nwell as grammar makes clear that this is a scrivener’s error for “private\ncompanies.”\n                   Cite as: 571 U.

Although that “limiting prin-\ncipl[e],” ibid., may be appealing from a policy standpoint,\nit has no basis whatsoever in the statute’s text. So long as\nan employee works for one of the actors enumerated in\n§1514A(a) and reports a covered form of fraud in a manner\nidentified in §1514(a)(1)–(2), the employee is protected\nfrom retaliation.\n   For all the other reasons given by the Court, the stat-\nute’s text is clear, and I would reverse the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals and remand the case.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

S. C. §1514A(a). The Court recognizes that\nthe core purpose of the Act is to “safeguard investors in\npublic companies.” Ante, at 1. And the Court points out\nthat Congress entitled the whistleblower provision, “Pro-\ntection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies Who\nProvide Evidence of Fraud.” §806, 116 Stat. 802. Despite\nthese clear markers of intent, the Court does not construe\n§1514A to apply only to public company employees who\nblow the whistle on fraud relating to their public company\nemployers. The Court instead holds that the law encom-\npasses any household employee of the millions of people\nwho work for a public company and any employee of the\nhundreds of thousands of private businesses that contract\n\n——————\n  1 The majority uses the term “public company” as shorthand for 18\n\nU. S. C. §1514A’s reference to companies that either have “ ‘a class of\nsecurities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934,’ ” or that are “ ‘required to file reports under section 15(d).’ ” Ante,\nat 7–8. I do the same.\n2                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                     SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n to perform work for a public company.\n   The Court’s interpretation gives §1514A a stunning\nreach. As interpreted today, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act au-\nthorizes a babysitter to bring a federal case against his\nemployer—a parent who happens to work at the local\nWalmart (a public company)—if the parent stops employ-\ning the babysitter after he expresses concern that the\nparent’s teenage son may have participated in an Internet\npurchase fraud. And it opens the door to a cause of action\nagainst a small business that contracts to clean the local\nStarbucks (a public company) if an employee is demoted\nafter reporting that another nonpublic company client has\nmailed the cleaning company a fraudulent invoice.\n   Congress was of course free to create this kind of sweep-\ning regime that subjects a multitude of individuals and\nprivate businesses to litigation over fraud reports that\nhave no connection to, or impact on, the interests of pub-\nlic company shareholders. But because nothing in the text,\ncontext, or purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act suggests\nthat Congress actually wanted to do so, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                             I\n   Although the majority correctly starts its analysis with\nthe statutory text, it fails to recognize that §1514A is\ndeeply ambiguous. Three indicators of Congress’ intent\nclearly resolve this ambiguity in favor of a narrower inter-\npretation of §1514A: the statute’s headings, the statutory\ncontext, and the absurd results that follow from the major-\nity’s interpretation.\n                                  A\n    The majority begins its textual analysis by declaring\nthat the “ ‘relevant syntactic elements’ ” of §1514A are that\n“ ‘ “no . . . contractor . . . may discharge . . . an employee.” ’ ”\nAnte, at 9. After “ ‘boiling . . . down’ ” the text to this for-\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nmulation, the majority concludes that the “ordinary mean-\ning of ‘an employee’ ” is obviously “the contractor’s own\nemployee.” Ibid.\n   If that were what the statute said, the majority’s deci-\nsion would undoubtedly be correct. But §1514A(a) actu-\nally provides that “[n]o [public] company . . . or any officer,\nemployee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such\ncompany . . . may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten,\nharass, or in any other manner discriminate against an\nemployee.” The provision thus does not speak only (or\neven primarily) to “contractors.” It speaks to public com-\npanies, and then includes a list of five types of representa-\ntives that companies hire to carry out their business:\n“officer[s], employee[s], contractor[s], subcontractor[s],\n[and] agent[s].”\n   Read in full, then, the statute is ambiguous. The major-\nity is correct that it may be read broadly, to create a cause\nof action both for employees of public companies and for\nemployees of the enumerated public company representa-\ntives. But the statute can also be read more narrowly, to\nprohibit the public company and the listed representa-\ntives—all of whom act on the company’s behalf—from\nretaliating against just the public company’s employees.\n   The narrower reading of the text makes particular sense\nwhen one considers the other terms in the list of com-\npany representatives. The majority acknowledges that, as a\nmatter of “gramma[r],” the scope of protected employees\nmust be consistent with respect to all five types of com-\npany representatives listed in §1514A(a). Ante, at 15. Yet\nthe Government and petitioners readily concede that\n§1514A is meant to bar two of the enumerated repre-\nsentatives—“officer[s]” and “employee[s]”—from retaliating\nagainst other employees of the public company, as opposed\nto their own babysitters and housekeepers. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 16 (§1514A “impose[s]\npersonal liability on corporate officers and employees who\n4                       LAWSON v.

Fair enough. But Congress could\nmore clearly have dictated the majority’s construction of\nthe statute, too: It could have specified that public compa-\nnies and their officers, employees, contractors, subcontrac-\ntors, and agents may not retaliate against “their own\nemployees.” In any case, that Congress could have spoken\nwith greater specificity in both directions only underscores\nthat the words Congress actually chose are ambiguous. To\nresolve this ambiguity, we must rely on other markers of\nintent.\n                             B\n  We have long held that where the text is ambiguous, a\nstatute’s titles can offer “a useful aid in resolving [the]\n\n\n——————\n    2 In\n      reaching the opposite conclusion, the majority rejects the conces-\nsions by the Government and petitioners and gives no weight to the\nARB’s interpretation. If §1514A creates a cause of action for contractor\nemployees, the majority concludes, so too must it create a cause of\naction for “housekeepers” and “gardeners” against their individual\nemployers if they happen to work for a public company. Ante, at 15. In\nreaching this result, however, the majority only adds to the absurdities\nproduced by its holding. See infra, at 12–13.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Here, two headings strongly suggest that\nCongress intended §1514A to apply only to employees of\npublic companies. First, the title of §806—the section of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act that enacted §1514A—speaks\nclearly to the scope of employees protected by the provi-\nsion: “Protection for Employees of Publicly Traded Com-\npanies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.” 116 Stat. 802.\nSecond, the heading of §1514A(a) reinforces that the pro-\nvision provides “[w]histleblower protection for employees\nof publicly traded companies.”\n   The majority suggests that in covering “employees of\npublicly traded companies,” the headings may be impre-\ncise. Ante, at 16. Section 1514A(a) technically applies to\nthe employees of two types of companies: those “with a\nclass of securities registered under section 12 of the Secu-\nrities Exchange Act of 1934,” and those that are “required\nto file reports under section 15(d) of the” same Act. Both\ntypes of companies are “public” in that they are publicly\nowned. See ante, at 7–8. The difference is that shares of\nthe §12 companies are listed and traded on a national\nsecurities exchange; §15(d) companies, by contrast, ex-\nchange their securities directly with the public. The head-\nings may therefore be inexact in the sense that the phrase\n“publicly traded” is commonly associated with companies\nwhose securities are traded on national exchanges. Con-\ngress, however, had good reason to use the phrase to refer\nto §15(d) companies as well: Section 15(d) companies are\ntraded publicly, too. For instance, as the majority recog-\nnizes, ante, at 20, a mutual fund is one paradigmatic\nexample of a §15(d) company. And mutual funds, like\nother §15(d) companies, are both publicly owned and\nwidely traded; the trades just take place typically between\nthe fund and its investors directly.\n   In any case, even if referring to employees of §12 and\n§15(d) companies together as “employees of publicly traded\n6                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncompanies” may be slightly imprecise, the majority’s com-\npeting interpretation of §1514A would stretch the stat-\nute’s headings far past the point of recognition. As the\nmajority understands the law, Congress used the term\n“employees of publicly traded companies” as shorthand not\njust for (1) employees of §12 and §15(d) companies, but\nalso for (2) household employees of any individual who\nworks for a §12 or §15(d) company; (3) employees of any\nprivate company that contracts with a §12 or §15(d) com-\npany; (4) employees of any private company that, even if\nit does not contract with a public company, subcontracts\nwith a private company that does; and (5) employees of\nany agent of a §12 or §15(d) company. If Congress had\nwanted to enact such a far-reaching provision, it would\nhave called it something other than “[w]histleblower\nprotection for employees of publicly traded companies.”\n    Recognizing that Congress chose headings that are\ninconsistent with its interpretation, the majority notes\nthat the Court has “placed less weight on captions.” Ante,\nat 16. But where the captions favor one interpretation so\ndecisively, their significance should not be dismissed so\nquickly. As we have explained, headings are important\n“ ‘tools available for the resolution of a doubt’ about the\nmeaning of a statute.” Almendarez-Torres v. United\nStates, 523 U. S. 224, 234 (1998).\n                             C\n                             1\n  Statutory context confirms that Congress intended\n§1514A to apply only to employees of public companies.\nTo start, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a whole evinces a\nclear focus on public companies. Congress stated in the\nAct’s preamble that its objective was to “protect investors\nby improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate\ndisclosures made pursuant to the securities laws,” 116\nStat. 745, disclosures that public companies alone must\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nfile. The Act thus created enhanced disclosure obligations\nfor public companies, §401; added new conflict of interest\nrules for their executives, §402; increased the responsibili-\nties of their audit committees, §301; and created new rules\ngoverning insider trading by their executives and direc-\ntors, §306. The common denominator among all of these\nprovisions is their singular focus on the activities of public\ncompanies.\n   When Congress wanted to depart from the Act’s public\ncompany focus to regulate private firms and their employ-\nees, it spoke clearly. For example, §307 of the Act ordered\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue\nrules “setting forth minimum standards of professional\nconduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the\n[SEC],” including a rule requiring outside counsel to re-\nport violations of the securities laws to public company\nofficers and directors. 15 U. S. C. §7245. Similarly, Title I\nof the Act created the Public Company Accounting Over-\nsight Board (PCAOB) and vested it with the authority\nto register, regulate, investigate, and discipline privately\nheld outside accounting firms and their employees.\n§§7211–7215. And Title V required the SEC to adopt rules\ngoverning outside securities analysts when they make\npublic recommendations regarding securities. §78o–6.\n   Section 1514A, by contrast, does not unambiguously\ncover the employees of private businesses that contract\nwith public companies or the employees of individuals who\nwork for public companies. Far from it, for the reasons\nnoted above. Yet as the rest of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\ndemonstrates, if Congress had really wanted §1514A to\nimpose liability upon broad swaths of the private sector, it\nwould have said so more clearly.\n   Congress’ intent to adopt the narrower understanding of\n§1514A is also clear when the statute is compared to the\nwhistleblower provision that served as its model. That\nprovision, enacted as part of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation\n8                    LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nInvestment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, 49\nU. S. C. §42121, provides that “[n]o air carrier or contrac-\ntor or subcontractor of an air carrier” may retaliate\nagainst an employee who reports a potential airline safety\nviolation.\n  Section 42121 protects employees of contractors. But as\nthe majority acknowledges, “Congress strayed” from\n§42121 in significant ways when it wrote §1514A. Ante,\nat 29. First, §42121 specifically defines the term “con-\ntractor,” limiting the term to “a company that performs\nsafety-sensitive functions by contract for an air carrier.”\n§42121(e). That is in notable distinction to §1514A, which\ndoes not define the word “contractor” as a particular type\nof company, instead placing the term in a list alongside\nindividual “officer[s]” and “employee[s]” who act on a\ncompany’s behalf. Second, unlike §42121, §1514A sets off\nthe term “contractor” in a separate clause that is subsidi-\nary to the primary subject of the provision—the public\ncompany itself. Third, the title of §42121 is “[p]rotection of\nemployees providing air safety information,” a title that\ncomfortably encompasses the employees of contractors.\nNot so of §1514A’s headings, as explained above. In short,\n§42121 shows that Congress had an easy-to-follow model if\nit wanted to protect the employees of contractors, yet\nchose to depart from that model in several important\nways. We should not presume that choice to be accidental.\nSee Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S.\n723, 734 (1975).\n                             2\n   The majority relies on statutory context as well, but its\nexamples are unconvincing. It first argues that the types\nof conduct prohibited by the statute—“discharge, demo-\ntion, suspension, threats, harassment, [and] discrimina-\ntion in the terms and conditions of employment”—are\n“commonly actions an employer takes against its own\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

The problem is that §1514A does\nnot forbid retaliation by an “employer”; it forbids retalia-\ntion by a “[public] company . . . or any officer, employee,\ncontractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company.” For\nthe reasons already discussed, Congress could have rea-\nsonably included the five types of representatives not in\ntheir capacity as employers, but rather as representatives\nof the company who are barred from retaliating against a\npublic company’s employees on the company’s behalf.\n   The majority next suggests that contractors are rarely\n“positioned to take adverse actions against employees of\nthe public company with whom they contract.” Ante, at\n10. That misconceives the nature of modern work forces,\nwhich increasingly comprise a mix of contractors and\npersons laboring under more typical employment relation-\nships. For example, public companies often hire “inde-\npendent contractors,” of whom there are more than 10\nmillion,3 and contract workers,4 of whom there are more\nthan 11 million.5 And they employ outside lawyers, ac-\ncountants, and auditors as well.

Otherwise, the statute would have had a\ngaping hole—a public company could evade §1514A simply\nby hiring a contractor to engage in the very retaliatory\nacts that an officer or employee could not.6\n  The majority also too quickly dismisses the prominence\nof “outplacement” firms, or consultants that help compa-\nnies determine whom to fire. See ante, at 11. Companies\nspent $3.6 billion on these services in 2009 alone.7 Con-\n——————\n   6 The majority submits that the hole might not be so problematic\n\nbecause §1514A “surely” prohibits a “public company from directing\nsomeone else to engage in retaliatory conduct against the public com-\npany’s employees.” Ante, at 13. It surely does, but that is the point—\nthe whole reason §1514A(a) clearly does so is because it expressly\nforbids a public company to retaliate against its employees through\n“any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent.” The prohi-\nbition on retaliation through a contractor would be far less certain\n(hence the hole) if Congress had merely forbidden a public company to\nretaliate through its “officers and employees.” Moreover, while the\nmajority concedes that, under the narrower reading of §1514A, Con-\ngress’ inclusion of the term “contractor” imposes secondary liability in\nthe event a public company is judgment proof, ante, at 13, the majority\nfails to recognize that Congress’ use of the term also imposes primary\nliability against contractors who threaten public company employees\nwithout direction from the company. Thus, for example, FMR’s inter-\npretation of §1514A would prevent an outside accountant from threat-\nening or harassing a public company employee who discovers that the\naccountant is defrauding the public company and who seeks to blow the\nwhistle on that fraud.\n   7 Rogers, Do Firing Consultants Really Exist, Slate, Jan. 7, 2010,\n\nwww.slate.com / articles / news_and_politics / explainer/2010/01/getting_\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

See,\ne.g., Kalkunte v.

Ante, at 11, n. 9. The two\nwords are not legally synonymous, however. An outplacement firm and\npublic company might, for example, enter into a contract with a provi-\nsion expressly disclaiming an agency relationship. Moreover, Congress’\nuse of the term “contractor” would in all events have an independent\nand important effect: If Congress had not included the term, no one\ncould be held liable if a contractor were to threaten or harass a public\ncompany employee without the company’s direction. While the major-\nity may speculate that such occurrences are rare, ibid., it is hardly\nunthinkable. See n. 6, supra.\n12                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nenough for the statute’s remedial scheme to make sense.\nThe majority’s reference to the affirmative defense for\npublic company “employers” who lack “knowledge” that an\nemployee has participated in a proceeding relating to the\nfraud report, ante, at 12 (citing §1514(A)(a)(2)), fails for a\nsimilar reason. There is no rule that Congress may only\nprovide an affirmative defense if it is available to every\nconceivable defendant.\n                              D\n                              1\n   Finally, the majority’s reading runs afoul of the precept\nthat “interpretations of a statute which would produce\nabsurd results are to be avoided if alternative interpreta-\ntions consistent with the legislative purpose are avail-\nable.” Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U. S. 564,\n575 (1982). The majority’s interpretation transforms\n§1514A into a sweeping source of litigation that Congress\ncould not have intended. As construed by the majority,\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act regulates employment relation-\nships between individuals and their nannies, housekeep-\ners, and caretakers, subjecting individual employers to\nlitigation if their employees claim to have been harassed\nfor providing information regarding any of a host of of-\nfenses. If, for example, a nanny is discharged after ex-\npressing a concern to his employer that the employer’s\nteenage son may be participating in some Internet fraud,\nthe nanny can bring a §1514A suit. The employer may\nprevail, of course, if the nanny cannot prove he was fired\n“because of” the fraud report. §1514A. But there is little\nreason to think Congress intended to sweep such disputes\ninto federal court.\n   Nor is it plausible that Congress intended the Act to\nimpose costly litigation burdens on any private business\nthat happens to have an ongoing contract with a public\ncompany. As the majority acknowledges, the purpose of\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Yet the majority might well embroil\nfederal agencies and courts in the resolution of mundane\nlabor disputes that have nothing to do with such concerns.\nFor instance, a construction worker could file a §1514A\nsuit against her employer (that has a long-term contract\nwith a public company) if the worker is demoted after\nreporting that another client has mailed the company a\nfalse invoice.9\n   The majority’s interpretation also produces truly odd\ndistinctions. Under the rule it announces, a babysitter\ncan bring a §1514A retaliation suit against his employer\nif his employer is a checkout clerk for the local PetSmart\n(a public company), but not if she is a checkout clerk for the\nlocal Petco (a private company). Likewise, the day laborer\nwho works for a construction business can avail himself of\n§1514A if her company has been hired to help remodel the\nlocal Dick’s Sporting Goods store (a public company), but\nnot if it is remodeling a nearby Sports Authority (a private\ncompany).\n   In light of the reasonable alternative reading of §1514A,\nthere is no reason to accept these absurd results. The\nmajority begs to differ, arguing that “[t]here is scant evi-\ndence” that lawsuits have been brought by the multitude\nof newly covered employees “ ‘who have no exposure to\ninvestor-related activities and thus could not possibly\n\n\n——————\n  9 Recognizing that the majority’s reading would lead to a “notably\n\nexpansive scope untethered to the purpose of the statute,” the District\nCourt in this case sought to impose an extratextual limiting principle\nunder which an employee who reports fraud is entitled to protection\nonly if her report “relat[es] to fraud against shareholders.” 724\nF. Supp. 2d 141, 160 (Mass. 2010). The District Court acknowledged,\nhowever, that “the language of the statute itself does not plainly\nprovide such a limiting principle,” id., at 158, and the majority does not\nattempt to revive that limitation here.\n14                  LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nassist in detecting investor fraud.’ ” Ante, at 22. Until\ntoday, however, no court has deemed §1514A applicable to\nhousehold employees of individuals who work for public\ncompanies; even the Department of Labor’s ARB rejected\nthat view. Spinner, ALJ No. 2010–SOX–029, at 8. And as\nthe District Court noted, prior to the ARB’s 2012 decision\nin Spinner, the ARB “ha[d] yet to provide . . . definitive\nclarification” on the question whether §1514A extends to\nthe employees of a public company’s private contractors.\n724 F. Supp. 2d 141, 155 (Mass. 2010). So the fact that\nindividuals and private businesses have yet to suffer\nburdensome litigation offers little assurance that the ma-\njority’s capacious reading of §1514A will produce no un-\ntoward effects.\n  Finally, it must be noted that §1514A protects the re-\nporting of a variety of frauds—not only securities fraud,\nbut also mail, wire, and bank fraud. By interpreting a\nstatute that already protects an expansive class of conduct\nalso to cover a large class of employees, today’s opinion\nthreatens to subject private companies to a costly new\nfront of employment litigation. Congress almost certainly\ndid not intend the statute to have that reach.\n                             2\n   The majority argues that the broader reading of §1514A\nis necessary because a small number of the millions of\nindividuals and private companies affected by its ruling\nhave a special role to play in preventing public company\nfraud. If §1514A does not bar retaliation against employ-\nees of contractors, the majority cautions, then law firms\nand accounting firms will be free to retaliate against their\nemployees when those employees report fraud on the part\nof their public company clients.\n   It is undisputed that Congress was aware of the role\nthat outside accountants and lawyers played in the Enron\ndebacle and the importance of encouraging them to play\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

But it hardly\nfollows that Congress must have meant to apply §1514A to\nevery employee of every public company contractor, sub-\ncontractor, officer, and employee as a result. It is far more\nlikely that Congress saw the unique ethical duties and\nprofessional concerns implicated by outside lawyers and\naccountants as reason to vest regulatory authority in the\nhands of experts with the power to sanction wrongdoers.\n   Specifically, rather than imposing §1514A’s generic\napproach on outside accounting firms, Congress estab-\nlished the PCAOB, which regulates “every detail” of an\naccounting firm’s practice, including “supervision of au-\ndit work,” “internal inspection procedures,” “professional\nethics rules,” and “ ‘such other requirements as the Board\nmay prescribe.’ ” Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 3–4). Importantly, the PCAOB is empowered to\nlevy “severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings, up to\nand including the permanent revocation of a firm’s regis-\ntration . . . and money penalties of $15 million.” Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 4) (citing 15 U. S. C. §7215(c)(4)). Such sanc-\ntions could well provide a more powerful incentive to\nprevent an accounting firm from retaliating against its\nemployees than §1514A.\n   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act confers similar regulatory\nauthority upon the SEC with respect to attorneys. The\nAct requires the SEC to establish rules of professional\nconduct for attorneys, §307 (codified at 15 U. S. C. §7245),\nand confers broad power on the SEC to punish attorneys\nfor “improper professional conduct,” which would include,\nfor example, a law firm partner’s decision to retaliate\nagainst an associate who reports fraud. §602 (codified at\n15 U. S. C. §78d–3). Indeed, the Act grants the SEC the\npower to censure culpable attorneys and to deny “perma-\nnently” to any such attorney the “privilege of appearing of\npracticing before” the SEC “in any way.” §602.\n16                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Congress thus evidently made the judgment that deci-\nsions concerning how best to punish law firms and ac-\ncounting firms ought to be handled not by the Department\nof Labor, but by the SEC and the PCAOB. Such judgment\nshould not be disturbed under usual circumstances, much\nless at the cost to congressional intent produced by today’s\nruling. The majority does offer cogent policy arguments\nfor why Congress might have been wiser to include certain\ntypes of contractors within §1514A, noting for example\nthat a law firm or accounting firm might be able to retali-\nate against its employees for making reports required\nunder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Ante, at 19. But as the\nmajority recognizes, Congress has since remedied that\nprecise concern, enacting a comprehensive whistleblower\nincentive and protection program that unequivocally\n“prohibit[s] any employer”—public or private—“from re-\ntaliating against ‘a whistleblower’ for providing infor-\nmation to the SEC, participating in an SEC proceeding, or\nmaking disclosures required or protected under Sarbanes-\nOxley and certain other securities laws.” Ante, at 26\n(citing 15 U.

S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).11\nUnder United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226–\n227 (2001), an agency may claim Chevron deference “when\nit appears [1] that Congress delegated authority to the\nagency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,\nand [2] that the agency interpretation claiming deference\nwas promulgated in the exercise of that authority.” Nei-\nther requirement is met here.\n   First, the agency interpretation for which petitioners\nclaim deference is the position announced by the ARB, the\nboard to which the Secretary of Labor has delegated au-\nthority “in review or on appeal” in connection with §1514A\nproceedings. 75 Fed. Reg. 3924 (2010). According to\npetitioners, the ARB’s rulings are entitled to deference\nbecause the “Secretary is responsible for enforcing Section\n1514A both through investigation and through formal\nadjudication.” Brief for Petitioners 61. That is right as far\nas it goes, but even if the Secretary has the power to in\n\n——————\n§80b–11. The Act also authorizes fines and imprisonment of up to five\nyears for violations of SEC rules. The SEC thus has broad discretion to\npunish retaliatory actions taken by mutual fund advisers against their\nemployees. And to the extent these provisions may have been insuffi-\ncient to protect mutual fund adviser employees, §78u–6’s extensive\nwhistleblower incentive and protection program now unambiguously\ncovers such employees.\n   11 Although it claims not to reach the issue, ante, at 9, n. 6, the major-\n\nity implicitly declines to defer to a portion of the ARB’s ruling as well,\nrejecting the ARB’s ruling that §1514A does not apply to the household\nemployees of public company officers and employees, ante, at 15, and\nn. 11.\n18                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nvestigate and adjudicate §1514A claims, Congress did not\ndelegate authority to the Secretary to “make rules carry-\ning the force of law,” Mead, 533 U. S., at 226–227. Con-\ngress instead delegated that power to the SEC: Section\n3(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, codified at 15 U. S. C.\n§7202(a), provides that the SEC “shall promulgate such\nrules and regulations, as may be necessary or appropriate\nin the public interest or for the protection of investors, and\nin furtherance of this Act.” So if any agency has the au-\nthority to resolve ambiguities in §1514A with the force\nof law, it is the SEC, not the Department of Labor.\nSee Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review\nComm’n, 499 U. S. 144, 154 (1991). The SEC, however, has\nnot issued a regulation applying §1514A whistleblower\nprotection to employees of public company contractors.\nAnd while the majority notes that the SEC may share the\n(incorrect) view that the Department of Labor has inter-\npretive authority regarding §1514A, ante, at 9, n. 6, the\nmajority cites nothing to suggest that one agency may\ntransfer authority unambiguously delegated to it by Con-\ngress to a different agency simply by signing onto an\namicus brief.\n   That Congress did not intend for the Secretary to re-\nsolve ambiguities in the law is confirmed by §1514A’s\nmechanism for judicial review. The statute does not merely\npermit courts to review the Secretary’s final adjudicatory\nrulings under the Administrative Procedure Act’s defer-\nential standard. It instead allows a claimant to bring an\naction in a federal district court, and allows district courts\nto adjudicate such actions de novo, in any case where the\nSecretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days.\nThat is a conspicuously short amount of time in light of\nthe three-tiered process of agency review of §1514A\nclaims. See ante, at 5–6. As a result, even if Congress had\nnot delegated to the SEC the authority to resolve ambigui-\nties in §1514A, the muscular scheme of judicial review\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          19\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsuggests that Congress would have wanted federal courts,\nand not the Secretary of Labor, to have that power. See\nMead, 533 U. S., at 232 (declining to defer to Customs\nService classifications where, among other things, the\nstatute authorized “independent review of Customs classi-\nfications by the [Court of International Trade]”).\n   As to the second Mead requirement, even if Congress\nhad delegated authority to the Secretary to make “rules\ncarrying the force of law,” the “agency interpretation\nclaiming deference” in this case was not “promulgated in\nthe exercise of that authority.” Id., at 226–227. That is\nbecause the Secretary has explicitly vested any policymak-\ning authority he may have with respect to §1514A in the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\ninstead of the ARB. See 67 Fed. Reg. 65008 (2002). In\nfact, the Secretary has expressly withdrawn from the ARB\nany power to deviate from the rules OSHA issues on the\nDepartment of Labor’s behalf. 75 Fed. Reg. 3925 (“The\n[ARB] shall not have jurisdiction to pass on the validity of\nany portion of the Code of Federal Regulations that has\nbeen duly promulgated by the Department of Labor and\nshall observe the provisions thereof, where pertinent, in\nits decisions”).\n   OSHA has promulgated regulations supporting the\nmajority’s reading of §1514A. See 29 CFR §1980.101(f )–(g)\n(2013). The Secretary, however, has expressly disclaimed\nany claim of deference to them. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 33, n. 8. As a result, the ARB’s\nunderstanding of §1514A’s coverage in Spinner was not an\n“exercise of [the Secretary’s] authority” to make rules\ncarrying the force of law, Mead, 533 U. S., at 226–227, but\nrather the ARB’s necessary compliance with a regulation\nthat no one claims is deserving of deference in the first\nplace. See Spinner, ALJ No. 2010–SOX–029, at 10 (recog-\nnizing that “the ARB is bound by the [Department of\nLabor] regulations”).\n20                  LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  In the absence of Chevron deference, the ARB’s decision\nin Spinner may claim only “respect according to its per-\nsuasiveness” under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S.\n134 (1944). See Mead, 533 U. S., at 221. But the ARB’s\ndecision is unpersuasive, for the many reasons already\ndiscussed.\n                        *    *     *\n   The Court’s interpretation of §1514A undeniably serves\na laudatory purpose. By covering employees of every of-\nficer, employee, and contractor of every public company,\nthe majority’s interpretation extends §1514A’s protections\nto the outside lawyers and accountants who could have\nhelped prevent the Enron fraud.\n   But that is not the statute Congress wrote. Congress\nenvisioned a system in which public company employees\nwould be covered by §1514A, and in which outside law-\nyers, investment advisers, and accountants would be\nregulated by the SEC and PCAOB. Congress did not\nenvision a system in which employees of other private\nbusinesses—such as cleaning and construction company\nworkers who have little interaction with investor-related\nactivities and who are thus ill suited to assist in detecting\nfraud against shareholders—would fall within §1514A.\nNor, needless to say, did it envision §1514A applying to\nthe household employees of millions of individuals who\nhappen to work for public companies—housekeepers,\ngardeners, and babysitters who are also poorly positioned\nto prevent fraud against public company investors. And to\nthe extent §1514A may have been underinclusive as first\ndrafted, Congress has shown itself capable of filling in any\ngaps. See, e.g., Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-\nsumer Protection Act, §§922, 929A, 124 Stat. 1848, 1852\n(extending §1514A to credit rating agencies and public\ncompany subsidiaries); §922, id., at 1841–1848 (codifying\nadditional whistleblower incentive and protection program\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   21\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nat 15 U. S. C. §78u–6).\n  The Court’s decision upsets the balance struck by Con-\ngress. Fortunately, just as Congress has added further\nprotections to the system it originally designed when\nnecessary, so too may Congress now respond to limit the\nfar-reaching implications of the Court’s interpretation.12\nBut because that interpretation relies on a debatable view\nof §1514A’s text, is inconsistent with the statute’s titles\nand its context, and leads to absurd results that Congress\ndid not intend, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  12 Congress could, for example, limit §1514A to contractor employees\n\nin only those professions that can assist in detecting fraud on public\ncompany shareholders, or it could restrict the fraud reports that trigger\nwhistleblower protection to those that implicate the interests of public\ncompany investors, see n. 9, supra.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2655498/", "sha1": "08d2207adecbeaf9f11ac6a38bdff4a25dee9d6e", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-024", "time_retrieved": "2014-03-04T14:55:21.957379"}
