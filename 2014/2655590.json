UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12–895.      Argued November 12, 2013—Decided March 5, 2014\nPetitioner Justus Rosemond took part in a drug deal in which either he\n  or one of his confederates fired a gun. Because the shooter’s identity\n  was disputed, the Government charged Rosemond with violating 18\n  U. S. C. §924(c) by using or carrying a gun in connection with a drug\n  trafficking crime, or, in the alternative, aiding and abetting that of-\n  fense under 18 U. S. C. §2. The trial judge instructed the jury that\n  Rosemond was guilty of aiding and abetting the §924(c) offense if he\n  (1) “knew his cohort used a firearm in the drug trafficking crime” and\n  (2) “knowingly and actively participated in the drug trafficking\n  crime.” This deviated from Rosemond’s proposed instruction that the\n  jury must find that he acted intentionally “to facilitate or encourage”\n  the firearm’s use, as opposed to merely the predicate drug offense.\n  Rosemond was convicted, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed, rejecting\n  his argument that the District Court’s aiding and abetting instruc-\n  tions were erroneous.\nHeld:\n    1. The Government establishes that a defendant aided and abetted\n a §924(c) violation by proving that the defendant actively participat-\n ed in the underlying drug trafficking or violent crime with advance\n knowledge that a confederate would use or carry a gun during the\n crime’s commission. Pp. 5–16.\n       (a) The federal aiding and abetting statute, which derives from\n common-law standards for accomplice liability, has two components.\n A person is liable under §2 only if he (1) takes an affirmative act in\n furtherance of the underlying offense (2) with the intent to facilitate\n that offense’s commission. Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) The first question is whether Rosemond’s conduct was suffi-\n cient to satisfy the affirmative act requirement of aiding and abet-\n2                    ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ting. Section 924(c) has two elements: a drug deal or violent crime,\n    and using or carrying a firearm in connection with that crime. The\n    instructions permitted the jury to convict Rosemond of aiding and\n    abetting even if he facilitated only the drug element, and not the gun\n    element, of the §924(c) offense. Those instructions were correct. The\n    common law imposed aiding and abetting liability on a person who\n    facilitated any element of a criminal offense, even if he did not facili-\n    tate all elements. That principle continues to govern §2. See, e.g.,\n    United States v. Johnson, 319 U. S. 503, 515. Pp. 6–11.\n         (c) In addition to conduct extending to some part of the crime,\n    aiding and abetting requires intent extending to the whole crime.\n    The defendant must not just associate himself with the venture, but\n    also participate in it as something that he wishes to bring about and\n    seek by his actions to make it succeed. Nye & Nissen v. United\n    States, 336 U. S. 613, 619. That requirement is satisfied when a per-\n    son actively participates in a criminal venture with full knowledge of\n    the circumstances constituting the charged offense. See Pereira v.\n    United States, 347 U. S. 1, 12. An active participant in a drug trans-\n    action has the intent needed to aid and abet a §924(c) violation when\n    he knows that one of his confederates will carry a gun. This must be\n    advance knowledge—meaning, knowledge at a time when the accom-\n    plice has a reasonable opportunity to walk away. Pp. 11–16.\n      2. The trial court’s jury instructions were erroneous because they\n    failed to require that Rosemond knew in advance that one of his co-\n    horts would be armed. In telling the jury to consider merely whether\n    Rosemond “knew his cohort used a firearm,” the court did not direct\n    the jury to determine when Rosemond obtained the requisite\n    knowledge—i.e., to decide whether Rosemond knew about the gun in\n    sufficient time to withdraw from the crime. The case is remanded to\n    permit the Tenth Circuit to address whether this objection was\n    properly preserved and whether any error was harmless.

We also conclude that the jury in-\nstructions given below were erroneous because they failed\nto require that the defendant knew in advance that one of\nhis cohorts would be armed.\n                           I\n  This case arises from a drug deal gone bad. Vashti\nPerez arranged to sell a pound of marijuana to Ricardo\nGonzales and Coby Painter. She drove to a local park to\nmake the exchange, accompanied by two confederates,\n——————\n * JUSTICE SCALIA joins all but footnotes 7 and 8 of this opinion.\n2                 ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nRonald Joseph and petitioner Justus Rosemond. One of\nthose men apparently took the front passenger seat and\nthe other sat in the back, but witnesses dispute who was\nwhere. At the designated meeting place, Gonzales climbed\ninto the car’s backseat while Painter waited outside. The\nbackseat passenger allowed Gonzales to inspect the mari-\njuana. But rather than handing over money, Gonzales\npunched that man in the face and fled with the drugs. As\nGonzales and Painter ran away, one of the male passengers—\nbut again, which one is contested—exited the car and\nfired several shots from a semiautomatic handgun. The\nshooter then re-entered the vehicle, and all three would-\nbe drug dealers gave chase after the buyers-turned-\nrobbers. But before the three could catch their quarry,\na police officer, responding to a dispatcher’s alert, pulled\ntheir car over. This federal prosecution of Rosemond\nfollowed.1\n   The Government charged Rosemond with, inter alia,\nviolating §924(c) by using a gun in connection with a drug\ntrafficking crime, or aiding and abetting that offense\nunder §2 of Title 18. Section 924(c) provides that “any\nperson who, during and in relation to any crime of violence\nor drug trafficking crime[,] . . . uses or carries a firearm,”\nshall receive a five-year mandatory-minimum sentence,\nwith seven- and ten-year minimums applicable, respec-\ntively, if the firearm is also brandished or discharged. 18\nU. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A). Section 2, for its part, is the federal\naiding and abetting statute: It provides that “[w]hoever\ncommits an offense against the United States or aids,\nabets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its com-\nmission is punishable as a principal.”\n   Consistent with the indictment, the Government prose-\n——————\n  1 The Government agreed not to bring charges against the other four\n\nparticipants in the narcotics deal in exchange for their giving truthful\ntestimony against Rosemond. See 2 Record 245, 272, 295–296, 318.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncuted the §924(c) charge on two alternative theories. The\nGovernment’s primary contention was that Rosemond\nhimself used the firearm during the aborted drug transac-\ntion. But recognizing that the identity of the shooter was\ndisputed, the Government also offered a back-up argu-\nment: Even if it was Joseph who fired the gun as the drug\ndeal fell apart, Rosemond aided and abetted the §924(c)\nviolation.\n   The District Judge accordingly instructed the jury on\naiding and abetting law. He first explained, in a way\nchallenged by neither party, the rudiments of §2. Under\nthat statute, the judge stated, “[a] person who aids or\nabets another to commit an offense is just as guilty of that\noffense as if he committed it himself.” App. 195. And in\norder to aid or abet, the defendant must “willfully and\nknowingly associate[ ] himself in some way with the crime,\nand . . . seek[ ] by some act to help make the crime suc-\nceed.” Id., at 196. The judge then turned to applying\nthose general principles to §924(c)—and there, he deviated\nfrom an instruction Rosemond had proposed. According to\nRosemond, a defendant could be found guilty of aiding or\nabetting a §924(c) violation only if he “intentionally took\nsome action to facilitate or encourage the use of the fire-\narm,” as opposed to the predicate drug offense. Id., at 14.\nBut the District Judge disagreed, instead telling the jury\nthat it could convict if “(1) the defendant knew his cohort\nused a firearm in the drug trafficking crime, and (2) the\ndefendant knowingly and actively participated in the drug\ntrafficking crime.” Id., at 196. In closing argument, the\nprosecutor contended that Rosemond easily satisfied that\nstandard, so that even if he had not “fired the gun, he’s\nstill guilty of the crime.” Id., at 158. After all, the prose-\ncutor stated, Rosemond “certainly knew [of] and actively\nparticipated in” the drug transaction. Ibid. “And with\nregards to the other element,” the prosecutor urged, “the\nfact is a person cannot be present and active at a drug deal\n4                 ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen shots are fired and not know their cohort is using a\ngun. You simply can’t do it.” Ibid.\n   The jury convicted Rosemond of violating §924(c) (as\nwell as all other offenses charged). The verdict form was\ngeneral: It did not reveal whether the jury found that\nRosemond himself had used the gun or instead had aided\nand abetted a confederate’s use during the marijuana deal.\nAs required by §924(c), the trial court imposed a consec-\nutive sentence of 120 months of imprisonment for the\nstatute’s violation.\n   The Tenth Circuit affirmed, rejecting Rosemond’s argu-\nment that the District Court’s aiding and abetting instruc-\ntions were erroneous.2 The Court of Appeals acknowledged\nthat some other Circuits agreed with Rosemond that\na defendant aids and abets a §924(c) offense only if he\nintentionally takes “some action to facilitate or encourage\nhis cohort’s use of the firearm.” 695 F. 3d 1151, 1155\n(2012).3 But the Tenth Circuit had already adopted a\ndifferent standard, which it thought consonant with the\nDistrict Court’s instructions. See, e.g., United States v.\nWiseman, 172 F. 3d 1196, 1217 (1999) (requiring that the\ndefendant “actively participated in the” underlying crime\nand “knew [his confederate] was carrying [a] firearm”).\nAnd the Court of Appeals held that Rosemond had pre-\nsented no sufficient reason for departing from that prece-\ndent. See 695 F. 3d, at 1156.\n   We granted certiorari, 569 U. S. ___ (2013), to resolve\n\n——————\n   2 The Court of Appeals stated that it had to address that argument\n\neven if the jury could have found that Rosemond himself fired the gun,\nbecause “a conviction based on a general verdict is subject to challenge\nif the jury was instructed on alternative theories of guilt and may have\nrelied on an invalid one.” 695 F. 3d 1151, 1154 (2012) (quoting\nHedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. 57, 58 (2008) (per curiam)).\n   3 See, e.g., United States v. Rolon-Ramos, 502 F. 3d 750, 758–759\n\n(CA8 2007); United States v. Medina-Roman, 376 F. 3d 1, 6 (CA1 2004);\nUnited States v. Bancalari, 110 F. 3d 1425, 1429–1430 (CA9 1997).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Circuit conflict over what it takes to aid and abet a\n§924(c) offense. Although we disagree with Rosemond’s\nprincipal arguments, we find that the trial court erred in\ninstructing the jury. We therefore vacate the judgment\nbelow.\n                              II\n  The federal aiding and abetting statute, 18 U. S. C. §2,\nstates that a person who furthers—more specifically, who\n“aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures”—\nthe commission of a federal offense “is punishable as a\nprincipal.” That provision derives from (though simplifies)\ncommon-law standards for accomplice liability. See, e.g.,\nStandefer v. United States, 447 U. S. 10, 14–19 (1980);\nUnited States v. Peoni, 100 F. 2d 401, 402 (CA2 1938)\n(L. Hand, J.) (“The substance of [§2’s] formula goes back\na long way”). And in so doing, §2 reflects a centuries-old\nview of culpability: that a person may be responsible for a\ncrime he has not personally carried out if he helps another\nto complete its commission. See J. Hawley & M. McGregor,\nCriminal Law 81 (1899).\n  We have previously held that under §2 “those who pro-\nvide knowing aid to persons committing federal crimes,\nwith the intent to facilitate the crime, are themselves\ncommitting a crime.” Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v.\nFirst Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 181\n(1994). Both parties here embrace that formulation, and\nagree as well that it has two components. See Brief for\nPetitioner 28; Brief for United States 14. As at common\nlaw, a person is liable under §2 for aiding and abetting a\ncrime if (and only if) he (1) takes an affirmative act in\nfurtherance of that offense, (2) with the intent of facili-\ntating the offense’s commission. See 2 W. LaFave, Sub-\nstantive Criminal Law §13.2, p. 337 (2003) (hereinafter\nLaFave) (an accomplice is liable as a principal when he gives\n“assistance or encouragement . . . with the intent thereby\n6              ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto promote or facilitate commission of the crime”); Hicks v.\nUnited States, 150 U. S. 442, 449 (1893) (an accomplice is\nliable when his acts of assistance are done “with the inten-\ntion of encouraging and abetting” the crime).\n   The questions that the parties dispute, and we here\naddress, concern how those two requirements—affirmative\nact and intent—apply in a prosecution for aiding and\nabetting a §924(c) offense. Those questions arise from the\ncompound nature of that provision. Recall that §924(c)\nforbids “us[ing] or carr[ying] a firearm” when engaged in a\n“crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.” See supra, at\n2. The prosecutor must show the use or carriage of a gun;\nso too he must prove the commission of a predicate (violent\nor drug trafficking) offense. See Smith v. United States,\n508 U. S. 223, 228 (1993). For purposes of ascertaining\naiding and abetting liability, we therefore must consider:\nWhen does a person act to further this double-barreled\ncrime? And when does he intend to facilitate its commis-\nsion? We address each issue in turn.\n                               A\n   Consider first Rosemond’s account of his conduct (di-\nvorced from any issues of intent). Rosemond actively par-\nticipated in a drug transaction, accompanying two others\nto a site where money was to be exchanged for a pound\nof marijuana. But as he tells it, he took no action\nwith respect to any firearm. He did not buy or borrow a\ngun to facilitate the narcotics deal; he did not carry a gun\nto the scene; he did not use a gun during the subsequent\nevents constituting this criminal misadventure. His acts thus\nadvanced one part (the drug part) of a two-part incident—\nor to speak a bit more technically, one element (the\ndrug element) of a two-element crime. Is that enough to\nsatisfy the conduct requirement of this aiding and abetting\ncharge, or must Rosemond, as he claims, have taken some\nact to assist the commission of the other (firearm) compo-\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnent of §924(c)?\n   The common law imposed aiding and abetting liability\non a person (possessing the requisite intent) who facili-\ntated any part—even though not every part—of a criminal\nventure. As a leading treatise, published around the time\nof §2’s enactment, put the point: Accomplice liability at-\ntached upon proof of “[a]ny participation in a general\nfelonious plan” carried out by confederates. 1 F. Wharton,\nCriminal Law §251, p. 322 (11th ed. 1912) (hereinafter\nWharton) (emphasis added). Or in the words of another\nstandard reference: If a person was “present abetting\nwhile any act necessary to constitute the offense [was]\nbeing performed through another,” he could be charged as\na principal—even “though [that act was] not the whole\nthing necessary.” 1 J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Crim-\ninal Law §649, p. 392 (7th ed. 1882) (emphasis added).\nAnd so “[w]here several acts constitute[d] together one\ncrime, if each [was] separately performed by a different\nindividual[,] . . . all [were] principals as to the whole.” Id.,\n§650, at 392.4 Indeed, as yet a third treatise underscored,\na person’s involvement in the crime could be not merely\npartial but minimal too: “The quantity [of assistance was]\nimmaterial,” so long as the accomplice did “something” to\naid the crime. R. Desty, A Compendium of American\nCriminal Law §37a, p. 106 (1882) (emphasis added). After\nall, the common law maintained, every little bit helps—\nand a contribution to some part of a crime aids the whole.\n\n——————\n  4 The Wharton treatise gave the following example of how multiple\n\nconfederates could perform different roles in carrying out a crime.\nAssume, Wharton hypothesized, that several persons “act in concert to\nsteal a man’s goods.” Wharton §251, at 322. The victim is “induced by\nfraud to trust one of them[,] in the presence of [the] others[,] with the\n[goods’] possession.” Ibid. Afterward, “another of the party entice[s]\nthe owner away so that he who has the goods may carry them off.” Id.,\nat 322–323. Wharton concludes: “[A]ll are guilty as principals.” Id.,\nat 323.\n8                  ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   That principle continues to govern aiding and abetting\nlaw under §2: As almost every court of appeals has held,\n“[a] defendant can be convicted as an aider and abettor\nwithout proof that he participated in each and every ele-\nment of the offense.” United States v. Sigalow, 812 F. 2d\n783, 785 (CA2 1987).5 In proscribing aiding and abetting,\nCongress used language that “comprehends all assistance\nrendered by words, acts, encouragement, support, or pres-\nence,” Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170, 178 (1993)—\neven if that aid relates to only one (or some) of a crime’s\nphases or elements. So, for example, in upholding convic-\ntions for abetting a tax evasion scheme, this Court found\n“irrelevant” the defendants’ “non-participation” in filing a\nfalse return; we thought they had amply facilitated the\nillegal scheme by helping a confederate conceal his assets.\nUnited States v. Johnson, 319 U. S. 503, 515, 518 (1943).\n“[A]ll who shared in [the overall crime’s] execution,” we\nexplained, “have equal responsibility before the law, what-\never may have been [their] different roles.” Id., at 515.\nAnd similarly, we approved a conviction for abetting mail\nfraud even though the defendant had played no part in\nmailing the fraudulent documents; it was enough to sat-\nisfy the law’s conduct requirement that he had in other\nways aided the deception. See Pereira v. United States,\n347 U. S. 1, 8–11 (1954). The division of labor between\ntwo (or more) confederates thus has no significance: A\nstrategy of “you take that element, I’ll take this one”\n——————\n   5 See also United States v.

Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U. S.\n275, 280 (1999); see supra, at 6. In enacting the statute,\n“Congress proscribed both the use of the firearm and the\ncommission of acts that constitute” a drug trafficking\ncrime. Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U. S, at 281. Rosemond\ntherefore could assist in §924(c)’s violation by facilitating\neither the drug transaction or the firearm use (or of course\nboth). In helping to bring about one part of the offense\n(whether trafficking drugs or using a gun), he necessarily\nhelped to complete the whole. And that ends the analysis\nas to his conduct. It is inconsequential, as courts applying\nboth the common law and §2 have held, that his acts did\nnot advance each element of the offense; all that matters\nis that they facilitated one component.\n   Rosemond argues, to the contrary, that the requisite act\nhere “must be directed at the use of the firearm,” because\nthat element is §924(c)’s most essential feature. Brief for\nPetitioner 33 (arguing that “it is the firearm crime” he was\nreally charged with aiding and abetting, “not the drug\ntrafficking crime”). But Rosemond can provide no author-\n——————\n   6 Consider a hypothetical similar to Johnson and Pereira (and a mod-\n\nern variant of the Wharton treatise’s, see n. 4, supra). Suppose that as\npart of a kidnapping scheme, one accomplice lures the victim into a car\nunder false pretenses; another drives the vehicle; a third allows the use\nof her house to hold the victim captive; and still a fourth keeps watch\noutside to divert potential witnesses. None would have personally\ncompleted, or even assisted with, all elements of the offense. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cervantes-Blanco, 504 F. 3d 576, 580 (CA5 2007)\n(listing elements). But (if they had the requisite intent) all would be\nliable under §2.\n10             ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nity for demanding that an affirmative act go toward an\nelement considered peculiarly significant; rather, as just\nnoted, courts have never thought relevant the importance\nof the aid rendered. See supra, at 7–8. And in any event,\nwe reject Rosemond’s premise that §924(c) is somehow\nmore about using guns than selling narcotics. It is true\nenough, as Rosemond says in support of that theory, that\n§924(c) “establishes a separate, freestanding offense that\nis ‘distinct from the underlying [drug trafficking crime].’ ”\nBrief for Petitioner 32 (quoting Simpson v. United States,\n435 U. S. 6, 10 (1978)). But it is just as true that §924(c)\nestablishes a freestanding offense distinct from any that\nmight apply just to using a gun—say, for discharging a\nfirearm in a public park. That is because §924(c) is, to\ncoin a term, a combination crime. It punishes the tem-\nporal and relational conjunction of two separate acts, on\nthe ground that together they pose an extreme risk of\nharm. See Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 132\n(1998) (noting that §924(c)’s “basic purpose” was “to com-\nbat the dangerous combination of drugs and guns”). And\nso, an act relating to drugs, just as much as an act relating\nto guns, facilitates a §924(c) violation.\n   Rosemond’s related argument that our approach would\nconflate two distinct offenses—allowing a conviction for\nabetting a §924(c) violation whenever the prosecution\nshows that the defendant abetted the underlying drug\ntrafficking crime—fares no better. See Brief for Petitioner\n38. That is because, as we will describe, an aiding and\nabetting conviction requires not just an act facilitating one\nor another element, but also a state of mind extending to\nthe entire crime. See infra, at 11. And under that rule, a\ndefendant may be convicted of abetting a §924(c) violation\nonly if his intent reaches beyond a simple drug sale, to an\narmed one. Aiding and abetting law’s intent component—\nto which we now turn—thus preserves the distinction\nbetween assisting the predicate drug trafficking crime and\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

As previously explained, a person aids and abets\na crime when (in addition to taking the requisite act) he\nintends to facilitate that offense’s commission. See supra,\nat 5–6. An intent to advance some different or lesser\noffense is not, or at least not usually, sufficient: Instead,\nthe intent must go to the specific and entire crime\ncharged—so here, to the full scope (predicate crime plus\ngun use) of §924(c). See, e.g., 2 LaFave §13.2(c); W. Clark\n& W. Marshall, Law of Crimes, §187, pp. 251–253 (2d ed.\n1905); ALI, Model Penal Code §2.06 Comment, p. 306\n(1985).7 And the canonical formulation of that needed\nstate of mind—later appropriated by this Court and oft-\nquoted in both parties’ briefs—is Judge Learned Hand’s:\nTo aid and abet a crime, a defendant must not just “in\nsome sort associate himself with the venture,” but also\n“participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring\nabout” and “seek by his action to make it succeed.” Nye &\nNissen v. United States, 336 U. S. 613, 619 (1949) (quoting\nPeoni, 100 F. 2d, at 402; see Brief for Petitioner 20, 28, 41;\nBrief for United States 14, 51.\n  We have previously found that intent requirement\nsatisfied when a person actively participates in a criminal\nventure with full knowledge of the circumstances consti-\n——————\n   7 Some authorities suggest an exception to the general rule when\n\nanother crime is the “natural and probable consequence” of the crime\nthe defendant intended to abet. See, e.g., 2 LaFave §13.3(b), at 356\n(citing cases); but see id., §13.3 (“Under the better view, one is not an\naccomplice to a crime merely because . . . that crime was a natural and\nprobable consequence of another offense as to which he is an accom-\nplice”). That question is not implicated here, because no one contends\nthat a §924(c) violation is a natural and probable consequence of simple\ndrug trafficking. We therefore express no view on the issue.\n12                ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntuting the charged offense. In Pereira, the mail fraud case\ndiscussed above, we found the requisite intent for aiding\nand abetting because the defendant took part in a fraud\n“know[ing]” that his confederate would take care of the\nmailing. 347 U. S., at 12; see supra, at 8. Likewise, in\nBozza v. United States, 330 U. S. 160, 165 (1947), we up-\nheld a conviction for aiding and abetting the evasion of\nliquor taxes because the defendant helped operate a clan-\ndestine distillery “know[ing]” the business was set up “to\nviolate Government revenue laws.” And several Courts of\nAppeals have similarly held—addressing a fact pattern\nmuch like this one—that the unarmed driver of a getaway\ncar had the requisite intent to aid and abet armed bank\nrobbery if he “knew” that his confederates would use\nweapons in carrying out the crime. See, e.g., United States\nv. Akiti, 701 F. 3d 883, 887 (CA8 2012); United States v.\nEaster, 66 F. 3d 1018, 1024 (CA9 1995). So for purposes of\naiding and abetting law, a person who actively partici-\npates in a criminal scheme knowing its extent and charac-\nter intends that scheme’s commission.8\n   The same principle holds here: An active participant in\na drug transaction has the intent needed to aid and abet a\n§924(c) violation when he knows that one of his confeder-\nates will carry a gun. In such a case, the accomplice has\ndecided to join in the criminal venture, and share in its\nbenefits, with full awareness of its scope—that the plan\ncalls not just for a drug sale, but for an armed one. In so\ndoing, he has chosen (like the abettors in Pereira and\nBozza or the driver in an armed robbery) to align himself\n——————\n   8 We did not deal in these cases, nor do we here, with defendants who\n\nincidentally facilitate a criminal venture rather than actively partici-\npate in it. A hypothetical case is the owner of a gun store who sells a\nfirearm to a criminal, knowing but not caring how the gun will be used.\nWe express no view about what sort of facts, if any, would suffice to\nshow that such a third party has the intent necessary to be convicted of\naiding and abetting.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the illegal scheme in its entirety—including its use of\na firearm. And he has determined (again like those other\nabettors) to do what he can to “make [that scheme] suc-\nceed.” Nye & Nissen, 336 U. S., at 619. He thus becomes\nresponsible, in the typical way of aiders and abettors, for\nthe conduct of others. He may not have brought the gun\nto the drug deal himself, but because he took part in that\ndeal knowing a confederate would do so, he intended the\ncommission of a §924(c) offense—i.e., an armed drug sale.\n  For all that to be true, though, the §924(c) defendant’s\nknowledge of a firearm must be advance knowledge—or\notherwise said, knowledge that enables him to make the\nrelevant legal (and indeed, moral) choice. When an ac-\ncomplice knows beforehand of a confederate’s design to\ncarry a gun, he can attempt to alter that plan or, if unsuc-\ncessful, withdraw from the enterprise; it is deciding in-\nstead to go ahead with his role in the venture that shows\nhis intent to aid an armed offense. But when an accom-\nplice knows nothing of a gun until it appears at the scene,\nhe may already have completed his acts of assistance; or\neven if not, he may at that late point have no realistic\nopportunity to quit the crime. And when that is so, the\ndefendant has not shown the requisite intent to assist a\ncrime involving a gun. As even the Government concedes,\nan unarmed accomplice cannot aid and abet a §924(c)\nviolation unless he has “foreknowledge that his confeder-\nate will commit the offense with a firearm.” Brief for\nUnited States 38; see also infra, at 15–17. For the reasons\njust given, we think that means knowledge at a time the\naccomplice can do something with it—most notably, opt to\nwalk away.9\n——————\n  9 Of course, if a defendant continues to participate in a crime after a\n\ngun was displayed or used by a confederate, the jury can permissibly\ninfer from his failure to object or withdraw that he had such knowledge.\nIn any criminal case, after all, the factfinder can draw inferences about\na defendant’s intent based on all the facts and circumstances of a\n14               ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Both parties here find something to dislike in our view\nof this issue. Rosemond argues that a participant in a\ndrug deal intends to assist a §924(c) violation only if he\naffirmatively desires one of his confederates to use a gun.\nSee Reply Brief 8–11. The jury, Rosemond concedes, could\ninfer that state of mind from the defendant’s advance\nknowledge that the plan included a firearm. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 5. But according to Rosemond, the instructions\nmust also permit the jury to draw the opposite conclusion—\nthat although the defendant participated in a drug\ndeal knowing a gun would be involved, he did not spe-\ncifically want its carriage or use. That higher standard,\nRosemond claims, is necessary to avoid subjecting persons\nof different culpability to the same punishment. Rose-\nmond offers as an example an unarmed driver assisting in\nthe heist of a store: If that person spent the drive “trying\nto persuade [his confederate] to leave [the] gun behind,”\nthen he should be convicted of abetting shoplifting, but not\narmed robbery. Reply Brief 9.\n   We think not. What matters for purposes of gauging\nintent, and so what jury instructions should convey, is\nthat the defendant has chosen, with full knowledge, to\nparticipate in the illegal scheme—not that, if all had been\nleft to him, he would have planned the identical crime.\nConsider a variant of Rosemond’s example: The driver of a\ngetaway car wants to help rob a convenience store (and\nargues passionately for that plan), but eventually accedes\nwhen his confederates decide instead to hold up a national\nbank. Whatever his original misgivings, he has the requi-\nsite intent to aid and abet bank robbery; after all, he put\naside those doubts and knowingly took part in that more\ndangerous crime. The same is true of an accomplice who\nknowingly joins in an armed drug transaction—regardless\nwhether he was formerly indifferent or even resistant to\n——————\ncrime’s commission.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nusing firearms. The law does not, nor should it, care\nwhether he participates with a happy heart or a sense of\nforeboding. Either way, he has the same culpability,\nbecause either way he has knowingly elected to aid in the\ncommission of a peculiarly risky form of offense.\n  A final, metaphorical way of making the point: By virtue\nof §924(c), using a firearm at a drug deal ups the ante. A\nwould-be accomplice might decide to play at those perilous\nstakes. Or he might grasp that the better course is to fold\nhis hand. What he should not expect is the capacity to\nhedge his bets, joining in a dangerous criminal scheme but\nevading its penalties by leaving use of the gun to someone\nelse. Aiding and abetting law prevents that outcome, so\nlong as the player knew the heightened stakes when he\ndecided to stay in the game.\n  The Government, for its part, thinks we take too strict a\nview of when a defendant charged with abetting a §924(c)\nviolation must acquire that knowledge. As noted above,\nthe Government recognizes that the accused accomplice\nmust have “foreknowledge” of a gun’s presence. Brief for\nUnited States 38; see supra, at 13. But the Government\nviews that standard as met whenever the accomplice,\nhaving learned of the firearm, continues any act of assist-\ning the drug transaction. See Brief for United States 48.\nAccording to the Government, the jury should convict such\na defendant even if he became aware of the gun only after\nhe realistically could have opted out of the crime.\n  But that approach, we think, would diminish too far the\nrequirement that a defendant in a §924(c) prosecution\nmust intend to further an armed drug deal. Assume,\nfor example, that an accomplice agrees to participate in a\ndrug sale on the express condition that no one brings a\ngun to the place of exchange. But just as the parties are\nmaking the trade, the accomplice notices that one of his\nconfederates has a (poorly) concealed firearm in his jacket.\nThe Government would convict the accomplice of aiding\n16                 ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand abetting a §924(c) offense if he assists in completing\nthe deal without incident, rather than running away or\notherwise aborting the sale. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40. But\nbehaving as the Government suggests might increase the\nrisk of gun violence—to the accomplice himself, other\nparticipants, or bystanders; and conversely, finishing the\nsale might be the best or only way to avoid that danger.\nIn such a circumstance, a jury is entitled to find that the\ndefendant intended only a drug sale—that he never in-\ntended to facilitate, and so does not bear responsibility for,\na drug deal carried out with a gun. A defendant manifests\nthat greater intent, and incurs the greater liability of\n§924(c), when he chooses to participate in a drug transac-\ntion knowing it will involve a firearm; but he makes no\nsuch choice when that knowledge comes too late for him to\nbe reasonably able to act upon it.10\n                             III\n     Under these principles, the District Court erred in\n——————\n   10 Contrary to the dissent’s view, see post, at 3–4, nothing in this\n\nholding changes the way the defenses of duress and necessity operate.\nNeither does our decision remotely deny that the “intent to undertake\nsome act is . . . perfectly consistent with the motive of avoiding adverse\nconsequences which would otherwise occur.” Post, at 5. Our holding is\ngrounded in the distinctive intent standard for aiding and abetting\nsomeone else’s act—in the words of Judge Hand, that a defendant must\nnot just “in some sort associate himself with the venture” (as seems to\nbe good enough for the dissent), but also “participate in it as in some-\nthing that he wishes to bring about” and “seek by his action to make it\nsucceed.” Nye & Nissen v. United States, 336 U. S. 613, 619 (1949)\n(quoting Peoni, 100 F. 2d, at 402). For the reasons just given, see\nsupra, at 13, 15–16, we think that intent standard cannot be satisfied if\na defendant charged with aiding and abetting a §924(c) offense learns\nof a gun only after he can realistically walk away—i.e., when he has no\nopportunity to decide whether “he wishes to bring about” (or make\nsucceed) an armed drug transaction, rather than a simple drug crime.\nAnd because a defendant’s prior knowledge is part of the intent re-\nquired to aid and abet a §924(c) offense, the burden to prove it resides\nwith the Government.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninstructing the jury, because it did not explain that Rose-\nmond needed advance knowledge of a firearm’s presence.\nRecall that the court stated that Rosemond was guilty of\naiding and abetting if “(1) [he] knew his cohort used a\nfirearm in the drug trafficking crime, and (2) [he] know-\ningly and actively participated in the drug trafficking\ncrime.” App. 196. We agree with that instruction’s second\nhalf: As we have explained, active participation in a drug\nsale is sufficient for §924(c) liability (even if the conduct\ndoes not extend to the firearm), so long as the defendant\nhad prior knowledge of the gun’s involvement. See supra,\nat 9, 11–13. The problem with the court’s instruction\ncame in its description of that knowledge requirement. In\ntelling the jury to consider merely whether Rosemond\n“knew his cohort used a firearm,” the court did not direct\nthe jury to determine when Rosemond obtained the requi-\nsite knowledge. So, for example, the jury could have\nconvicted even if Rosemond first learned of the gun when\nit was fired and he took no further action to advance the\ncrime. For that reason, the Government itself describes\nthe instruction’s first half as “potentially misleading,”\ncandidly explaining that “it would have been clearer to\nsay” that Rosemond had to know that his confederate\n“ ‘ would use’ [a firearm] or something . . . that makes\nabsolutely clear that you [need] foreknowledge.” Tr. of\nOral Arg. 48–49. We agree with that view, and then some:\nThe court’s statement failed to convey that Rosemond had\nto have advance knowledge, of the kind we have described,\nthat a confederate would be armed. See supra, at 13,\n15–16.\n    The Government contends that this problematic instruc-\ntion looks more accurate when viewed in context. In\nparticular, the Government points to the District Court’s\nprefatory “umbrella instruction” that to aid or abet a\ncrime, a defendant must “willfully and knowingly seek[ ]\nby some act to help make the crime succeed.” App. 196;\n18             ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for United States 49. That statement, the Govern-\nment rightly notes, “mirrors” Judge Hand’s classic formu-\nlation. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33; see supra, at 11. But the\nstatement is also pitched at a high level of generality.\nImmediately afterward, the District Court provided the\njury with the two-pronged test noted above—thus indicat-\ning how the broad principle should apply to the specific\ncharge of abetting a §924(c) offense. We therefore do not\nsee how the “umbrella” statement could have cured the\ncourt’s error. Indeed, a different contextual feature of the\ncase would only have amplified that mistake. As earlier\ndescribed, the prosecutor asserted in closing argument\nthat the court’s test was easily satisfied because “a person\ncannot be present and active at a drug deal when shots are\nfired and not know their cohort is using a gun.” App. 158;\nsee supra, at 3–4. The prosecutor thus invited the jury to\nconvict Rosemond even if he first learned of the gun as\nit was discharged, and no matter what he did afterward.\nOnce again, then, the message to the jury was that it need\nnot find advance knowledge—exactly what we (and for\nthat matter the Government) have said is required.\n   We send this case back to the Tenth Circuit to consider\nthe appropriate consequence, if any, of the District Court’s\nerror. The Government makes two arguments relevant to\nthat inquiry. First, it contends that Rosemond failed to\nobject specifically to the part of the trial court’s instruc-\ntions we have found wanting; thus, the Government as-\nserts, a plain-error standard should apply to his claim.\nSee Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b); Johnson v. United States,\n520 U. S. 461, 465–467 (1997). Second, the Government\nargues that any error in the court’s aiding and abetting\ninstruction was harmless, because the jury must have\nfound (based on another part of its verdict, not discussed\nhere) that Rosemond himself fired the gun. Those claims\nwere not raised or addressed below, and we see no special\nreason to decide them in the first instance. See Travelers\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Specifically, I\nreject the Court’s conclusion that a conviction for aiding\nand abetting a violation of 18 U. S. C. §924(c) demands\nproof that the alleged aider and abettor had what the\nCourt terms “a realistic opportunity” to refrain from en­\ngaging in the conduct at issue.1 Ante, at 13. This rule\nrepresents an important and, as far as I am aware, un­\nprecedented alteration of the law of aiding and abetting\nand of the law of intentionality generally.\n   To explain my disagreement with the Court’s analysis, I\nbegin with our case law on the mens rea required to estab­\nlish aiding and abetting. There is some tension in our\n——————\n   1 I am also concerned that the Court’s use, without clarification, of the\n\nphrase “advance knowledge” will lead readers astray. E.g., ante, at 1.\nViewed by itself, the phrase most naturally means knowledge acquired\nin advance of the commission of the drug trafficking offense, but this\nis not what the Court means. Rather, “advance knowledge,” as used by\nthe Court, may include knowledge acquired while the drug trafficking\noffense is in progress. Specifically, a defendant has such knowledge,\nthe Court says, if he or she first learns of the gun while the drug offense\nis in progress and at that time “realistically could have opted out of the\ncrime.” Ante, at 15.\n2              ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ncases on this point. Specifically, some of our cases suggest\nthat an aider and abettor must act purposefully or with\nintent. Prominent among these cases is Nye & Nissen v.\nUnited States, 336 U. S. 613 (1949), which the Court\nquotes. See ante, at 16, n. 10. In that case, the Court,\nquoting Judge Learned Hand’s formulation in United\nStates v. Peoni, 100 F. 2d 401 (CA2 1938), said that an\naider and abettor must “ ‘participate in [the crime] as in\nsomething that he wishes to bring about, [and] seek by his\naction to make it succeed.’ ” 336 U. S., at 619.\n   On the other hand, there are cases to which the Court\nalso refers, ante, at 12, that appear to hold that the requi­\nsite mens rea is simply knowledge. See Pereira v. United\nStates, 347 U. S. 1, 12 (1954); Bozza v. United States, 330\nU. S. 160, 164–165 (1947). The Court refers interchange­\nably to both of these tests and thus leaves our case law in\nthe same, somewhat conflicted state that previously ex-\nisted. But because the difference between acting purpose­\nfully (when that concept is properly understood) and acting\nknowingly is slight, this is not a matter of great concern.\n   Beginning on page 13, however, the Court veers off in a\nnew and, to my mind, most unfortunate direction. The\nCourt imagines the following situation:\n     “[A]n accomplice agrees to participate in a drug sale\n     on the express condition that no one brings a gun to\n     the place of exchange. But just as the parties are\n     making the trade, the accomplice notices that one of\n     his confederates has a (poorly) concealed firearm in\n     his jacket.” Ante, at 15.\nIf the accomplice, despite spotting the gun, continues to\nassist in the completion of the drug sale, has the accom­\nplice aided and abetted the commission of a violation of\n§924(c)?\n   The Court’s answer is “it depends.” Walking away, the\nCourt observes, “might increase the risk of gun violence—\nto the accomplice himself, other participants, or bystand­\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ners; and conversely, finishing the sale might be the best or\nonly way to avoid the danger.” Ante, at 16. Moreover—\nand this is where the seriously misguided step occurs—the\nCourt says that if the risk of walking away exceeds (by\nsome unspecified degree) the risk created by completing\nthe sale and if the alleged aider and abettor chooses to\ncontinue for that reason, the alleged aider and abettor\nlacks the mens rea required for conviction. See ante, at 16,\nn. 10.\n   What the Court has done is to convert what has up to\nnow been an affirmative defense into a part of the re­\nquired mens rea, and this step has very important concep­\ntual and practical consequences. It fundamentally alters\nthe prior understanding of mental states that form the\nfoundation of substantive criminal law, and it places a\nstrange and difficult burden on the prosecution.\n   That the Court has taken a radical step can be seen by\ncomparing what the Court now holds with the traditional\ndefense of necessity. That defense excuses a violation of\nlaw if “the harm which will result from compliance with\nthe law is greater than that which will result from viola­\ntion of it.” 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §10.1,\np. 116 (2003) (hereinafter LaFave).2 This is almost exactly\nthe balance-of-risks calculus adopted by the Court, but\nunder the traditional approach necessity is an affirmative\ndefense. See, e.g., United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394,\n416 (1980). Necessity and the closely related defense of\nduress are affirmative defenses because they almost invar­\n——————\n  2 Traditionally, the defense of necessity was employed when natural\nforces created the situation justifying non-compliance; when the situa­\ntion was the product of human action, duress was the appropriate\ndefense. 2 LaFave §10.1(a), at 116. But “[m]odern cases have tended to\nblur the distinction between” these two defenses, United States v.\nBailey, 444 U. S. 394, 410 (1980), and “it would doubtless be possible to\ntreat [duress] as a branch of the law of necessity,” 2 LaFave §10.1(b), at\n121.\n4               ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\niably do not negate the mens rea necessary to incur crimi­\nnal liability. See 2 LaFave §10.1(a), at 118 (“The rationale\nof the necessity defense is not that a person, when faced\nwith the pressure of circumstances of nature, lacks the\nmental element which the crime in question requires”);\nid., §9.7(a), at 73 (same for duress).\n    This Court has made clear that, except in narrow cir­\ncumstances, necessity and duress do not negate the mens\nrea required for conviction. In Dixon v. United States, 548\nU. S. 1 (2006), the defendant was charged with “know-\ningly” and “willfully” committing certain criminal acts, but\nshe claimed that she committed the acts only because her\nboyfriend had threatened to kill her or hurt her daughters\nif she did not do so. Id., at 4. She contended that she\ncould not “have formed the necessary mens rea for these\ncrimes because she did not freely choose to commit the\nacts in question,” but we rejected that argument, explain­\ning that “[t]he duress defense, like the defense of necessity\n. . . , may excuse conduct that would otherwise be punish­\nable, but the existence of duress normally does not contro­\nvert any of the elements of the offense itself.” Id., at 6. In\na footnote, we suggested one situation in which the prose­\ncution might be required to disprove duress, namely,\nwhere a particular crime demands proof that the accused\nacted “maliciously,” which is to say “without justification\nor excuse.” Ibid., n. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n    The Court justifies its holding on the ground that the\nmens rea standard articulated in Nye & Nissen also falls\nwithin an exception to the general rule that proof of neces­\nsity or duress does not negate mens rea. Ante, at 16, n. 10.\nBut the Court, having refrained on pages 11–12 of its\nopinion from deciding whether aiding and abetting re­\nquires purposeful, as opposed to knowing, conduct, quickly\nand without explanation jettisons the “knowing” standard\nand concludes that purposeful conduct is needed. This is a\ncritical move because if it is enough for an alleged aider\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nand abettor simply to know that his confederate is carry­\ning a gun, then the alleged aider and abettor in the\nCourt’s hypothetical case (who spots the gun on the con­\nfederate’s person) unquestionably had the mens rea needed\nfor conviction.\n  But even accepting the Nye & Nissen standard as the\nexclusive means of proving the required mens rea, the\nCourt’s analysis is still quite wrong. Under the Nye &\nNissen standard, the Government must simply prove that\na defendant had as his conscious object that the hypothet­\nical drug sale (which, as the defendant knew, included the\ncarrying of a gun by one of the participants) go forward to\ncompletion. See Nye & Nissen, 336 U. S., at 619. Such\nintent is perfectly consistent with facts supporting a ne­\ncessity or duress defense. A person can certainly intend\nthe success of a criminal enterprise that he aids on the\nbelief that doing so will give rise to a lesser evil than his\nrefusal to participate would bring about.\n  The Court confuses two fundamentally distinct concepts:\nintent and motive. It seems to assume that, if a defend­\nant’s motive in aiding a criminal venture is to avoid some\ngreater evil, he does not have the intent that the venture\nsucceed. But the intent to undertake some act is of course\nperfectly consistent with the motive of avoiding adverse\nconsequences which would otherwise occur. We can all\ntestify to this from our daily experience. People wake up,\ngo to work, balance their checkbooks, shop for groceries—\nand yes, commit crimes—because they believe something\nbad will happen if they do not do these things, not because\nthe deepest desire of their heart is to do them. A person\nmay only go to work in the morning to keep his or her\nfamily from destitution; that does not mean he or she does\nnot intend to put in a full day’s work. In the same way,\nthe fact that a defendant carries out a crime because he\nfeels he must do so on pain of terrible consequences does\nnot mean he does not intend to carry out the crime. When\n6               ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nJean Valjean stole a loaf of bread to feed his starving\nfamily, he certainly intended to commit theft; the fact\nthat, had he been living in America today, he may have\npleaded necessity as a defense does not change that fact.\nSee V. Hugo, Les Misérables 54 (Fall River Press ed.\n2012).\n    Common-law commentators recognized this elementary\ndistinction between intent and motive. As Sir James\nFitzJames Stephen explains, if “A puts a loaded pistol to\nB’s temple and shoots B through the head deliberately,\n. . . . [i]t is obvious that in every such case the intention of\nA must be to kill B.” 2 A History of the Criminal Law of\nEngland 110–111 (1883). This fact “throws no light what­\never on A’s motives for killing B. They may have been\ninfinitely various. . . . The motive may have been a desire\nfor revenge, or a desire for plunder, or a wish on A’s part\nto defend himself against an attack by B, . . . or to put a\nman already mortally wounded out of his agony.” Id., at\n111. “In all these cases the intention is the same, but the\nmotives are different, and in all the intention may remain\nunchanged from first to last whilst the motives may vary\nfrom moment to moment.” Ibid.\n    Unsurprisingly, our cases have recognized that a lawful\nmotive (such as necessity, duress, or self-defense) is con­\nsistent with the mens rea necessary to satisfy a require­\nment of intent. In Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228 (1987),\nwe considered whether due process permitted the State of\nOhio to place the burden of proving self-defense on a de­\nfendant charged with aggravated murder. Under the Ohio\nstatute, aggravated murder consisted of “purposely, and\nwith prior calculation and design, caus[ing] the death of\nanother.” Id., at 230 (alteration in original; internal quo­\ntation marks omitted). Martin pleaded self-defense, which\nrequired her to prove that (1) she was “not at fault in\ncreating the situation giving rise to the argument” with\nthe victim, (2) she “had an honest belief that she was in\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nimminent danger of death or great bodily harm, and that\nher only means of escape from such danger was in the use\nof . . . force,” and (3) she “did not violate any duty to re­\ntreat or avoid danger.” Ibid. Martin argued that due\nprocess did not permit the State to impose the burden of\nproving self-defense on her, because proving self-defense\nwould necessarily negate the elements of aggravated\nmurder, which the State was required to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt. We disagreed, explaining that the\nelements which the State was required to prove to convict\nMartin were not the same as the elements which Martin\nwas required to prove to prevail on her self-defense theory.\nId., at 233. By so holding, we recognized that a defend­\nant’s purpose to kill another is not incompatible with that\ndefendant’s “honest belief that she was in imminent dan­\nger of death or great bodily harm” and that her use of force\nwas necessary to preserve her life. Id., at 230. In other\nwords, the fact that a defendant intends to kill another\nonly to avert mortal peril does not mean that the defend­\nant does not intend to kill.\n  That principle plays out in a wide variety of cases.\nUnited States v. Leal-Cruz, 431 F. 3d 667 (CA9 2005),\nprovides a good example. There, the Ninth Circuit had\nto decide whether a defendant could constitutionally be\nrequired to bear the burden of proving duress as a defense\nto conviction under 8 U. S. C. §1326 for attempted illegal\nreentry into the United States. Leal-Cruz pleaded duress,\ntestifying that he entered the United States only to escape\nthe deadly threat posed by abusive Mexican police officers\nwho were chasing him. 431 F. 3d, at 669. The Ninth\nCircuit had earlier held that the mens rea required for\nconviction for attempted illegal reentry was “purpose, i.e.,\nconscious desire, to reenter the United States.” Id., at\n671. The Court of Appeals nevertheless found that the\nConstitution permitted imposition of the burden of proving\nduress on Leal-Cruz, because proving duress did not re­\n8               ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nquire him to prove that he had not purposely entered the\nUnited States. As the Ninth Circuit explained, duress and\nthe mens rea requirement of intent did not overlap be­\ncause Leal-Cruz “had the ‘conscious desire’ to enter the\ncountry, even if the act of crossing the border was done to\nescape harm.” Id., at 673.\n   Thus, it seems inarguable to me that the existence of\nthe purpose or intent to carry out a crime is perfectly\ncompatible with facts giving rise to a necessity or duress\ndefense. Once that proposition is established, the Court’s\nerror is readily apparent. The Court requires the Gov­\nernment to prove that a defendant in Rosemond’s situa­\ntion could have walked away without risking harm greater\nthan he would cause by continuing with the crime—\ncircumstances that traditionally would support a necessity\nor duress defense. It imposes this requirement on the\nGovernment despite the fact that such dangerous circum­\nstances simply do not bear on whether the defendant\nintends the §924(c) offense to succeed, as (on the Court’s\nreading) is required for aiding and abetting liability.\n   The usual rule that a defendant bears the burden of\nproving affirmative defenses is justified by a compelling,\ncommonsense intuition: “[W]here the facts with regard to\nan issue lie peculiarly in the knowledge of a party, that\nparty is best situated to bear the burden of proof.” Smith\nv. United States, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6–7)\n(quoting Dixon, 548 U. S., at 9; alteration in original\nand internal quotation marks omitted). By abandoning\nthat rule in cases involving aiding and abetting of §924(c)\noffenses, the Court creates a perverse arrangement\nwhereby the prosecution must prove something that is\npeculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant. Imag­\nine that A aids B in committing a §924(c) offense and\nclaims that he only learned of the gun once the crime had\nbegun. If A had the burden of proof, he might testify that\nB was a hothead who had previously shot others who had\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ncrossed him. But under the Court’s rule, the prosecution,\nin order to show the intent needed to convict A as an aider\nand abettor, presumably has the burden of proving that B\nwas not such a person and that A did not believe him to\nbe. How is the prosecution to do this? By offering testi­\nmony by B’s friends and associates regarding his peaceful\nand easygoing nature? By introducing entries from A’s\ndiary in which he reflects on the sense of safety he feels\nwhen carrying out criminal enterprises in B’s company?\nFurthermore, even if B were a hothead and A knew him to\nbe such, A would presumably only be entitled to escape\nliability if he continued with the offense because of his fear\nof B’s reaction if he walked away. Under the Court’s rule,\nit is up to the Government to prove that A’s continued\nparticipation was not on account of his fear of B—but how?\nBy introducing footage of a convenient security camera\ndemonstrating that A’s eyes were not wide with fear, nor\nhis breathing rapid?\n   The Court’s rule breaks with the common-law tradition\nand our case law. It also makes no sense. I respectfully\ndissent from that portion of the Court’s opinion which\nplaces on the Government the burden of proving that the\nalleged aider and abettor of a §924(c) offense had what the\nCourt terms “a realistic opportunity” to refrain from en­\ngaging in the conduct at issue.\n</pre>", "id": 2655590, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/03/05/rosemond_v._united_states.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 12, 2013—Decided March 5, 2014\nPetitioner Justus Rosemond took part in a drug deal in which either he\n  or one of his confederates fired a gun. Because the shooter’s identity\n  was disputed, the Government charged Rosemond with violating 18\n  U. S. C. §924(c) by using or carrying a gun in connection with a drug\n  trafficking crime, or, in the alternative, aiding and abetting that of-\n  fense under 18 U. S. C. §2. The trial judge instructed the jury that\n  Rosemond was guilty of aiding and abetting the §924(c) offense if he\n  (1) “knew his cohort used a firearm in the drug trafficking crime” and\n  (2) “knowingly and actively participated in the drug trafficking\n  crime.” This deviated from Rosemond’s proposed instruction that the\n  jury must find that he acted intentionally “to facilitate or encourage”\n  the firearm’s use, as opposed to merely the predicate drug offense.\n  Rosemond was convicted, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed, rejecting\n  his argument that the District Court’s aiding and abetting instruc-\n  tions were erroneous.\nHeld:\n    1. The Government establishes that a defendant aided and abetted\n a §924(c) violation by proving that the defendant actively participat-\n ed in the underlying drug trafficking or violent crime with advance\n knowledge that a confederate would use or carry a gun during the\n crime’s commission. Pp. 5–16.\n       (a) The federal aiding and abetting statute, which derives from\n common-law standards for accomplice liability, has two components.\n A person is liable under §2 only if he (1) takes an affirmative act in\n furtherance of the underlying offense (2) with the intent to facilitate\n that offense’s commission. Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) The first question is whether Rosemond’s conduct was suffi-\n cient to satisfy the affirmative act requirement of aiding and abet-\n2                    ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ting. Section 924(c) has two elements: a drug deal or violent crime,\n    and using or carrying a firearm in connection with that crime. The\n    instructions permitted the jury to convict Rosemond of aiding and\n    abetting even if he facilitated only the drug element, and not the gun\n    element, of the §924(c) offense. Those instructions were correct. The\n    common law imposed aiding and abetting liability on a person who\n    facilitated any element of a criminal offense, even if he did not facili-\n    tate all elements. That principle continues to govern §2. See, e.g.,\n    United States v. Johnson, 319 U. S. 503, 515. Pp. 6–11.\n         (c) In addition to conduct extending to some part of the crime,\n    aiding and abetting requires intent extending to the whole crime.\n    The defendant must not just associate himself with the venture, but\n    also participate in it as something that he wishes to bring about and\n    seek by his actions to make it succeed. Nye & Nissen v. United\n    States, 336 U. S. 613, 619. That requirement is satisfied when a per-\n    son actively participates in a criminal venture with full knowledge of\n    the circumstances constituting the charged offense. See Pereira v.\n    United States, 347 U. S. 1, 12. An active participant in a drug trans-\n    action has the intent needed to aid and abet a §924(c) violation when\n    he knows that one of his confederates will carry a gun. This must be\n    advance knowledge—meaning, knowledge at a time when the accom-\n    plice has a reasonable opportunity to walk away. Pp. 11–16.\n      2. The trial court’s jury instructions were erroneous because they\n    failed to require that Rosemond knew in advance that one of his co-\n    horts would be armed. In telling the jury to consider merely whether\n    Rosemond “knew his cohort used a firearm,” the court did not direct\n    the jury to determine when Rosemond obtained the requisite\n    knowledge—i.e., to decide whether Rosemond knew about the gun in\n    sufficient time to withdraw from the crime. The case is remanded to\n    permit the Tenth Circuit to address whether this objection was\n    properly preserved and whether any error was harmless.

We also conclude that the jury in-\nstructions given below were erroneous because they failed\nto require that the defendant knew in advance that one of\nhis cohorts would be armed.\n                           I\n  This case arises from a drug deal gone bad. Vashti\nPerez arranged to sell a pound of marijuana to Ricardo\nGonzales and Coby Painter. She drove to a local park to\nmake the exchange, accompanied by two confederates,\n——————\n * JUSTICE SCALIA joins all but footnotes 7 and 8 of this opinion.\n2                 ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nRonald Joseph and petitioner Justus Rosemond. One of\nthose men apparently took the front passenger seat and\nthe other sat in the back, but witnesses dispute who was\nwhere. At the designated meeting place, Gonzales climbed\ninto the car’s backseat while Painter waited outside. The\nbackseat passenger allowed Gonzales to inspect the mari-\njuana. But rather than handing over money, Gonzales\npunched that man in the face and fled with the drugs. As\nGonzales and Painter ran away, one of the male passengers—\nbut again, which one is contested—exited the car and\nfired several shots from a semiautomatic handgun. The\nshooter then re-entered the vehicle, and all three would-\nbe drug dealers gave chase after the buyers-turned-\nrobbers. But before the three could catch their quarry,\na police officer, responding to a dispatcher’s alert, pulled\ntheir car over. This federal prosecution of Rosemond\nfollowed.1\n   The Government charged Rosemond with, inter alia,\nviolating §924(c) by using a gun in connection with a drug\ntrafficking crime, or aiding and abetting that offense\nunder §2 of Title 18. Section 924(c) provides that “any\nperson who, during and in relation to any crime of violence\nor drug trafficking crime[,] . . . uses or carries a firearm,”\nshall receive a five-year mandatory-minimum sentence,\nwith seven- and ten-year minimums applicable, respec-\ntively, if the firearm is also brandished or discharged. 18\nU. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A). Section 2, for its part, is the federal\naiding and abetting statute: It provides that “[w]hoever\ncommits an offense against the United States or aids,\nabets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its com-\nmission is punishable as a principal.”\n   Consistent with the indictment, the Government prose-\n——————\n  1 The Government agreed not to bring charges against the other four\n\nparticipants in the narcotics deal in exchange for their giving truthful\ntestimony against Rosemond. See 2 Record 245, 272, 295–296, 318.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncuted the §924(c) charge on two alternative theories. The\nGovernment’s primary contention was that Rosemond\nhimself used the firearm during the aborted drug transac-\ntion. But recognizing that the identity of the shooter was\ndisputed, the Government also offered a back-up argu-\nment: Even if it was Joseph who fired the gun as the drug\ndeal fell apart, Rosemond aided and abetted the §924(c)\nviolation.\n   The District Judge accordingly instructed the jury on\naiding and abetting law. He first explained, in a way\nchallenged by neither party, the rudiments of §2. Under\nthat statute, the judge stated, “[a] person who aids or\nabets another to commit an offense is just as guilty of that\noffense as if he committed it himself.” App. 195. And in\norder to aid or abet, the defendant must “willfully and\nknowingly associate[ ] himself in some way with the crime,\nand . . . seek[ ] by some act to help make the crime suc-\nceed.” Id., at 196. The judge then turned to applying\nthose general principles to §924(c)—and there, he deviated\nfrom an instruction Rosemond had proposed. According to\nRosemond, a defendant could be found guilty of aiding or\nabetting a §924(c) violation only if he “intentionally took\nsome action to facilitate or encourage the use of the fire-\narm,” as opposed to the predicate drug offense. Id., at 14.\nBut the District Judge disagreed, instead telling the jury\nthat it could convict if “(1) the defendant knew his cohort\nused a firearm in the drug trafficking crime, and (2) the\ndefendant knowingly and actively participated in the drug\ntrafficking crime.” Id., at 196. In closing argument, the\nprosecutor contended that Rosemond easily satisfied that\nstandard, so that even if he had not “fired the gun, he’s\nstill guilty of the crime.” Id., at 158. After all, the prose-\ncutor stated, Rosemond “certainly knew [of] and actively\nparticipated in” the drug transaction. Ibid. “And with\nregards to the other element,” the prosecutor urged, “the\nfact is a person cannot be present and active at a drug deal\n4                 ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen shots are fired and not know their cohort is using a\ngun. You simply can’t do it.” Ibid.\n   The jury convicted Rosemond of violating §924(c) (as\nwell as all other offenses charged). The verdict form was\ngeneral: It did not reveal whether the jury found that\nRosemond himself had used the gun or instead had aided\nand abetted a confederate’s use during the marijuana deal.\nAs required by §924(c), the trial court imposed a consec-\nutive sentence of 120 months of imprisonment for the\nstatute’s violation.\n   The Tenth Circuit affirmed, rejecting Rosemond’s argu-\nment that the District Court’s aiding and abetting instruc-\ntions were erroneous.2 The Court of Appeals acknowledged\nthat some other Circuits agreed with Rosemond that\na defendant aids and abets a §924(c) offense only if he\nintentionally takes “some action to facilitate or encourage\nhis cohort’s use of the firearm.” 695 F. 3d 1151, 1155\n(2012).3 But the Tenth Circuit had already adopted a\ndifferent standard, which it thought consonant with the\nDistrict Court’s instructions. See, e.g., United States v.\nWiseman, 172 F. 3d 1196, 1217 (1999) (requiring that the\ndefendant “actively participated in the” underlying crime\nand “knew [his confederate] was carrying [a] firearm”).\nAnd the Court of Appeals held that Rosemond had pre-\nsented no sufficient reason for departing from that prece-\ndent. See 695 F. 3d, at 1156.\n   We granted certiorari, 569 U. S. ___ (2013), to resolve\n\n——————\n   2 The Court of Appeals stated that it had to address that argument\n\neven if the jury could have found that Rosemond himself fired the gun,\nbecause “a conviction based on a general verdict is subject to challenge\nif the jury was instructed on alternative theories of guilt and may have\nrelied on an invalid one.” 695 F. 3d 1151, 1154 (2012) (quoting\nHedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. 57, 58 (2008) (per curiam)).\n   3 See, e.g., United States v. Rolon-Ramos, 502 F. 3d 750, 758–759\n\n(CA8 2007); United States v.

Although we disagree with Rosemond’s\nprincipal arguments, we find that the trial court erred in\ninstructing the jury. We therefore vacate the judgment\nbelow.\n                              II\n  The federal aiding and abetting statute, 18 U. S. C. §2,\nstates that a person who furthers—more specifically, who\n“aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures”—\nthe commission of a federal offense “is punishable as a\nprincipal.” That provision derives from (though simplifies)\ncommon-law standards for accomplice liability. See, e.g.,\nStandefer v. United States, 447 U. S. 10, 14–19 (1980);\nUnited States v. Peoni, 100 F. 2d 401, 402 (CA2 1938)\n(L. Hand, J.) (“The substance of [§2’s] formula goes back\na long way”). And in so doing, §2 reflects a centuries-old\nview of culpability: that a person may be responsible for a\ncrime he has not personally carried out if he helps another\nto complete its commission. See J. Hawley & M. McGregor,\nCriminal Law 81 (1899).\n  We have previously held that under §2 “those who pro-\nvide knowing aid to persons committing federal crimes,\nwith the intent to facilitate the crime, are themselves\ncommitting a crime.” Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v.\nFirst Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 181\n(1994). Both parties here embrace that formulation, and\nagree as well that it has two components. See Brief for\nPetitioner 28; Brief for United States 14. As at common\nlaw, a person is liable under §2 for aiding and abetting a\ncrime if (and only if) he (1) takes an affirmative act in\nfurtherance of that offense, (2) with the intent of facili-\ntating the offense’s commission. See 2 W. LaFave, Sub-\nstantive Criminal Law §13.2, p. 337 (2003) (hereinafter\nLaFave) (an accomplice is liable as a principal when he gives\n“assistance or encouragement . . . with the intent thereby\n6              ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto promote or facilitate commission of the crime”); Hicks v.\nUnited States, 150 U. S. 442, 449 (1893) (an accomplice is\nliable when his acts of assistance are done “with the inten-\ntion of encouraging and abetting” the crime).\n   The questions that the parties dispute, and we here\naddress, concern how those two requirements—affirmative\nact and intent—apply in a prosecution for aiding and\nabetting a §924(c) offense. Those questions arise from the\ncompound nature of that provision. Recall that §924(c)\nforbids “us[ing] or carr[ying] a firearm” when engaged in a\n“crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.” See supra, at\n2. The prosecutor must show the use or carriage of a gun;\nso too he must prove the commission of a predicate (violent\nor drug trafficking) offense. See Smith v. United States,\n508 U. S. 223, 228 (1993). For purposes of ascertaining\naiding and abetting liability, we therefore must consider:\nWhen does a person act to further this double-barreled\ncrime? And when does he intend to facilitate its commis-\nsion? We address each issue in turn.\n                               A\n   Consider first Rosemond’s account of his conduct (di-\nvorced from any issues of intent). Rosemond actively par-\nticipated in a drug transaction, accompanying two others\nto a site where money was to be exchanged for a pound\nof marijuana. But as he tells it, he took no action\nwith respect to any firearm. He did not buy or borrow a\ngun to facilitate the narcotics deal; he did not carry a gun\nto the scene; he did not use a gun during the subsequent\nevents constituting this criminal misadventure. His acts thus\nadvanced one part (the drug part) of a two-part incident—\nor to speak a bit more technically, one element (the\ndrug element) of a two-element crime. Is that enough to\nsatisfy the conduct requirement of this aiding and abetting\ncharge, or must Rosemond, as he claims, have taken some\nact to assist the commission of the other (firearm) compo-\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnent of §924(c)?\n   The common law imposed aiding and abetting liability\non a person (possessing the requisite intent) who facili-\ntated any part—even though not every part—of a criminal\nventure. As a leading treatise, published around the time\nof §2’s enactment, put the point: Accomplice liability at-\ntached upon proof of “[a]ny participation in a general\nfelonious plan” carried out by confederates. 1 F. Wharton,\nCriminal Law §251, p. 322 (11th ed. 1912) (hereinafter\nWharton) (emphasis added). Or in the words of another\nstandard reference: If a person was “present abetting\nwhile any act necessary to constitute the offense [was]\nbeing performed through another,” he could be charged as\na principal—even “though [that act was] not the whole\nthing necessary.” 1 J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Crim-\ninal Law §649, p. 392 (7th ed. 1882) (emphasis added).\nAnd so “[w]here several acts constitute[d] together one\ncrime, if each [was] separately performed by a different\nindividual[,] . . . all [were] principals as to the whole.” Id.,\n§650, at 392.4 Indeed, as yet a third treatise underscored,\na person’s involvement in the crime could be not merely\npartial but minimal too: “The quantity [of assistance was]\nimmaterial,” so long as the accomplice did “something” to\naid the crime. R. Desty, A Compendium of American\nCriminal Law §37a, p. 106 (1882) (emphasis added). After\nall, the common law maintained, every little bit helps—\nand a contribution to some part of a crime aids the whole.\n\n——————\n  4 The Wharton treatise gave the following example of how multiple\n\nconfederates could perform different roles in carrying out a crime.\nAssume, Wharton hypothesized, that several persons “act in concert to\nsteal a man’s goods.” Wharton §251, at 322. The victim is “induced by\nfraud to trust one of them[,] in the presence of [the] others[,] with the\n[goods’] possession.” Ibid. Afterward, “another of the party entice[s]\nthe owner away so that he who has the goods may carry them off.” Id.,\nat 322–323. Wharton concludes: “[A]ll are guilty as principals.” Id.,\nat 323.\n8                  ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   That principle continues to govern aiding and abetting\nlaw under §2: As almost every court of appeals has held,\n“[a] defendant can be convicted as an aider and abettor\nwithout proof that he participated in each and every ele-\nment of the offense.” United States v. Sigalow, 812 F. 2d\n783, 785 (CA2 1987).5 In proscribing aiding and abetting,\nCongress used language that “comprehends all assistance\nrendered by words, acts, encouragement, support, or pres-\nence,” Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170, 178 (1993)—\neven if that aid relates to only one (or some) of a crime’s\nphases or elements. So, for example, in upholding convic-\ntions for abetting a tax evasion scheme, this Court found\n“irrelevant” the defendants’ “non-participation” in filing a\nfalse return; we thought they had amply facilitated the\nillegal scheme by helping a confederate conceal his assets.\nUnited States v. Johnson, 319 U. S. 503, 515, 518 (1943).\n“[A]ll who shared in [the overall crime’s] execution,” we\nexplained, “have equal responsibility before the law, what-\never may have been [their] different roles.” Id., at 515.\nAnd similarly, we approved a conviction for abetting mail\nfraud even though the defendant had played no part in\nmailing the fraudulent documents; it was enough to sat-\nisfy the law’s conduct requirement that he had in other\nways aided the deception. See Pereira v. United States,\n347 U. S. 1, 8–11 (1954). The division of labor between\ntwo (or more) confederates thus has no significance: A\nstrategy of “you take that element, I’ll take this one”\n——————\n   5 See also United States v. Ali, 718 F. 3d 929, 939 (CADC 2013)\n\n(“[P]roving a defendant guilty of aiding and abetting does not ordinarily\nrequire the government to establish participation in each . . . element of\nthe underlying offense”); United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, 449 F. 3d\n1168, 1176 (CA11 2006) (“The government was not required to prove\nthat [the defendant] participated in each element of the substantive\noffense in order to hold him liable as an aider and abettor”); United\nStates v. Woods, 148 F. 3d 843, 850 (CA7 1998) (“[T]he government\nneed not prove assistance related to every element of the underlying\noffense”). And so forth and so on.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U. S.\n275, 280 (1999); see supra, at 6. In enacting the statute,\n“Congress proscribed both the use of the firearm and the\ncommission of acts that constitute” a drug trafficking\ncrime. Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U. S, at 281. Rosemond\ntherefore could assist in §924(c)’s violation by facilitating\neither the drug transaction or the firearm use (or of course\nboth). In helping to bring about one part of the offense\n(whether trafficking drugs or using a gun), he necessarily\nhelped to complete the whole. And that ends the analysis\nas to his conduct. It is inconsequential, as courts applying\nboth the common law and §2 have held, that his acts did\nnot advance each element of the offense; all that matters\nis that they facilitated one component.\n   Rosemond argues, to the contrary, that the requisite act\nhere “must be directed at the use of the firearm,” because\nthat element is §924(c)’s most essential feature. Brief for\nPetitioner 33 (arguing that “it is the firearm crime” he was\nreally charged with aiding and abetting, “not the drug\ntrafficking crime”). But Rosemond can provide no author-\n——————\n   6 Consider a hypothetical similar to Johnson and Pereira (and a mod-\n\nern variant of the Wharton treatise’s, see n. 4, supra). Suppose that as\npart of a kidnapping scheme, one accomplice lures the victim into a car\nunder false pretenses; another drives the vehicle; a third allows the use\nof her house to hold the victim captive; and still a fourth keeps watch\noutside to divert potential witnesses. None would have personally\ncompleted, or even assisted with, all elements of the offense. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cervantes-Blanco, 504 F. 3d 576, 580 (CA5 2007)\n(listing elements). But (if they had the requisite intent) all would be\nliable under §2.\n10             ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nity for demanding that an affirmative act go toward an\nelement considered peculiarly significant; rather, as just\nnoted, courts have never thought relevant the importance\nof the aid rendered. See supra, at 7–8. And in any event,\nwe reject Rosemond’s premise that §924(c) is somehow\nmore about using guns than selling narcotics. It is true\nenough, as Rosemond says in support of that theory, that\n§924(c) “establishes a separate, freestanding offense that\nis ‘distinct from the underlying [drug trafficking crime].’ ”\nBrief for Petitioner 32 (quoting Simpson v. United States,\n435 U. S. 6, 10 (1978)). But it is just as true that §924(c)\nestablishes a freestanding offense distinct from any that\nmight apply just to using a gun—say, for discharging a\nfirearm in a public park. That is because §924(c) is, to\ncoin a term, a combination crime. It punishes the tem-\nporal and relational conjunction of two separate acts, on\nthe ground that together they pose an extreme risk of\nharm. See Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 132\n(1998) (noting that §924(c)’s “basic purpose” was “to com-\nbat the dangerous combination of drugs and guns”). And\nso, an act relating to drugs, just as much as an act relating\nto guns, facilitates a §924(c) violation.\n   Rosemond’s related argument that our approach would\nconflate two distinct offenses—allowing a conviction for\nabetting a §924(c) violation whenever the prosecution\nshows that the defendant abetted the underlying drug\ntrafficking crime—fares no better. See Brief for Petitioner\n38. That is because, as we will describe, an aiding and\nabetting conviction requires not just an act facilitating one\nor another element, but also a state of mind extending to\nthe entire crime. See infra, at 11. And under that rule, a\ndefendant may be convicted of abetting a §924(c) violation\nonly if his intent reaches beyond a simple drug sale, to an\narmed one. Aiding and abetting law’s intent component—\nto which we now turn—thus preserves the distinction\nbetween assisting the predicate drug trafficking crime and\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nassisting the broader §924(c) offense.\n                               B\n  Begin with (or return to) some basics about aiding and\nabetting law’s intent requirement, which no party here\ndisputes. As previously explained, a person aids and abets\na crime when (in addition to taking the requisite act) he\nintends to facilitate that offense’s commission. See supra,\nat 5–6. An intent to advance some different or lesser\noffense is not, or at least not usually, sufficient: Instead,\nthe intent must go to the specific and entire crime\ncharged—so here, to the full scope (predicate crime plus\ngun use) of §924(c). See, e.g., 2 LaFave §13.2(c); W. Clark\n& W. Marshall, Law of Crimes, §187, pp. 251–253 (2d ed.\n1905); ALI, Model Penal Code §2.06 Comment, p. 306\n(1985).7 And the canonical formulation of that needed\nstate of mind—later appropriated by this Court and oft-\nquoted in both parties’ briefs—is Judge Learned Hand’s:\nTo aid and abet a crime, a defendant must not just “in\nsome sort associate himself with the venture,” but also\n“participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring\nabout” and “seek by his action to make it succeed.” Nye &\nNissen v. United States, 336 U. S. 613, 619 (1949) (quoting\nPeoni, 100 F. 2d, at 402; see Brief for Petitioner 20, 28, 41;\nBrief for United States 14, 51.\n  We have previously found that intent requirement\nsatisfied when a person actively participates in a criminal\nventure with full knowledge of the circumstances consti-\n——————\n   7 Some authorities suggest an exception to the general rule when\n\nanother crime is the “natural and probable consequence” of the crime\nthe defendant intended to abet. See, e.g., 2 LaFave §13.3(b), at 356\n(citing cases); but see id., §13.3 (“Under the better view, one is not an\naccomplice to a crime merely because . . . that crime was a natural and\nprobable consequence of another offense as to which he is an accom-\nplice”). That question is not implicated here, because no one contends\nthat a §924(c) violation is a natural and probable consequence of simple\ndrug trafficking. We therefore express no view on the issue.\n12                ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntuting the charged offense. In Pereira, the mail fraud case\ndiscussed above, we found the requisite intent for aiding\nand abetting because the defendant took part in a fraud\n“know[ing]” that his confederate would take care of the\nmailing. 347 U. S., at 12; see supra, at 8. Likewise, in\nBozza v. United States, 330 U. S. 160, 165 (1947), we up-\nheld a conviction for aiding and abetting the evasion of\nliquor taxes because the defendant helped operate a clan-\ndestine distillery “know[ing]” the business was set up “to\nviolate Government revenue laws.” And several Courts of\nAppeals have similarly held—addressing a fact pattern\nmuch like this one—that the unarmed driver of a getaway\ncar had the requisite intent to aid and abet armed bank\nrobbery if he “knew” that his confederates would use\nweapons in carrying out the crime. See, e.g., United States\nv. Akiti, 701 F. 3d 883, 887 (CA8 2012); United States v.\nEaster, 66 F. 3d 1018, 1024 (CA9 1995). So for purposes of\naiding and abetting law, a person who actively partici-\npates in a criminal scheme knowing its extent and charac-\nter intends that scheme’s commission.8\n   The same principle holds here: An active participant in\na drug transaction has the intent needed to aid and abet a\n§924(c) violation when he knows that one of his confeder-\nates will carry a gun. In such a case, the accomplice has\ndecided to join in the criminal venture, and share in its\nbenefits, with full awareness of its scope—that the plan\ncalls not just for a drug sale, but for an armed one. In so\ndoing, he has chosen (like the abettors in Pereira and\nBozza or the driver in an armed robbery) to align himself\n——————\n   8 We did not deal in these cases, nor do we here, with defendants who\n\nincidentally facilitate a criminal venture rather than actively partici-\npate in it. A hypothetical case is the owner of a gun store who sells a\nfirearm to a criminal, knowing but not caring how the gun will be used.\nWe express no view about what sort of facts, if any, would suffice to\nshow that such a third party has the intent necessary to be convicted of\naiding and abetting.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the illegal scheme in its entirety—including its use of\na firearm. And he has determined (again like those other\nabettors) to do what he can to “make [that scheme] suc-\nceed.” Nye & Nissen, 336 U. S., at 619. He thus becomes\nresponsible, in the typical way of aiders and abettors, for\nthe conduct of others. He may not have brought the gun\nto the drug deal himself, but because he took part in that\ndeal knowing a confederate would do so, he intended the\ncommission of a §924(c) offense—i.e., an armed drug sale.\n  For all that to be true, though, the §924(c) defendant’s\nknowledge of a firearm must be advance knowledge—or\notherwise said, knowledge that enables him to make the\nrelevant legal (and indeed, moral) choice. When an ac-\ncomplice knows beforehand of a confederate’s design to\ncarry a gun, he can attempt to alter that plan or, if unsuc-\ncessful, withdraw from the enterprise; it is deciding in-\nstead to go ahead with his role in the venture that shows\nhis intent to aid an armed offense. But when an accom-\nplice knows nothing of a gun until it appears at the scene,\nhe may already have completed his acts of assistance; or\neven if not, he may at that late point have no realistic\nopportunity to quit the crime. And when that is so, the\ndefendant has not shown the requisite intent to assist a\ncrime involving a gun. As even the Government concedes,\nan unarmed accomplice cannot aid and abet a §924(c)\nviolation unless he has “foreknowledge that his confeder-\nate will commit the offense with a firearm.” Brief for\nUnited States 38; see also infra, at 15–17. For the reasons\njust given, we think that means knowledge at a time the\naccomplice can do something with it—most notably, opt to\nwalk away.9\n——————\n  9 Of course, if a defendant continues to participate in a crime after a\n\ngun was displayed or used by a confederate, the jury can permissibly\ninfer from his failure to object or withdraw that he had such knowledge.\nIn any criminal case, after all, the factfinder can draw inferences about\na defendant’s intent based on all the facts and circumstances of a\n14               ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Both parties here find something to dislike in our view\nof this issue. Rosemond argues that a participant in a\ndrug deal intends to assist a §924(c) violation only if he\naffirmatively desires one of his confederates to use a gun.\nSee Reply Brief 8–11. The jury, Rosemond concedes, could\ninfer that state of mind from the defendant’s advance\nknowledge that the plan included a firearm. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 5. But according to Rosemond, the instructions\nmust also permit the jury to draw the opposite conclusion—\nthat although the defendant participated in a drug\ndeal knowing a gun would be involved, he did not spe-\ncifically want its carriage or use. That higher standard,\nRosemond claims, is necessary to avoid subjecting persons\nof different culpability to the same punishment. Rose-\nmond offers as an example an unarmed driver assisting in\nthe heist of a store: If that person spent the drive “trying\nto persuade [his confederate] to leave [the] gun behind,”\nthen he should be convicted of abetting shoplifting, but not\narmed robbery. Reply Brief 9.\n   We think not. What matters for purposes of gauging\nintent, and so what jury instructions should convey, is\nthat the defendant has chosen, with full knowledge, to\nparticipate in the illegal scheme—not that, if all had been\nleft to him, he would have planned the identical crime.\nConsider a variant of Rosemond’s example: The driver of a\ngetaway car wants to help rob a convenience store (and\nargues passionately for that plan), but eventually accedes\nwhen his confederates decide instead to hold up a national\nbank. Whatever his original misgivings, he has the requi-\nsite intent to aid and abet bank robbery; after all, he put\naside those doubts and knowingly took part in that more\ndangerous crime. The same is true of an accomplice who\nknowingly joins in an armed drug transaction—regardless\nwhether he was formerly indifferent or even resistant to\n——————\ncrime’s commission.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nusing firearms. The law does not, nor should it, care\nwhether he participates with a happy heart or a sense of\nforeboding. Either way, he has the same culpability,\nbecause either way he has knowingly elected to aid in the\ncommission of a peculiarly risky form of offense.\n  A final, metaphorical way of making the point: By virtue\nof §924(c), using a firearm at a drug deal ups the ante. A\nwould-be accomplice might decide to play at those perilous\nstakes. Or he might grasp that the better course is to fold\nhis hand. What he should not expect is the capacity to\nhedge his bets, joining in a dangerous criminal scheme but\nevading its penalties by leaving use of the gun to someone\nelse. Aiding and abetting law prevents that outcome, so\nlong as the player knew the heightened stakes when he\ndecided to stay in the game.\n  The Government, for its part, thinks we take too strict a\nview of when a defendant charged with abetting a §924(c)\nviolation must acquire that knowledge. As noted above,\nthe Government recognizes that the accused accomplice\nmust have “foreknowledge” of a gun’s presence. Brief for\nUnited States 38; see supra, at 13. But the Government\nviews that standard as met whenever the accomplice,\nhaving learned of the firearm, continues any act of assist-\ning the drug transaction. See Brief for United States 48.\nAccording to the Government, the jury should convict such\na defendant even if he became aware of the gun only after\nhe realistically could have opted out of the crime.\n  But that approach, we think, would diminish too far the\nrequirement that a defendant in a §924(c) prosecution\nmust intend to further an armed drug deal. Assume,\nfor example, that an accomplice agrees to participate in a\ndrug sale on the express condition that no one brings a\ngun to the place of exchange. But just as the parties are\nmaking the trade, the accomplice notices that one of his\nconfederates has a (poorly) concealed firearm in his jacket.\nThe Government would convict the accomplice of aiding\n16                 ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand abetting a §924(c) offense if he assists in completing\nthe deal without incident, rather than running away or\notherwise aborting the sale. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40. But\nbehaving as the Government suggests might increase the\nrisk of gun violence—to the accomplice himself, other\nparticipants, or bystanders; and conversely, finishing the\nsale might be the best or only way to avoid that danger.\nIn such a circumstance, a jury is entitled to find that the\ndefendant intended only a drug sale—that he never in-\ntended to facilitate, and so does not bear responsibility for,\na drug deal carried out with a gun. A defendant manifests\nthat greater intent, and incurs the greater liability of\n§924(c), when he chooses to participate in a drug transac-\ntion knowing it will involve a firearm; but he makes no\nsuch choice when that knowledge comes too late for him to\nbe reasonably able to act upon it.10\n                             III\n     Under these principles, the District Court erred in\n——————\n   10 Contrary to the dissent’s view, see post, at 3–4, nothing in this\n\nholding changes the way the defenses of duress and necessity operate.\nNeither does our decision remotely deny that the “intent to undertake\nsome act is . . . perfectly consistent with the motive of avoiding adverse\nconsequences which would otherwise occur.” Post, at 5. Our holding is\ngrounded in the distinctive intent standard for aiding and abetting\nsomeone else’s act—in the words of Judge Hand, that a defendant must\nnot just “in some sort associate himself with the venture” (as seems to\nbe good enough for the dissent), but also “participate in it as in some-\nthing that he wishes to bring about” and “seek by his action to make it\nsucceed.” Nye & Nissen v. United States, 336 U. S. 613, 619 (1949)\n(quoting Peoni, 100 F. 2d, at 402). For the reasons just given, see\nsupra, at 13, 15–16, we think that intent standard cannot be satisfied if\na defendant charged with aiding and abetting a §924(c) offense learns\nof a gun only after he can realistically walk away—i.e., when he has no\nopportunity to decide whether “he wishes to bring about” (or make\nsucceed) an armed drug transaction, rather than a simple drug crime.\nAnd because a defendant’s prior knowledge is part of the intent re-\nquired to aid and abet a §924(c) offense, the burden to prove it resides\nwith the Government.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninstructing the jury, because it did not explain that Rose-\nmond needed advance knowledge of a firearm’s presence.\nRecall that the court stated that Rosemond was guilty of\naiding and abetting if “(1) [he] knew his cohort used a\nfirearm in the drug trafficking crime, and (2) [he] know-\ningly and actively participated in the drug trafficking\ncrime.” App. 196. We agree with that instruction’s second\nhalf: As we have explained, active participation in a drug\nsale is sufficient for §924(c) liability (even if the conduct\ndoes not extend to the firearm), so long as the defendant\nhad prior knowledge of the gun’s involvement. See supra,\nat 9, 11–13. The problem with the court’s instruction\ncame in its description of that knowledge requirement. In\ntelling the jury to consider merely whether Rosemond\n“knew his cohort used a firearm,” the court did not direct\nthe jury to determine when Rosemond obtained the requi-\nsite knowledge. So, for example, the jury could have\nconvicted even if Rosemond first learned of the gun when\nit was fired and he took no further action to advance the\ncrime. For that reason, the Government itself describes\nthe instruction’s first half as “potentially misleading,”\ncandidly explaining that “it would have been clearer to\nsay” that Rosemond had to know that his confederate\n“ ‘ would use’ [a firearm] or something . . . that makes\nabsolutely clear that you [need] foreknowledge.” Tr. of\nOral Arg. 48–49. We agree with that view, and then some:\nThe court’s statement failed to convey that Rosemond had\nto have advance knowledge, of the kind we have described,\nthat a confederate would be armed. See supra, at 13,\n15–16.\n    The Government contends that this problematic instruc-\ntion looks more accurate when viewed in context. In\nparticular, the Government points to the District Court’s\nprefatory “umbrella instruction” that to aid or abet a\ncrime, a defendant must “willfully and knowingly seek[ ]\nby some act to help make the crime succeed.” App. 196;\n18             ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for United States 49. That statement, the Govern-\nment rightly notes, “mirrors” Judge Hand’s classic formu-\nlation. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33; see supra, at 11. But the\nstatement is also pitched at a high level of generality.\nImmediately afterward, the District Court provided the\njury with the two-pronged test noted above—thus indicat-\ning how the broad principle should apply to the specific\ncharge of abetting a §924(c) offense. We therefore do not\nsee how the “umbrella” statement could have cured the\ncourt’s error. Indeed, a different contextual feature of the\ncase would only have amplified that mistake. As earlier\ndescribed, the prosecutor asserted in closing argument\nthat the court’s test was easily satisfied because “a person\ncannot be present and active at a drug deal when shots are\nfired and not know their cohort is using a gun.” App. 158;\nsee supra, at 3–4. The prosecutor thus invited the jury to\nconvict Rosemond even if he first learned of the gun as\nit was discharged, and no matter what he did afterward.\nOnce again, then, the message to the jury was that it need\nnot find advance knowledge—exactly what we (and for\nthat matter the Government) have said is required.\n   We send this case back to the Tenth Circuit to consider\nthe appropriate consequence, if any, of the District Court’s\nerror. The Government makes two arguments relevant to\nthat inquiry. First, it contends that Rosemond failed to\nobject specifically to the part of the trial court’s instruc-\ntions we have found wanting; thus, the Government as-\nserts, a plain-error standard should apply to his claim.\nSee Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b); Johnson v. United States,\n520 U. S. 461, 465–467 (1997). Second, the Government\nargues that any error in the court’s aiding and abetting\ninstruction was harmless, because the jury must have\nfound (based on another part of its verdict, not discussed\nhere) that Rosemond himself fired the gun. Those claims\nwere not raised or addressed below, and we see no special\nreason to decide them in the first instance. See Travelers\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Specifically, I\nreject the Court’s conclusion that a conviction for aiding\nand abetting a violation of 18 U. S. C. §924(c) demands\nproof that the alleged aider and abettor had what the\nCourt terms “a realistic opportunity” to refrain from en­\ngaging in the conduct at issue.1 Ante, at 13. This rule\nrepresents an important and, as far as I am aware, un­\nprecedented alteration of the law of aiding and abetting\nand of the law of intentionality generally.\n   To explain my disagreement with the Court’s analysis, I\nbegin with our case law on the mens rea required to estab­\nlish aiding and abetting. There is some tension in our\n——————\n   1 I am also concerned that the Court’s use, without clarification, of the\n\nphrase “advance knowledge” will lead readers astray. E.g., ante, at 1.\nViewed by itself, the phrase most naturally means knowledge acquired\nin advance of the commission of the drug trafficking offense, but this\nis not what the Court means. Rather, “advance knowledge,” as used by\nthe Court, may include knowledge acquired while the drug trafficking\noffense is in progress. Specifically, a defendant has such knowledge,\nthe Court says, if he or she first learns of the gun while the drug offense\nis in progress and at that time “realistically could have opted out of the\ncrime.” Ante, at 15.\n2              ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ncases on this point. Specifically, some of our cases suggest\nthat an aider and abettor must act purposefully or with\nintent. Prominent among these cases is Nye & Nissen v.\nUnited States, 336 U. S. 613 (1949), which the Court\nquotes. See ante, at 16, n. 10. In that case, the Court,\nquoting Judge Learned Hand’s formulation in United\nStates v. Peoni, 100 F. 2d 401 (CA2 1938), said that an\naider and abettor must “ ‘participate in [the crime] as in\nsomething that he wishes to bring about, [and] seek by his\naction to make it succeed.’ ” 336 U. S., at 619.\n   On the other hand, there are cases to which the Court\nalso refers, ante, at 12, that appear to hold that the requi­\nsite mens rea is simply knowledge. See Pereira v. United\nStates, 347 U. S. 1, 12 (1954); Bozza v. United States, 330\nU. S. 160, 164–165 (1947). The Court refers interchange­\nably to both of these tests and thus leaves our case law in\nthe same, somewhat conflicted state that previously ex-\nisted. But because the difference between acting purpose­\nfully (when that concept is properly understood) and acting\nknowingly is slight, this is not a matter of great concern.\n   Beginning on page 13, however, the Court veers off in a\nnew and, to my mind, most unfortunate direction. The\nCourt imagines the following situation:\n     “[A]n accomplice agrees to participate in a drug sale\n     on the express condition that no one brings a gun to\n     the place of exchange. But just as the parties are\n     making the trade, the accomplice notices that one of\n     his confederates has a (poorly) concealed firearm in\n     his jacket.” Ante, at 15.\nIf the accomplice, despite spotting the gun, continues to\nassist in the completion of the drug sale, has the accom­\nplice aided and abetted the commission of a violation of\n§924(c)?\n   The Court’s answer is “it depends.” Walking away, the\nCourt observes, “might increase the risk of gun violence—\nto the accomplice himself, other participants, or bystand­\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

Moreover—\nand this is where the seriously misguided step occurs—the\nCourt says that if the risk of walking away exceeds (by\nsome unspecified degree) the risk created by completing\nthe sale and if the alleged aider and abettor chooses to\ncontinue for that reason, the alleged aider and abettor\nlacks the mens rea required for conviction. See ante, at 16,\nn. 10.\n   What the Court has done is to convert what has up to\nnow been an affirmative defense into a part of the re­\nquired mens rea, and this step has very important concep­\ntual and practical consequences. It fundamentally alters\nthe prior understanding of mental states that form the\nfoundation of substantive criminal law, and it places a\nstrange and difficult burden on the prosecution.\n   That the Court has taken a radical step can be seen by\ncomparing what the Court now holds with the traditional\ndefense of necessity. That defense excuses a violation of\nlaw if “the harm which will result from compliance with\nthe law is greater than that which will result from viola­\ntion of it.” 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §10.1,\np. 116 (2003) (hereinafter LaFave).2 This is almost exactly\nthe balance-of-risks calculus adopted by the Court, but\nunder the traditional approach necessity is an affirmative\ndefense. See, e.g., United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394,\n416 (1980). Necessity and the closely related defense of\nduress are affirmative defenses because they almost invar­\n——————\n  2 Traditionally, the defense of necessity was employed when natural\nforces created the situation justifying non-compliance; when the situa­\ntion was the product of human action, duress was the appropriate\ndefense. 2 LaFave §10.1(a), at 116. But “[m]odern cases have tended to\nblur the distinction between” these two defenses, United States v.\nBailey, 444 U. S. 394, 410 (1980), and “it would doubtless be possible to\ntreat [duress] as a branch of the law of necessity,” 2 LaFave §10.1(b), at\n121.\n4               ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\niably do not negate the mens rea necessary to incur crimi­\nnal liability. See 2 LaFave §10.1(a), at 118 (“The rationale\nof the necessity defense is not that a person, when faced\nwith the pressure of circumstances of nature, lacks the\nmental element which the crime in question requires”);\nid., §9.7(a), at 73 (same for duress).\n    This Court has made clear that, except in narrow cir­\ncumstances, necessity and duress do not negate the mens\nrea required for conviction. In Dixon v. United States, 548\nU. S. 1 (2006), the defendant was charged with “know-\ningly” and “willfully” committing certain criminal acts, but\nshe claimed that she committed the acts only because her\nboyfriend had threatened to kill her or hurt her daughters\nif she did not do so. Id., at 4. She contended that she\ncould not “have formed the necessary mens rea for these\ncrimes because she did not freely choose to commit the\nacts in question,” but we rejected that argument, explain­\ning that “[t]he duress defense, like the defense of necessity\n. . . , may excuse conduct that would otherwise be punish­\nable, but the existence of duress normally does not contro­\nvert any of the elements of the offense itself.” Id., at 6. In\na footnote, we suggested one situation in which the prose­\ncution might be required to disprove duress, namely,\nwhere a particular crime demands proof that the accused\nacted “maliciously,” which is to say “without justification\nor excuse.” Ibid., n. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n    The Court justifies its holding on the ground that the\nmens rea standard articulated in Nye & Nissen also falls\nwithin an exception to the general rule that proof of neces­\nsity or duress does not negate mens rea. Ante, at 16, n. 10.\nBut the Court, having refrained on pages 11–12 of its\nopinion from deciding whether aiding and abetting re­\nquires purposeful, as opposed to knowing, conduct, quickly\nand without explanation jettisons the “knowing” standard\nand concludes that purposeful conduct is needed. This is a\ncritical move because if it is enough for an alleged aider\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nand abettor simply to know that his confederate is carry­\ning a gun, then the alleged aider and abettor in the\nCourt’s hypothetical case (who spots the gun on the con­\nfederate’s person) unquestionably had the mens rea needed\nfor conviction.\n  But even accepting the Nye & Nissen standard as the\nexclusive means of proving the required mens rea, the\nCourt’s analysis is still quite wrong. Under the Nye &\nNissen standard, the Government must simply prove that\na defendant had as his conscious object that the hypothet­\nical drug sale (which, as the defendant knew, included the\ncarrying of a gun by one of the participants) go forward to\ncompletion. See Nye & Nissen, 336 U. S., at 619. Such\nintent is perfectly consistent with facts supporting a ne­\ncessity or duress defense. A person can certainly intend\nthe success of a criminal enterprise that he aids on the\nbelief that doing so will give rise to a lesser evil than his\nrefusal to participate would bring about.\n  The Court confuses two fundamentally distinct concepts:\nintent and motive. It seems to assume that, if a defend­\nant’s motive in aiding a criminal venture is to avoid some\ngreater evil, he does not have the intent that the venture\nsucceed. But the intent to undertake some act is of course\nperfectly consistent with the motive of avoiding adverse\nconsequences which would otherwise occur. We can all\ntestify to this from our daily experience. People wake up,\ngo to work, balance their checkbooks, shop for groceries—\nand yes, commit crimes—because they believe something\nbad will happen if they do not do these things, not because\nthe deepest desire of their heart is to do them. A person\nmay only go to work in the morning to keep his or her\nfamily from destitution; that does not mean he or she does\nnot intend to put in a full day’s work. In the same way,\nthe fact that a defendant carries out a crime because he\nfeels he must do so on pain of terrible consequences does\nnot mean he does not intend to carry out the crime. When\n6               ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nJean Valjean stole a loaf of bread to feed his starving\nfamily, he certainly intended to commit theft; the fact\nthat, had he been living in America today, he may have\npleaded necessity as a defense does not change that fact.\nSee V. Hugo, Les Misérables 54 (Fall River Press ed.\n2012).\n    Common-law commentators recognized this elementary\ndistinction between intent and motive. As Sir James\nFitzJames Stephen explains, if “A puts a loaded pistol to\nB’s temple and shoots B through the head deliberately,\n. . . . [i]t is obvious that in every such case the intention of\nA must be to kill B.” 2 A History of the Criminal Law of\nEngland 110–111 (1883). This fact “throws no light what­\never on A’s motives for killing B. They may have been\ninfinitely various. . . . The motive may have been a desire\nfor revenge, or a desire for plunder, or a wish on A’s part\nto defend himself against an attack by B, . . . or to put a\nman already mortally wounded out of his agony.” Id., at\n111. “In all these cases the intention is the same, but the\nmotives are different, and in all the intention may remain\nunchanged from first to last whilst the motives may vary\nfrom moment to moment.” Ibid.\n    Unsurprisingly, our cases have recognized that a lawful\nmotive (such as necessity, duress, or self-defense) is con­\nsistent with the mens rea necessary to satisfy a require­\nment of intent. In Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228 (1987),\nwe considered whether due process permitted the State of\nOhio to place the burden of proving self-defense on a de­\nfendant charged with aggravated murder. Under the Ohio\nstatute, aggravated murder consisted of “purposely, and\nwith prior calculation and design, caus[ing] the death of\nanother.” Id., at 230 (alteration in original; internal quo­\ntation marks omitted). Martin pleaded self-defense, which\nrequired her to prove that (1) she was “not at fault in\ncreating the situation giving rise to the argument” with\nthe victim, (2) she “had an honest belief that she was in\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nimminent danger of death or great bodily harm, and that\nher only means of escape from such danger was in the use\nof . . . force,” and (3) she “did not violate any duty to re­\ntreat or avoid danger.” Ibid. Martin argued that due\nprocess did not permit the State to impose the burden of\nproving self-defense on her, because proving self-defense\nwould necessarily negate the elements of aggravated\nmurder, which the State was required to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt. We disagreed, explaining that the\nelements which the State was required to prove to convict\nMartin were not the same as the elements which Martin\nwas required to prove to prevail on her self-defense theory.\nId., at 233. By so holding, we recognized that a defend­\nant’s purpose to kill another is not incompatible with that\ndefendant’s “honest belief that she was in imminent dan­\nger of death or great bodily harm” and that her use of force\nwas necessary to preserve her life. Id., at 230. In other\nwords, the fact that a defendant intends to kill another\nonly to avert mortal peril does not mean that the defend­\nant does not intend to kill.\n  That principle plays out in a wide variety of cases.\nUnited States v. Leal-Cruz, 431 F. 3d 667 (CA9 2005),\nprovides a good example. There, the Ninth Circuit had\nto decide whether a defendant could constitutionally be\nrequired to bear the burden of proving duress as a defense\nto conviction under 8 U. S. C. §1326 for attempted illegal\nreentry into the United States. Leal-Cruz pleaded duress,\ntestifying that he entered the United States only to escape\nthe deadly threat posed by abusive Mexican police officers\nwho were chasing him. 431 F. 3d, at 669. The Ninth\nCircuit had earlier held that the mens rea required for\nconviction for attempted illegal reentry was “purpose, i.e.,\nconscious desire, to reenter the United States.” Id., at\n671. The Court of Appeals nevertheless found that the\nConstitution permitted imposition of the burden of proving\nduress on Leal-Cruz, because proving duress did not re­\n8               ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nquire him to prove that he had not purposely entered the\nUnited States. As the Ninth Circuit explained, duress and\nthe mens rea requirement of intent did not overlap be­\ncause Leal-Cruz “had the ‘conscious desire’ to enter the\ncountry, even if the act of crossing the border was done to\nescape harm.” Id., at 673.\n   Thus, it seems inarguable to me that the existence of\nthe purpose or intent to carry out a crime is perfectly\ncompatible with facts giving rise to a necessity or duress\ndefense. Once that proposition is established, the Court’s\nerror is readily apparent. The Court requires the Gov­\nernment to prove that a defendant in Rosemond’s situa­\ntion could have walked away without risking harm greater\nthan he would cause by continuing with the crime—\ncircumstances that traditionally would support a necessity\nor duress defense. It imposes this requirement on the\nGovernment despite the fact that such dangerous circum­\nstances simply do not bear on whether the defendant\nintends the §924(c) offense to succeed, as (on the Court’s\nreading) is required for aiding and abetting liability.\n   The usual rule that a defendant bears the burden of\nproving affirmative defenses is justified by a compelling,\ncommonsense intuition: “[W]here the facts with regard to\nan issue lie peculiarly in the knowledge of a party, that\nparty is best situated to bear the burden of proof.” Smith\nv. United States, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6–7)\n(quoting Dixon, 548 U. S., at 9; alteration in original\nand internal quotation marks omitted). By abandoning\nthat rule in cases involving aiding and abetting of §924(c)\noffenses, the Court creates a perverse arrangement\nwhereby the prosecution must prove something that is\npeculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant. Imag­\nine that A aids B in committing a §924(c) offense and\nclaims that he only learned of the gun once the crime had\nbegun. If A had the burden of proof, he might testify that\nB was a hothead who had previously shot others who had\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ncrossed him. But under the Court’s rule, the prosecution,\nin order to show the intent needed to convict A as an aider\nand abettor, presumably has the burden of proving that B\nwas not such a person and that A did not believe him to\nbe. How is the prosecution to do this? By offering testi­\nmony by B’s friends and associates regarding his peaceful\nand easygoing nature? By introducing entries from A’s\ndiary in which he reflects on the sense of safety he feels\nwhen carrying out criminal enterprises in B’s company?\nFurthermore, even if B were a hothead and A knew him to\nbe such, A would presumably only be entitled to escape\nliability if he continued with the offense because of his fear\nof B’s reaction if he walked away. Under the Court’s rule,\nit is up to the Government to prove that A’s continued\nparticipation was not on account of his fear of B—but how?\nBy introducing footage of a convenient security camera\ndemonstrating that A’s eyes were not wide with fear, nor\nhis breathing rapid?\n   The Court’s rule breaks with the common-law tradition\nand our case law. It also makes no sense. I respectfully\ndissent from that portion of the Court’s opinion which\nplaces on the Government the burden of proving that the\nalleged aider and abettor of a §924(c) offense had what the\nCourt terms “a realistic opportunity” to refrain from en­\ngaging in the conduct at issue.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2655590/", "sha1": "433aff443c165fc2b4314f37f069332f1298b530", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-028", "time_retrieved": "2014-03-05T07:17:55.233319"}
