CASTLEMAN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12–1371. Argued January 15, 2014—Decided March 26, 2014\nRespondent Castleman moved to dismiss his indictment under 18\n  U. S. C. §922(g)(9), which forbids the possession of firearms by any-\n  one convicted of a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” He ar-\n  gued that his previous conviction for “intentionally or knowingly\n  caus[ing] bodily injury to” the mother of his child, App. 27, did not\n  qualify as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” because it did\n  not involve “the use or attempted use of physical force,” 18 U. S. C.\n  §921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The District Court agreed, reasoning that “physi-\n  cal force” must entail violent contact and that one can cause bodily\n  injury without violent contact, e.g., by poisoning. The Sixth Circuit\n  affirmed on a different rationale. It held that the degree of physical\n  force required for a conviction to constitute a “misdemeanor crime of\n  domestic violence” is the same as that required for a “violent felony”\n  under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), §924(e)(2)(B)(i)—\n  namely, violent force—and that Castleman could have been convicted\n  for causing slight injury by nonviolent conduct.\nHeld: Castleman’s conviction qualifies as a “misdemeanor crime of do-\n mestic violence.” Pp. 4–16.\n    (a) Section 922(g)(9)’s “physical force” requirement is satisfied by\n the degree of force that supports a common-law battery conviction—\n namely, offensive touching. Congress presumably intends to incorpo-\n rate the common-law meaning of terms that it uses, and nothing sug-\n gests Congress intended otherwise here. The Sixth Circuit relied up-\n on Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, in which the common-law\n meaning of “force” was found to be a “comical misfit,” id., at 145,\n when read into ACCA’s “violent felony” definition. But Johnson re-\n solves this case in the Government’s favor: The very reasons for re-\n jecting the common-law meaning in Johnson are reasons to embrace\n2                   UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    it here. First, whereas it was “unlikely” that Congress meant to in-\n    corporate in ACCA’s “violent felony” definition “a phrase that the\n    common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misde-\n    meanor,” id., at 141, it is likely that Congress meant to incorporate\n    the misdemeanor-specific meaning of “force” in defining a “misde-\n    meanor crime of domestic violence.” Second, whereas the word “vio-\n    lent” or “violence” standing alone “connotes a substantial degree of\n    force,” id., at 140, that is not true of “domestic violence,” which is a\n    term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as “vi-\n    olent” in a nondomestic context. Third, whereas this Court has hesi-\n    tated to apply ACCA to “crimes which, though dangerous, are not\n    typically committed by those whom one normally labels ‘armed career\n    criminals,’ ” Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137, 146, there is no\n    anomaly in grouping domestic abusers convicted of generic assault or\n    battery offenses together with others whom §922(g) disqualifies from\n    gun ownership. In addition, a contrary reading would have made\n    §922(g)(9) inoperative in at least ten States when it was enacted.\n    Pp. 4–10.\n       (b) Under this definition of “physical force,” Castleman’s conviction\n    qualifies as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” The appli-\n    cation of the modified categorical approach—consulting Castleman’s\n    state indictment to determine whether his conviction entailed the el-\n    ements necessary to constitute the generic federal offense—is\n    straightforward. Castleman pleaded guilty to “intentionally or know-\n    ingly caus[ing] bodily injury to” the mother of his child, and the\n    knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves\n    the use of physical force. First, a “bodily injury” must result from\n    “physical force.” The common-law concept of “force” encompasses\n    even its indirect application, making it impossible to cause bodily in-\n    jury without applying force in the common-law sense. Second, the\n    knowing or intentional application of force is a “use” of force. Leocal\n    v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, distinguished. Pp. 10–13.\n       (c) Castleman claims that legislative history, the rule of lenity, and\n    the canon of constitutional avoidance weigh against this Court’s in-\n    terpretation of §922(g)(9), but his arguments are unpersuasive.\n    Pp. 14–15.\n695 F. 3d 582, reversed and remanded.\n\n  SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

Hayes,\n555 U. S. 415, 427 (2009), Congress forbade the possession\nof firearms by anyone convicted of “a misdemeanor crime\nof domestic violence.” 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(9). The re-\nspondent, James Alvin Castleman, pleaded guilty to the\nmisdemeanor offense of having “intentionally or knowingly\ncause[d] bodily injury to” the mother of his child. App.\n27. The question before us is whether this conviction\nqualifies as “a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.”\nWe hold that it does.\n                           I\n\n                           A\n\n  This country witnesses more than a million acts of\ndomestic violence, and hundreds of deaths from domestic\nviolence, each year.1 See Georgia v.

CASTLEMAN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n103, 117–118 (2006). Domestic violence often escalates in\nseverity over time, see Brief for Major Cities Chiefs Asso-\nciation et al. as Amici Curiae 13–15; Brief for National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence et al. as Amici Curiae\n9–12, and the presence of a firearm increases the likeli-\nhood that it will escalate to homicide, see id., at 14–15;\nCampbell et al., Assessing Risk Factors for Intimate Part-\nner Homicide, DOJ, Nat. Institute of Justice J., No. 250,\np. 16 (Nov. 2003) (“When a gun was in the house, an\nabused woman was 6 times more likely than other abused\nwomen to be killed”). “[A]ll too often,” as one Senator\nnoted during the debate over §922(g)(9), “the only differ-\nence between a battered woman and a dead woman is the\npresence of a gun.” 142 Cong. Rec. 22986 (1996) (state-\nment of Sen.

App. 27. He\npleaded guilty. Id., at 29.\n  In 2008, federal authorities learned that Castleman was\nselling firearms on the black market. A grand jury in the\nWestern District of Tennessee indicted him on two counts\nof violating §922(g)(9) and on other charges not relevant\nhere. Id., at 13–16.\n  Castleman moved to dismiss the §922(g)(9) charges,\narguing that his Tennessee conviction did not qualify as a\n“misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” because it did\nnot “ha[ve], as an element, the use . . . of physical force,”\n§921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The District Court agreed, on the the-\nory that “the ‘use of physical force’ for §922(g)(9) purposes”\nmust entail “violent contact with the victim.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 40a. The court held that a conviction under the\nrelevant Tennessee statute cannot qualify as a “misde-\nmeanor crime of domestic violence” because one can cause\nbodily injury without “violent contact”—for example, by\n“deceiving [the victim] into drinking a poisoned beverage.”\nId., at 41a.\n  A divided panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\n4               UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nSixth Circuit affirmed, by different reasoning. 695 F. 3d\n582 (2012). The majority held that the degree of physical\nforce required by §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) is the same as required\nby §924(e)(2)(B)(i), which defines “violent felony.” Id., at\n587. Applying our decision in Johnson v. United States,\n559 U. S. 133 (2010), which held that §924(e)(2)(B)(i) re-\nquires “violent force,” id., at 140, the majority held that\nCastleman’s conviction did not qualify as a “misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence” because Castleman could have\nbeen convicted for “caus[ing] a slight, nonserious physical\ninjury with conduct that cannot be described as violent.”\n695 F. 3d, at 590. Judge McKeague dissented, arguing\nboth that the majority erred in extending Johnson’s defini-\ntion of a “violent felony” to the context of a “misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence” and that, in any event, Castle-\nman’s conviction satisfied the Johnson standard. Id., at\n593–597.\n   The Sixth Circuit’s decision deepened a split of author-\nity among the Courts of Appeals. Compare, e.g., United\nStates v. Nason, 269 F. 3d 10, 18 (CA1 2001) (§922(g)(9)\n“encompass[es] crimes characterized by the application of\nany physical force”), with United States v. Belless, 338\nF. 3d 1063, 1068 (CA9 2003) (§922(g)(9) covers only “the\nviolent use of force”). We granted certiorari to resolve this\nsplit, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), and now reverse the Sixth Cir-\ncuit’s judgment.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n  “It is a settled principle of interpretation that, absent\nother indication, ‘Congress intends to incorporate the well-\nsettled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.’ ” Sek-\nhar v. United States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3).\nSeeing no “other indication” here, we hold that Congress\nincorporated the common-law meaning of “force”—namely,\noffensive touching—in §921(a)(33)(A)’s definition of a “mis-\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndemeanor crime of domestic violence.”\n   Johnson resolves this case in the Government’s favor—\nnot, as the Sixth Circuit held, in Castleman’s. In Johnson,\nwe considered whether a battery conviction was a “violent\nfelony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n§924(e)(1). As here, ACCA defines such a crime as one\nthat “has as an element the use . . . of physical force,”\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i). We began by observing that at common\nlaw, the element of force in the crime of battery was “satis-\nfied by even the slightest offensive touching.” 559 U. S., at\n139 (citing 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 120 (1768)).2 And we recognized the general rule\nthat “a common-law term of art should be given its estab-\nlished common-law meaning,” except “where that meaning\ndoes not fit.” 559 U. S., at 139. We declined to read the\ncommon-law meaning of “force” into ACCA’s definition of a\n“violent felony,” because we found it a “comical misfit with\nthe defined term.” Id., at 145; see United States v. Ste-\nvens, 559 U. S. 460, 474 (2010) (“[A]n unclear definitional\nphrase may take meaning from the term to be defined”).\nIn defining a “ ‘violent felony,’ ” we held, “the phrase ‘physi-\ncal force’ ” must “mea[n] violent force.” Johnson, 559 U. S.,\nat 140. But here, the common-law meaning of “force” fits\nperfectly: The very reasons we gave for rejecting that\nmeaning in defining a “violent felony” are reasons to em-\nbrace it in defining a “misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.”3\n——————\n   2 We explained that the word “physical” did not add much to the word\n\n“force,” except to distinguish “force exerted by and through concrete\nbodies . . . from, for example, intellectual force or emotional force.”\nJohnson, 559 U. S., at 138.\n   3 Johnson specifically reserved the question whether our definition of\n\n“physical force” would extend to 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(9). 559 U. S., at\n143–144. And these reasons for declining to extend Johnson’s defini-\ntion to §922(g)(9) serve equally to rebut the “presumption of consistent\nusage” on which JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence heavily relies, post, at\n1–2, 4.\n6                 UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n    First, because perpetrators of domestic violence are\n“routinely prosecuted under generally applicable assault\nor battery laws,” Hayes, 555 U. S., at 427, it makes sense\nfor Congress to have classified as a “misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence” the type of conduct that supports a\ncommon-law battery conviction. Whereas it was “unlikely”\nthat Congress meant to incorporate in the definition of a\n“ ‘violent felony’ a phrase that the common law gave pecu-\nliar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor,”\nJohnson, 559 U. S., at 141, it is likely that Congress\nmeant to incorporate that misdemeanor-specific meaning\nof “force” in defining a “misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.”\n    Second, whereas the word “violent” or “violence” stand-\ning alone “connotes a substantial degree of force,” id., at\n140,4 that is not true of “domestic violence.” “Domestic\n——————\n  4 This portion of Johnson’s analysis relied heavily on Leocal v. Ash-\n\ncroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), in which we interpreted the meaning of a\n“crime of violence” under 18 U. S. C. §16. As in Johnson and here, the\nstatute defines a “crime of violence” in part as one “that has as an\nelement the use . . . of physical force,” §16(a). In support of our holding\nin Johnson, we quoted Leocal’s observation that “ ‘[t]he ordinary mean-\ning of [a “crime of violence”] . . . suggests a category of violent, active\ncrimes.’ ” 559 U. S., at 140 (quoting 543 U. S., at 11).\n  The Courts of Appeals have generally held that mere offensive\ntouching cannot constitute the “physical force” necessary to a “crime of\nviolence,” just as we held in Johnson that it could not constitute the\n“physical force” necessary to a “violent felony.” See Karimi v. Holder,\n715 F. 3d 561, 566–568 (CA4 2013); Singh v. Ashcroft, 386 F. 3d 1228,\n1233 (CA9 2004); Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003);\nUnited States v. Venegas-Ornelas, 348 F. 3d 1273, 1275 (CA10 2003);\nUnited States v. Landeros-Gonzales, 262 F. 3d 424, 426 (CA5 2001); see\nalso United States v. Rede-Mendez, 680 F. 3d 552, 558 (CA6 2012)\n(commenting generally that “[i]n the crime of violence context, ‘the\nphrase “physical force” means violent force’ ”); United States v. Hailese-\nlassie, 668 F. 3d 1033, 1035 (CA8 2012) (dicta). But see Hernandez v.\nU. S. Attorney General, 513 F. 3d 1336, 1340, n. 3 (CA11 2008) (per\ncuriam). The Board of Immigration Appeals has similarly extended\nJohnson’s requirement of violent force to the context of a “crime of\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nviolence” is not merely a type of “violence”; it is a term of\nart encompassing acts that one might not characterize as\n“violent” in a nondomestic context. See Brief for National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence et al. as Amici Curiae\n4–9; DOJ, Office on Violence Against Women, Domestic\nViolence (defining physical forms of domestic violence to\ninclude “[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching,\nbiting, [and] hair pulling”), online at http://www.ovw.\nusdoj.gov/domviolence.htm.5 Indeed, “most physical as-\nsaults committed against women and men by intimates\nare relatively minor and consist of pushing, grabbing,\nshoving, slapping, and hitting.” DOJ, P. Tjaden & N.\nThoennes, Extent, Nature and Consequences of Intimate\nPartner Violence 11 (2000).\n  Minor uses of force may not constitute “violence” in the\ngeneric sense. For example, in an opinion that we cited\n——————\nviolence” under §16. Matter of Velasquez, 25 I. & N. Dec. 278, 282\n(2010). Nothing in today’s opinion casts doubt on these holdings,\nbecause—as we explain—“domestic violence” encompasses a range of\nforce broader than that which constitutes “violence” simpliciter.\n  We note, as does JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence, post, at 8, and n. 7,\nthat federal law elsewhere defines “domestic violence” in more limited\nterms: For example, a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act\ndefines a “ ‘crime of domestic violence’ ” as “any crime of violence (as\ndefined by [18 U. S. C. §16])” committed against a qualifying relation. 8\nU. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E)(i). Our view that “domestic violence” encom-\npasses acts that might not constitute “violence” in a nondomestic\ncontext does not extend to a provision like this, which specifically\ndefines “domestic violence” by reference to a generic “crime of violence.”\n  5 See also    A.

McCue,\nDomestic Violence: A Reference Handbook 6 (1995) (noting that physi-\ncal forms of domestic violence “may begin with relatively minor as-\nsaults such as painful pinching or squeezing”).\n8                 UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwith approval in Johnson, the Seventh Circuit noted that\nit was “hard to describe . . . as ‘violence’ ” “a squeeze of the\narm [that] causes a bruise.” Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d\n666, 670 (2003). But an act of this nature is easy to de-\nscribe as “domestic violence,” when the accumulation of\nsuch acts over time can subject one intimate partner to the\nother’s control. If a seemingly minor act like this draws\nthe attention of authorities and leads to a successful pros-\necution for a misdemeanor offense, it does not offend\ncommon sense or the English language to characterize the\nresulting conviction as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.”\n   JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence discounts our reference to\nsocial-science definitions of “domestic violence,” including\nthose used by the organizations most directly engaged\nwith the problem and thus most aware of its dimensions.\nSee post, at 8–11. It is important to keep in mind, how-\never, that the operative phrase we are construing is not\n“domestic violence”; it is “physical force.” §921(a)(33)(A).\n“Physical force” has a presumptive common-law meaning,\nand the question is simply whether that presumptive\nmeaning makes sense in defining a “misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence.”6\n   A third reason for distinguishing Johnson’s definition of\n“physical force” is that unlike in Johnson—where a deter-\nmination that the defendant’s crime was a “violent felony”\nwould have classified him as an “armed career criminal”—\n\n——————\n  6 The concurrence’s reliance on definitions of “domestic violence” in\n\nother statutory provisions, see post, at 8, and n. 7, is similarly unper-\nsuasive. These other provisions show that when Congress wished to\ndefine “domestic violence” as a type of “violence” simpliciter, it knew\nhow to do so. That it did not do so here suggests, if anything, that it did\nnot mean to. See, e.g., Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485, 492\n(1994). This also answers the concurrence’s suggestion, post, at 10,\nthat our holding will somehow make it difficult for Congress to define\n“domestic violence”—where it wants to—as requiring violent force.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe statute here groups those convicted of “misdemeanor\ncrimes of domestic violence” with others whose conduct\ndoes not warrant such a designation. Section 922(g) bars\ngun possession by anyone “addicted to any controlled\nsubstance,” §922(g)(3); by most people who have “been\nadmitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant\nvisa,” §922(g)(5)(B); by anyone who has renounced United\nStates citizenship, §922(g)(7); and by anyone subject to a\ndomestic restraining order, §922(g)(8). Whereas we have\nhesitated (as in Johnson) to apply the Armed Career\nCriminal Act to “crimes which, though dangerous, are not\ntypically committed by those whom one normally labels\n‘armed career criminals,’ ” Begay v. United States, 553\nU. S. 137, 146 (2008), we see no anomaly in grouping\ndomestic abusers convicted of generic assault or battery\noffenses together with the others whom §922(g) disquali-\nfies from gun ownership.\n   An additional reason to read the statute as we do is that\na contrary reading would have rendered §922(g)(9) inoper-\native in many States at the time of its enactment. The\n“assault or battery laws” under which “domestic abusers\nwere . . . routinely prosecuted” when Congress enacted\n§922(g)(9), and under which many are still prosecuted\ntoday, Hayes, 555 U. S., at 427, fall generally into two\ncategories: those that prohibit both offensive touching and\nthe causation of bodily injury, and those that prohibit only\nthe latter. See Brief for United States 36–38. Whether or\nnot the causation of bodily injury necessarily entails vio-\nlent force—a question we do not reach—mere offensive\ntouching does not. See Johnson, 559 U. S., at 139–140. So\nif offensive touching did not constitute “force” under\n§921(a)(33)(A), then §922(g)(9) would have been ineffec-\ntual in at least 10 States—home to nearly thirty percent of\nthe Nation’s population7—at the time of its enactment.\n——————\n 7 See   U.

Hayes, 555\nU. S., at 427 (rejecting an interpretation under which\n“§922(g)(9) would have been ‘a dead letter’ in some two-\nthirds of the States from the very moment of its enact-\nment”).\n   In sum, Johnson requires that we attribute the com-\nmon-law meaning of “force” to §921(a)(33)(A)’s definition of\na “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” as an offense\nthat “has, as an element, the use or attempted use\nof physical force.” We therefore hold that the requirement\nof “physical force” is satisfied, for purposes of §922(g)(9),\nby the degree of force that supports a common-law battery\nconviction.\n                             B\n  Applying this definition of “physical force,” we conclude\nthat Castleman’s conviction qualifies as a “misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence.” In doing so, we follow the\nanalytic approach of Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575\n(1990), and Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13 (2005).\nWe begin with Taylor’s categorical approach, under which\nwe look to the statute of Castleman’s conviction to deter-\nmine whether that conviction necessarily “ha[d], as an\nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the\nthreatened use of a deadly weapon,” §921(a)(33)(A).\n  The Tennessee statute under which Castleman was\nconvicted made it a crime to “commi[t] an assault . . .\n——————\ntion Estimates: April 1, 1990 to April 1, 2000, online at http://www.cen-\nsus.gov/popest/data/intercensal/st-co/files/CO-EST2001-12-00.pdf (esti-\nmating state and national populations as of July 1, 1996).\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

A threat under §39–13–101(2) may\nnot necessarily involve a deadly weapon, and the merely\nreckless causation of bodily injury under §39–13–101(1)\nmay not be a “use” of force.8\n   But we need not decide whether a domestic assault\nconviction in Tennessee categorically constitutes a “mis-\ndemeanor crime of domestic violence,” because the parties\n——————\n  8 We  held in Leocal that “ ‘use’ requires active employment,” rather\n“than negligent or merely accidental conduct.” 543 U.

CASTLEMAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndo not contest that §39–13–101 is a “ ‘divisible statute,’ ”\nDescamps v. United States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op.,\nat 1). We may accordingly apply the modified categorical\napproach, consulting the indictment to which Castleman\npleaded guilty in order to determine whether his convic-\ntion did entail the elements necessary to constitute the\ngeneric federal offense. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1–2); see\nShepard, 544 U. S., at 26. Here, that analysis is straight-\nforward: Castleman pleaded guilty to having “intentionally\nor knowingly cause[d] bodily injury” to the mother of his\nchild, App. 27, and the knowing or intentional causation of\nbodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force.\n   First, a “bodily injury” must result from “physical force.”\nUnder Tennessee law, “bodily injury” is a broad term: It\n“includes a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn or disfigurement;\nphysical pain or temporary illness or impairment of the\nfunction of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.”\nTenn. Code Ann. §39–11–106(a)(2) (1997). JUSTICE SCA-\nLIA’s concurrence suggests that these forms of injury ne-\ncessitate violent force, under Johnson’s definition of that\nphrase. Post, at 3. But whether or not that is so—a\nquestion we do not decide—these forms of injury do neces-\nsitate force in the common-law sense.\n   The District Court thought otherwise, reasoning that\none can cause bodily injury “without the ‘use of physical\nforce’ ”—for example, by “deceiving [the victim] into drink-\ning a poisoned beverage, without making contact of any\nkind.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a. But as we explained in\nJohnson, “physical force” is simply “force exerted by and\nthrough concrete bodies,” as opposed to “intellectual force\nor emotional force.” 559 U. S., at 138. And the common-\nlaw concept of “force” encompasses even its indirect ap-\nplication. “Force” in this sense “describ[es] one of the\nelements of the common-law crime of battery,” id., at 139,\nand “[t]he force used” in battery “need not be applied\ndirectly to the body of the victim.” 2 W.

It is impossible to cause\nbodily injury without applying force in the common-law\nsense.\n   Second, the knowing or intentional application of force\nis a “use” of force. Castleman is correct that under Leocal\nv. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), the word “use” “conveys the\nidea that the thing used (here, ‘physical force’) has been\nmade the user’s instrument.” Brief for Respondent 37.\nBut he errs in arguing that although “[p]oison may have\n‘forceful physical properties’ as a matter of organic chemis-\ntry, . . . no one would say that a poisoner ‘employs’ force or\n‘carries out a purpose by means of force’ when he or\nshe sprinkles poison in a victim’s drink,” ibid. The “use\nof force” in Castleman’s example is not the act of\n“sprinkl[ing]” the poison; it is the act of employing poison\nknowingly as a device to cause physical harm. That the\nharm occurs indirectly, rather than directly (as with a kick\nor punch), does not matter. Under Castleman’s logic, after\nall, one could say that pulling the trigger on a gun is not a\n“use of force” because it is the bullet, not the trigger, that\nactually strikes the victim. Leocal held that the “use” of\nforce must entail “a higher degree of intent than negligent\nor merely accidental conduct,” 543 U. S., at 9; it did not\nhold that the word “use” somehow alters the meaning of\n“force.”\n   Because Castleman’s indictment makes clear that the\nuse of physical force was an element of his conviction, that\nconviction qualifies as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.”\n14            UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                           III\n We are not persuaded by Castleman’s nontextual argu-\nments against our interpretation of §922(g)(9).\n                              A\n  First, Castleman invokes §922(g)(9)’s legislative history\nto suggest that Congress could not have intended for the\nprovision to apply to acts involving minimal force. But to\nthe extent that legislative history can aid in the inter-\npretation of this statute, Castleman’s reliance on it is\nunpersuasive.\n  Castleman begins by observing that during the debate\nover §922(g)(9), several Senators argued that the provision\nwould help to prevent gun violence by perpetrators of\nsevere domestic abuse. Senator Lautenberg referred to\n“serious spousal or child abuse” and to “violent individu-\nals”; Senator Hutchison to “ ‘people who batter their\nwives’ ”; Senator Wellstone to people who “brutalize” their\nwives or children; and Senator Feinstein to “severe and\nrecurring domestic violence.” 142 Cong. Rec. 22985–\n22986, 22988. But as we noted above, see supra, at 2, the\nimpetus of §922(g)(9) was that even perpetrators of severe\ndomestic violence are often convicted “under generally\napplicable assault or battery laws.” Hayes, 555 U. S., at\n427. So nothing about these Senators’ isolated references\nto severe domestic violence suggests that they would not\nhave wanted §922(g)(9) to apply to a misdemeanor assault\nconviction like Castleman’s.\n  Castleman next observes that §922(g)(9) is the product\nof a legislative compromise. The provision originally\nbarred gun possession for any “crime of domestic violence,”\ndefined as any “felony or misdemeanor crime of violence,\nregardless of length, term, or manner of punishment.” 142\nCong. Rec. 5840. Congress rewrote the provision to re-\nquire the use of physical force in response to the concern\n“that the term crime of violence was too broad, and could\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbe interpreted to include an act such as cutting up a credit\ncard with a pair of scissors,” id., at 26675. See Hayes, 555\nU. S., at 428. Castleman would have us conclude that\nCongress thus meant “to narrow the scope of the statute to\nconvictions based on especially severe conduct.” Brief for\nRespondent 24. But all Congress meant to do was address\nthe fear that §922(g)(9) might be triggered by offenses in\nwhich no force at all was directed at a person. As Senator\nLautenberg noted, the revised text was not only “more\nprecise” than the original but also “probably broader.” 142\nCong. Rec. 26675.\n                            B\n   We are similarly unmoved by Castleman’s invocation of\nthe rule of lenity. Castleman is correct that our “construc-\ntion of a criminal statute must be guided by the need for\nfair warning.” Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152,\n160 (1990). But “the rule of lenity only applies if, after\nconsidering text, structure, history, and purpose, there\nremains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the stat-\nute, such that the Court must simply guess as to what\nCongress intended.” Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S. 474, 488\n(2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nThat is not the case here.\n                              C\n  Finally, Castleman suggests—in a single paragraph—\nthat we should read §922(g)(9) narrowly because it impli-\ncates his constitutional right to keep and bear arms. But\nCastleman has not challenged the constitutionality of\n§922(g)(9), either on its face or as applied to him, and the\nmeaning of the statute is sufficiently clear that we need\nnot indulge Castleman’s cursory nod to constitutional\navoidance concerns.\n                     *    *   *\n  Castleman’s conviction for having “intentionally or\n16             UNITED STATES v.

S. C.\n§ §921(a)(33)(A)(ii), and thus constitutes a “misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence,” §922(g)(9). I write separately,\nhowever, because I reach that conclusion on narrower\ngrounds.\n                               I\n  Our decision in Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133\n(2010), is the natural place to begin. Johnson is signifi-\ncant here because it concluded that “the phrase ‘physical\nforce’ means violent force—that is, force capable of caus-\ning physical pain or injury to another person.” Id., at\n140 (second emphasis added). This is an easy case if\nthe phrase “physical force” has the same meaning in\n§921(a)(33)(A)(ii), the provision that defines “misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence” for purposes of §922(g)(9), as it\ndoes in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), the provision interpreted in John-\nson, since it is impossible to cause bodily injury without\nusing force “capable of ” producing that result.\n  There are good reasons to give the phrase Johnson’s\ninterpretation. One is the presumption of consistent\n2              UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nusage—the rule of thumb that a term generally means the\nsame thing each time it is used. Although the presump-\ntion is most commonly applied to terms appearing in the\nsame enactment, e.g., IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21,\n33–34 (2005), it is equally relevant “when Congress uses the\nsame language in two statutes having similar purposes,”\nSmith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228, 233 (2005)\n(plurality opinion); see also Northcross v. Board of Ed. of\nMemphis City Schools, 412 U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per\ncuriam). This case is a textbook candidate for application\nof the Smith-Northcross branch of the rule. The “physical\nforce” clauses at issue here and in Johnson are worded in\nnearly identical fashion: The former defines a “misde-\nmeanor crime of domestic violence” as an offense that\n“has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical\nforce,” §921(a)(33)(A)(ii), while the latter defines a “violent\nfelony” as an offense that “has as an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against\nthe person of another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i). And both statutes\nare designed to promote public safety by deterring a class\nof criminals from possessing firearms.\n   Respondent’s arguments fail to overcome the presump-\ntion of consistent usage. In respondent’s view, “physical\nforce” cannot mean “any force that produces any pain\nor bodily injury,” Brief for Respondent 25, because\n§921(a)(33)(A)(ii) defines a violent crime and one can in-\nflict all sorts of minor injuries—bruises, paper cuts,\netc.—by engaging in nonviolent behavior. Respondent\ntherefore reasons that §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) requires force capa-\nble of inflicting “serious” bodily injury. That requirement\nis more demanding than both of the plausible mean-\nings of “physical force” we identified in Johnson: common-\nlaw offensive touching (which Johnson rejected) and force\ncapable of causing physical pain or injury, serious or\notherwise. See 559 U. S., at 138–140. It would be surpas-\nsing strange to read a statute defining a “misdemeanor\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

The rest of\nthe analysis is straightforward. Because “intentionally or\nknowingly caus[ing] bodily injury,” App. 27, categorically\ninvolves the use of “force capable of causing physical pain\nor injury to another person,” 559 U. S., at 140, respond-\nent’s 2001 domestic-assault conviction qualifies as a “mis-\ndemeanor crime of domestic violence” under §922(g)(9).1\nI would reverse the judgment below on that basis and\nremand for further proceedings.\n                             II\n   Unfortunately, the Court bypasses that narrower inter-\npretation of §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) in favor of a much broader\none that treats any offensive touching, no matter how\nslight, as sufficient. That expansive common-law defini-\ntion cannot be squared with relevant precedent or statu-\ntory text.\n   We have twice addressed the meaning of “physical force”\nin the context of provisions that define a class of violent\ncrimes. Both times, we concluded that “physical force”\nmeans violent force. In Johnson, we thought it “clear that\nin the context of a statutory definition of ‘violent felony,’\nthe phrase ‘physical force’ means violent force.” Id., at\n140. And we held that common-law offensive touching—\nthe same type of force the Court today holds does consti-\ntute “physical force”—is not sufficiently violent to satisfy\n——————\n  1 Respondent argues at length that Tenn. Code Ann. §39–13–111(b)\n\n(2013 Supp.) does not require the “use” of physical force, since it is\npossible to cause bodily injury through deceit or other nonviolent\nmeans.

S. 1, 11 (2004), we observed\nthat §16(a)—which defines a “crime of violence” as “an\noffense that has as an element the use, attempted use,\nor threatened use of physical force against the person or\nproperty of another”—comprehends “a category of vio-\nlent, active crimes.” The textual similarity between\n§921(a)(33)(A)(ii)’s “physical force” clause and the clauses\nat issue in Johnson and Leocal thus raises the question:\nWhy should the same meaning not apply here?\n   The Court gives four responses that merit discussion,\nnone of which withstands scrutiny. First, the Court in-\nvokes the “ ‘settled principle of interpretation that, absent\nother indication, “Congress intends to incorporate the\nwell-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.” ’ ”\nAnte, at 4 (quoting Sekhar v. United States, 570 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 3)). That principle is of limited\nrelevance, since the presumption of consistent statutory\nmeaning is precisely “other indication” that §921(a)(33)\n(A)(ii) does not incorporate the common-law meaning.\nAnyway, a more accurate formulation of the principle\ncited by the Court is that when “ ‘a word is obviously\ntransplanted from another legal source, whether the\ncommon law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with\nit.’ ” Sekhar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3–4) (quoting\nFrankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes,\n47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947); emphasis added).\nSection 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) was enacted after the statutes\ninvolved in Johnson and Leocal,2 and its “physical force”\n——————\n  2 Section §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) was enacted in 1996. See §658, 110 Stat.\n\n3009–371. The Armed Career Criminal Act provision interpreted in\nJohnson was enacted in 1986, see §1402, 100 Stat. 3207–39, and the\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nclause is quite obviously modeled on theirs.\n  Second, the Court asserts that any interpretation of\n“physical force” that excludes offensive touching “would\nhave rendered §922(g)(9) inoperative in many States at\nthe time of its enactment.” Ante, at 9. But there is no\ninterpretive principle to the effect that statutes must be\ngiven their broadest possible application, and §922(g)(9)\nwithout offensive touching would have had application in\nfour-fifths of the States. Although domestic violence was\n“routinely prosecuted” under misdemeanor assault or bat-\ntery statutes when Congress enacted §922(g)(9), United\nStates v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 427 (2009), and such stat-\nutes generally prohibited “both offensive touching and the\ncausation of bodily injury” or “only the latter,” ante, at 9, it\ndoes not follow that interpreting “physical force” to mean\nviolent force would have rendered §922(g)(9) a practical\nnullity. To the contrary, §922(g)(9) would have worked\nperfectly well in 38 of the 48 States that had misdemeanor\nassault or battery statutes at the time of §922(g)(9)’s\nenactment. At that point, 19 States had statutes that\ncovered infliction of bodily injury but not offensive touch-\ning,3 and 19 more had statutes that prohibited both of\ntypes of conduct, but did so in a divisible manner—thus\n——————\n“crime of violence” statute discussed in Leocal was enacted in 1984, see\n§1001, 98 Stat. 2136.\n  3 See Ala.

CASTLEMAN\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nmaking it possible to identify the basis for a conviction by\ninspecting charging documents and similar materials, see\nDescamps v. United States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip\nop., at 5–8).4 That leaves only 10 States whose misde-\nmeanor assault or battery statutes (1) prohibited offensive\ntouching, and (2) were framed in such a way that offensive\ntouching was indivisible from physical violence.5 The fact\nthat §922(g)(9) would not have applied immediately in 10\nStates is hardly enough to trigger the presumption against\nineffectiveness—the idea that Congress presumably does\nnot enact useless laws. Compare Hayes, supra, at 427\n(rejecting an interpretation that supposedly would have\nrendered §922(g)(9) “ ‘a dead letter’ in some two-thirds of\nthe States”). I think it far more plausible that Congress\nenacted a statute that covered domestic-violence convic-\ntions in four-fifths of the States, and left it to the handful\nof nonconforming States to change their laws (as some\nhave), than that Congress adopted a meaning of “domestic\nviolence” that included the slightest unwanted touching.\n——————\n  4 See Ariz.

We properly take\naccount of the term being defined when interpreting “an\nunclear definitional phrase.” United States v. Stevens, 559\nU. S. 460, 474 (2010); but see Babbitt v. Sweet Home\nChapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 717–\n719 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But when we do so, we\nconsider the entire term being defined, not just part of it.\nHere, the term being defined is “misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence.” Applying the term-to-be-defined canon\nthus yields the unremarkable conclusion that “physical\nforce” in §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) refers to the type of force in-\nvolved in violent misdemeanors (such as bodily-injury\noffenses) rather than nonviolent ones (such as offensive\ntouching).\n   Fourth, and finally, the Court seeks to evade Johnson\nand Leocal on the ground that “ ‘domestic violence’ encom-\npasses a range of force broader than that which con-\nstitutes ‘violence’ simpliciter.” Ante, at 6, n. 4. That is\nto say, an act need not be violent to qualify as “domestic\nviolence.” That absurdity is not only at war with the\nEnglish language, it is flatly inconsistent with defini-\ntions of “domestic violence” from the period surrounding\n§921(a)(33)(A)(ii)’s enactment. At the time, dictionaries\ndefined “domestic violence” as, for instance, “[v]iolence\nbetween members of a household, usu. spouses; an assault\nor other violent act committed by one member of a house-\nhold against another,” Black’s Law Dictionary 1564 (7th\ned. 1999), and “[v]iolence toward or physical abuse of one’s\nspouse or domestic partner,” American Heritage Diction-\nary 534 (4th ed. 2000).6 Those definitions, combined with\n——————\n 6 Definitions   of “physical force” from the same period are also at odds\n8                 UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe absence of “domestic violence” entries in earlier dic-\ntionaries, see, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 484 (6th ed.\n1990); American Heritage Dictionary 550 (3d ed. 1992),\nmake it utterly implausible that Congress adopted a “term\nof art” definition “encompassing acts that one might not\ncharacterize as ‘violent’ in a nondomestic context,” ante,\nat 7.\n   The Court’s inventive, nonviolent definition fares no\nbetter when judged against other accepted sources of\nmeaning. Current dictionaries give “domestic violence”\nthe same meaning as above: ordinary violence that occurs\nin a domestic context. See, e.g., American Heritage Dic-\ntionary 533 (5th ed. 2011) (“[p]hysical abuse of a house-\nhold member, especially one’s spouse or domestic partner”).\nThe same goes for definitions of “domestic violence”\nfound in other federal statutes.7 Indeed, Congress defined\n“crime of domestic violence” as a “crime of violence” in\nanother section of the same bill that enacted §921(a)\n(33)(A)(ii). See §350(a), 110 Stat. 3009–639, codified at\n8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E)(i).\n   The Court ignores these authorities and instead bases\nits definition on an amicus brief filed by the National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence and other private\n\n——————\nwith the Court’s nonviolent interpretation of that phrase. See Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 656 (7th ed. 1999) (“[f]orce consisting in a physical act,\nesp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim”); id., at 1147 (6th\ned. 1990) (“[f]orce applied to the body; actual violence”).\n   7 See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §2261(a)(1) (defining as “[i]nterstate domestic\n\nviolence” certain “crime[s] of violence”); §3561(b) (“The term ‘domestic\nviolence crime’ means a crime of violence . . . in which the victim or\nintended victim is the [defendant’s] spouse” or other qualifying rela-\ntion); 25 U. S. C. A. §1304(a)(2) (“The term ‘domestic violence’ means\nviolence committed by a current or former spouse or” other qualifying\nrelation); 42 U. S. C.

For example, amici’s\ndefinitions describe as “domestic violence” acts that “hu-\nmiliate, isolate, frighten, . . . [and] blame . . . someone”;\n“acts of omission”; “excessive monitoring of a woman’s\nbehavior, repeated accusations of infidelity, and control-\nling with whom she has contact.” Brief for National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence et al. as Amici Curiae\n5–8, and nn. 7, 11. The offerings of the Department\nof Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women are\nequally capacious and (to put it mildly) unconventional.\nIts publications define “domestic violence” as “a pattern\nof abusive behavior . . . used by one partner to gain\nor maintain power and control over another,” including\n“[u]ndermining an individual’s sense of self-worth,”\n“name-calling,” and “damaging one’s relationship with\nhis or her children.” See, e.g., Domestic Violence, online\nat http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/domviolence.htm (all Internet\nmaterials as visited Mar. 21, 2014, and available in the\nClerk of Court’s case file).9\n——————\n  8 The  other organizations on the brief are the National Domestic\nViolence Hotline, the Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and\nAppeals Project, Legal Momentum, and innumerable state organiza-\ntions against domestic violence.\n   9 The Court refers in a footnote to two additional social-science defini-\n\ntions, neither of which aids the Court’s cause. See ante, at 7, n. 5. The\nfirst is drawn from a health-care manual that provides “a behavioral\ndefinition of domestic violence . . . rather than a legal definition, since a\n10                UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   Of course these private organizations and the Depart-\nment of Justice’s (nonprosecuting) Office are entitled to\ndefine “domestic violence” any way they want for their\nown purposes—purposes that can include (quite literally)\ngiving all domestic behavior harmful to women a bad\nname. (What is more abhorrent than violence against\nwomen?) But when they (and the Court) impose their all-\nembracing definition on the rest of us, they not only\ndistort the law, they impoverish the language. When\neverything is domestic violence, nothing is. Congress will\nhave to come up with a new word (I cannot imagine what\nit would be) to denote actual domestic violence.\n   Although the Justice Department’s definitions ought to\nbe deemed unreliable in toto on the basis of their extrava-\ngant extensions alone (falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus),\nthe Court chooses to focus only upon the physical actions\nthat they include, viz., “[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grab-\nbing, pinching, biting, [and] hair pulling.” Ibid. None of\nthose actions bears any real resemblance to mere offensive\ntouching, and all of them are capable of causing physical\npain or injury. Cf. Johnson, 559 U. S., at 143 (identifying\n“a slap in the face” as conduct that might rise to the level\nof violent force). And in any event, the Department of\nJustice thankfully receives no deference in our interpreta-\n——————\nbehavioral definition is more comprehensive and more relevant to the\nhealth care setting.” A.

Here, of course, we are concerned\nwith the less comprehensive legal definition. The second definition\nreferred to in the footnote equates domestic violence with “overt vio-\nlence,” which in its least serious form consists of “painful pinching or\nsqueezing.” M. McCue, Domestic Violence: A Reference Handbook 6\n(1995) (emphasis added). That meaning is consistent with Johnson’s\ndefinition of “physical force,” but it plainly does not include harmless\noffensive touching.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

CASTLEMAN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12–1371. Argued January 15, 2014—Decided March 26, 2014\nRespondent Castleman moved to dismiss his indictment under 18\n  U. S. C. §922(g)(9), which forbids the possession of firearms by any-\n  one convicted of a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” He ar-\n  gued that his previous conviction for “intentionally or knowingly\n  caus[ing] bodily injury to” the mother of his child, App. 27, did not\n  qualify as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” because it did\n  not involve “the use or attempted use of physical force,” 18 U. S. C.\n  §921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The District Court agreed, reasoning that “physi-\n  cal force” must entail violent contact and that one can cause bodily\n  injury without violent contact, e.g., by poisoning. The Sixth Circuit\n  affirmed on a different rationale. It held that the degree of physical\n  force required for a conviction to constitute a “misdemeanor crime of\n  domestic violence” is the same as that required for a “violent felony”\n  under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), §924(e)(2)(B)(i)—\n  namely, violent force—and that Castleman could have been convicted\n  for causing slight injury by nonviolent conduct.\nHeld: Castleman’s conviction qualifies as a “misdemeanor crime of do-\n mestic violence.” Pp. 4–16.\n    (a) Section 922(g)(9)’s “physical force” requirement is satisfied by\n the degree of force that supports a common-law battery conviction—\n namely, offensive touching. Congress presumably intends to incorpo-\n rate the common-law meaning of terms that it uses, and nothing sug-\n gests Congress intended otherwise here. The Sixth Circuit relied up-\n on Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, in which the common-law\n meaning of “force” was found to be a “comical misfit,” id., at 145,\n when read into ACCA’s “violent felony” definition. But Johnson re-\n solves this case in the Government’s favor: The very reasons for re-\n jecting the common-law meaning in Johnson are reasons to embrace\n2                   UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    it here. First, whereas it was “unlikely” that Congress meant to in-\n    corporate in ACCA’s “violent felony” definition “a phrase that the\n    common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misde-\n    meanor,” id., at 141, it is likely that Congress meant to incorporate\n    the misdemeanor-specific meaning of “force” in defining a “misde-\n    meanor crime of domestic violence.” Second, whereas the word “vio-\n    lent” or “violence” standing alone “connotes a substantial degree of\n    force,” id., at 140, that is not true of “domestic violence,” which is a\n    term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as “vi-\n    olent” in a nondomestic context. Third, whereas this Court has hesi-\n    tated to apply ACCA to “crimes which, though dangerous, are not\n    typically committed by those whom one normally labels ‘armed career\n    criminals,’ ” Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137, 146, there is no\n    anomaly in grouping domestic abusers convicted of generic assault or\n    battery offenses together with others whom §922(g) disqualifies from\n    gun ownership. In addition, a contrary reading would have made\n    §922(g)(9) inoperative in at least ten States when it was enacted.\n    Pp. 4–10.\n       (b) Under this definition of “physical force,” Castleman’s conviction\n    qualifies as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” The appli-\n    cation of the modified categorical approach—consulting Castleman’s\n    state indictment to determine whether his conviction entailed the el-\n    ements necessary to constitute the generic federal offense—is\n    straightforward. Castleman pleaded guilty to “intentionally or know-\n    ingly caus[ing] bodily injury to” the mother of his child, and the\n    knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves\n    the use of physical force. First, a “bodily injury” must result from\n    “physical force.” The common-law concept of “force” encompasses\n    even its indirect application, making it impossible to cause bodily in-\n    jury without applying force in the common-law sense. Second, the\n    knowing or intentional application of force is a “use” of force. Leocal\n    v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, distinguished. Pp. 10–13.\n       (c) Castleman claims that legislative history, the rule of lenity, and\n    the canon of constitutional avoidance weigh against this Court’s in-\n    terpretation of §922(g)(9), but his arguments are unpersuasive.\n    Pp. 14–15.\n695 F. 3d 582, reversed and remanded.\n\n  SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

App. 27. He\npleaded guilty. Id., at 29.\n  In 2008, federal authorities learned that Castleman was\nselling firearms on the black market. A grand jury in the\nWestern District of Tennessee indicted him on two counts\nof violating §922(g)(9) and on other charges not relevant\nhere. Id., at 13–16.\n  Castleman moved to dismiss the §922(g)(9) charges,\narguing that his Tennessee conviction did not qualify as a\n“misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” because it did\nnot “ha[ve], as an element, the use . . . of physical force,”\n§921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The District Court agreed, on the the-\nory that “the ‘use of physical force’ for §922(g)(9) purposes”\nmust entail “violent contact with the victim.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 40a. The court held that a conviction under the\nrelevant Tennessee statute cannot qualify as a “misde-\nmeanor crime of domestic violence” because one can cause\nbodily injury without “violent contact”—for example, by\n“deceiving [the victim] into drinking a poisoned beverage.”\nId., at 41a.\n  A divided panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\n4               UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nSixth Circuit affirmed, by different reasoning. 695 F. 3d\n582 (2012). The majority held that the degree of physical\nforce required by §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) is the same as required\nby §924(e)(2)(B)(i), which defines “violent felony.” Id., at\n587. Applying our decision in Johnson v. United States,\n559 U. S. 133 (2010), which held that §924(e)(2)(B)(i) re-\nquires “violent force,” id., at 140, the majority held that\nCastleman’s conviction did not qualify as a “misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence” because Castleman could have\nbeen convicted for “caus[ing] a slight, nonserious physical\ninjury with conduct that cannot be described as violent.”\n695 F. 3d, at 590. Judge McKeague dissented, arguing\nboth that the majority erred in extending Johnson’s defini-\ntion of a “violent felony” to the context of a “misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence” and that, in any event, Castle-\nman’s conviction satisfied the Johnson standard. Id., at\n593–597.\n   The Sixth Circuit’s decision deepened a split of author-\nity among the Courts of Appeals. Compare, e.g., United\nStates v. Nason, 269 F. 3d 10, 18 (CA1 2001) (§922(g)(9)\n“encompass[es] crimes characterized by the application of\nany physical force”), with United States v. Belless, 338\nF. 3d 1063, 1068 (CA9 2003) (§922(g)(9) covers only “the\nviolent use of force”). We granted certiorari to resolve this\nsplit, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), and now reverse the Sixth Cir-\ncuit’s judgment.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n  “It is a settled principle of interpretation that, absent\nother indication, ‘Congress intends to incorporate the well-\nsettled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.’ ” Sek-\nhar v. United States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3).\nSeeing no “other indication” here, we hold that Congress\nincorporated the common-law meaning of “force”—namely,\noffensive touching—in §921(a)(33)(A)’s definition of a “mis-\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

In Johnson,\nwe considered whether a battery conviction was a “violent\nfelony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n§924(e)(1). As here, ACCA defines such a crime as one\nthat “has as an element the use . . . of physical force,”\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i). We began by observing that at common\nlaw, the element of force in the crime of battery was “satis-\nfied by even the slightest offensive touching.” 559 U. S., at\n139 (citing 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 120 (1768)).2 And we recognized the general rule\nthat “a common-law term of art should be given its estab-\nlished common-law meaning,” except “where that meaning\ndoes not fit.” 559 U. S., at 139. We declined to read the\ncommon-law meaning of “force” into ACCA’s definition of a\n“violent felony,” because we found it a “comical misfit with\nthe defined term.” Id., at 145; see United States v. Ste-\nvens, 559 U. S. 460, 474 (2010) (“[A]n unclear definitional\nphrase may take meaning from the term to be defined”).\nIn defining a “ ‘violent felony,’ ” we held, “the phrase ‘physi-\ncal force’ ” must “mea[n] violent force.” Johnson, 559 U. S.,\nat 140. But here, the common-law meaning of “force” fits\nperfectly: The very reasons we gave for rejecting that\nmeaning in defining a “violent felony” are reasons to em-\nbrace it in defining a “misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.”3\n——————\n   2 We explained that the word “physical” did not add much to the word\n\n“force,” except to distinguish “force exerted by and through concrete\nbodies . . . from, for example, intellectual force or emotional force.”\nJohnson, 559 U. S., at 138.\n   3 Johnson specifically reserved the question whether our definition of\n\n“physical force” would extend to 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(9). 559 U. S., at\n143–144. And these reasons for declining to extend Johnson’s defini-\ntion to §922(g)(9) serve equally to rebut the “presumption of consistent\nusage” on which JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence heavily relies, post, at\n1–2, 4.\n6                 UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n    First, because perpetrators of domestic violence are\n“routinely prosecuted under generally applicable assault\nor battery laws,” Hayes, 555 U. S., at 427, it makes sense\nfor Congress to have classified as a “misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence” the type of conduct that supports a\ncommon-law battery conviction. Whereas it was “unlikely”\nthat Congress meant to incorporate in the definition of a\n“ ‘violent felony’ a phrase that the common law gave pecu-\nliar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor,”\nJohnson, 559 U. S., at 141, it is likely that Congress\nmeant to incorporate that misdemeanor-specific meaning\nof “force” in defining a “misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.”\n    Second, whereas the word “violent” or “violence” stand-\ning alone “connotes a substantial degree of force,” id., at\n140,4 that is not true of “domestic violence.” “Domestic\n——————\n  4 This portion of Johnson’s analysis relied heavily on Leocal v. Ash-\n\ncroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), in which we interpreted the meaning of a\n“crime of violence” under 18 U. S. C. §16. As in Johnson and here, the\nstatute defines a “crime of violence” in part as one “that has as an\nelement the use . . . of physical force,” §16(a). In support of our holding\nin Johnson, we quoted Leocal’s observation that “ ‘[t]he ordinary mean-\ning of [a “crime of violence”] . . . suggests a category of violent, active\ncrimes.’ ” 559 U. S., at 140 (quoting 543 U. S., at 11).\n  The Courts of Appeals have generally held that mere offensive\ntouching cannot constitute the “physical force” necessary to a “crime of\nviolence,” just as we held in Johnson that it could not constitute the\n“physical force” necessary to a “violent felony.” See Karimi v. Holder,\n715 F. 3d 561, 566–568 (CA4 2013); Singh v. Ashcroft, 386 F. 3d 1228,\n1233 (CA9 2004); Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003);\nUnited States v. Venegas-Ornelas, 348 F. 3d 1273, 1275 (CA10 2003);\nUnited States v. Landeros-Gonzales, 262 F. 3d 424, 426 (CA5 2001); see\nalso United States v. Rede-Mendez, 680 F. 3d 552, 558 (CA6 2012)\n(commenting generally that “[i]n the crime of violence context, ‘the\nphrase “physical force” means violent force’ ”); United States v. Hailese-\nlassie, 668 F. 3d 1033, 1035 (CA8 2012) (dicta). But see Hernandez v.\nU. S. Attorney General, 513 F. 3d 1336, 1340, n. 3 (CA11 2008) (per\ncuriam).

See Brief for National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence et al. as Amici Curiae\n4–9; DOJ, Office on Violence Against Women, Domestic\nViolence (defining physical forms of domestic violence to\ninclude “[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching,\nbiting, [and] hair pulling”), online at http://www.ovw.\nusdoj.gov/domviolence.htm.5 Indeed, “most physical as-\nsaults committed against women and men by intimates\nare relatively minor and consist of pushing, grabbing,\nshoving, slapping, and hitting.” DOJ, P. Tjaden & N.\nThoennes, Extent, Nature and Consequences of Intimate\nPartner Violence 11 (2000).\n  Minor uses of force may not constitute “violence” in the\ngeneric sense. For example, in an opinion that we cited\n——————\nviolence” under §16. Matter of Velasquez, 25 I. & N. Dec. 278, 282\n(2010). Nothing in today’s opinion casts doubt on these holdings,\nbecause—as we explain—“domestic violence” encompasses a range of\nforce broader than that which constitutes “violence” simpliciter.\n  We note, as does JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence, post, at 8, and n. 7,\nthat federal law elsewhere defines “domestic violence” in more limited\nterms: For example, a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act\ndefines a “ ‘crime of domestic violence’ ” as “any crime of violence (as\ndefined by [18 U. S. C. §16])” committed against a qualifying relation. 8\nU. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E)(i). Our view that “domestic violence” encom-\npasses acts that might not constitute “violence” in a nondomestic\ncontext does not extend to a provision like this, which specifically\ndefines “domestic violence” by reference to a generic “crime of violence.”\n  5 See also    A. Ganley, Understanding Domestic Violence, in Im-\nproving the Health Care Response to Domestic Violence: A Re-\nsource Manual for Health Care Providers 18 (2d ed. 1996),\nonline at http://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/HealthCare/\nimproving_healthcare_manual_1.pdf (physical forms of domestic violence\n“may include spitting, scratching, biting, grabbing, shaking, shoving,\npushing, restraining, throwing, twisting, [or] slapping”); M. McCue,\nDomestic Violence: A Reference Handbook 6 (1995) (noting that physi-\ncal forms of domestic violence “may begin with relatively minor as-\nsaults such as painful pinching or squeezing”).\n8                 UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwith approval in Johnson, the Seventh Circuit noted that\nit was “hard to describe . . . as ‘violence’ ” “a squeeze of the\narm [that] causes a bruise.” Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d\n666, 670 (2003). But an act of this nature is easy to de-\nscribe as “domestic violence,” when the accumulation of\nsuch acts over time can subject one intimate partner to the\nother’s control. If a seemingly minor act like this draws\nthe attention of authorities and leads to a successful pros-\necution for a misdemeanor offense, it does not offend\ncommon sense or the English language to characterize the\nresulting conviction as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.”\n   JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence discounts our reference to\nsocial-science definitions of “domestic violence,” including\nthose used by the organizations most directly engaged\nwith the problem and thus most aware of its dimensions.\nSee post, at 8–11. It is important to keep in mind, how-\never, that the operative phrase we are construing is not\n“domestic violence”; it is “physical force.” §921(a)(33)(A).\n“Physical force” has a presumptive common-law meaning,\nand the question is simply whether that presumptive\nmeaning makes sense in defining a “misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence.”6\n   A third reason for distinguishing Johnson’s definition of\n“physical force” is that unlike in Johnson—where a deter-\nmination that the defendant’s crime was a “violent felony”\nwould have classified him as an “armed career criminal”—\n\n——————\n  6 The concurrence’s reliance on definitions of “domestic violence” in\n\nother statutory provisions, see post, at 8, and n. 7, is similarly unper-\nsuasive. These other provisions show that when Congress wished to\ndefine “domestic violence” as a type of “violence” simpliciter, it knew\nhow to do so. That it did not do so here suggests, if anything, that it did\nnot mean to. See, e.g., Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485, 492\n(1994). This also answers the concurrence’s suggestion, post, at 10,\nthat our holding will somehow make it difficult for Congress to define\n“domestic violence”—where it wants to—as requiring violent force.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe statute here groups those convicted of “misdemeanor\ncrimes of domestic violence” with others whose conduct\ndoes not warrant such a designation. Section 922(g) bars\ngun possession by anyone “addicted to any controlled\nsubstance,” §922(g)(3); by most people who have “been\nadmitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant\nvisa,” §922(g)(5)(B); by anyone who has renounced United\nStates citizenship, §922(g)(7); and by anyone subject to a\ndomestic restraining order, §922(g)(8). Whereas we have\nhesitated (as in Johnson) to apply the Armed Career\nCriminal Act to “crimes which, though dangerous, are not\ntypically committed by those whom one normally labels\n‘armed career criminals,’ ” Begay v. United States, 553\nU. S. 137, 146 (2008), we see no anomaly in grouping\ndomestic abusers convicted of generic assault or battery\noffenses together with the others whom §922(g) disquali-\nfies from gun ownership.\n   An additional reason to read the statute as we do is that\na contrary reading would have rendered §922(g)(9) inoper-\native in many States at the time of its enactment. The\n“assault or battery laws” under which “domestic abusers\nwere . . . routinely prosecuted” when Congress enacted\n§922(g)(9), and under which many are still prosecuted\ntoday, Hayes, 555 U. S., at 427, fall generally into two\ncategories: those that prohibit both offensive touching and\nthe causation of bodily injury, and those that prohibit only\nthe latter. See Brief for United States 36–38. Whether or\nnot the causation of bodily injury necessarily entails vio-\nlent force—a question we do not reach—mere offensive\ntouching does not. See Johnson, 559 U. S., at 139–140. So\nif offensive touching did not constitute “force” under\n§921(a)(33)(A), then §922(g)(9) would have been ineffec-\ntual in at least 10 States—home to nearly thirty percent of\nthe Nation’s population7—at the time of its enactment.\n——————\n 7 See   U. S. Census Bureau, Time Series of Intercensal State Popula-\n10                UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSee post, at 6, and n. 5 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (acknowledging that §922(g)(9)\nwould have been inapplicable in California and nine other\nStates if it did not encompass offensive touching); App. to\nBrief for United States 10a–16a (listing statutes prohibit-\ning both offensive touching and the causation of bodily\ninjury, only some of which are divisible); cf. Hayes, 555\nU. S., at 427 (rejecting an interpretation under which\n“§922(g)(9) would have been ‘a dead letter’ in some two-\nthirds of the States from the very moment of its enact-\nment”).\n   In sum, Johnson requires that we attribute the com-\nmon-law meaning of “force” to §921(a)(33)(A)’s definition of\na “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” as an offense\nthat “has, as an element, the use or attempted use\nof physical force.” We therefore hold that the requirement\nof “physical force” is satisfied, for purposes of §922(g)(9),\nby the degree of force that supports a common-law battery\nconviction.\n                             B\n  Applying this definition of “physical force,” we conclude\nthat Castleman’s conviction qualifies as a “misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence.” In doing so, we follow the\nanalytic approach of Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575\n(1990), and Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13 (2005).\nWe begin with Taylor’s categorical approach, under which\nwe look to the statute of Castleman’s conviction to deter-\nmine whether that conviction necessarily “ha[d], as an\nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the\nthreatened use of a deadly weapon,” §921(a)(33)(A).\n  The Tennessee statute under which Castleman was\nconvicted made it a crime to “commi[t] an assault . . .\n——————\ntion Estimates: April 1, 1990 to April 1, 2000, online at http://www.cen-\nsus.gov/popest/data/intercensal/st-co/files/CO-EST2001-12-00.pdf (esti-\nmating state and national populations as of July 1, 1996).\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

A provision incorporated by reference, §39–13–\n101, defined three types of assault: “(1) [i]ntentionally,\nknowingly or recklessly caus[ing] bodily injury to another;\n(2) [i]ntentionally or knowingly caus[ing] another to rea-\nsonably fear imminent bodily injury; or (3) [i]ntentionally\nor knowingly caus[ing] physical contact with another” in a\nmanner that a “reasonable person would regard . . . as\nextremely offensive or provocative.” §39–13–101(a).\n   It does not appear that every type of assault defined by\n§39–13–101 necessarily involves “the use or attempted use\nof physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon,”\n§921(a)(33)(A).      A threat under §39–13–101(2) may\nnot necessarily involve a deadly weapon, and the merely\nreckless causation of bodily injury under §39–13–101(1)\nmay not be a “use” of force.8\n   But we need not decide whether a domestic assault\nconviction in Tennessee categorically constitutes a “mis-\ndemeanor crime of domestic violence,” because the parties\n——————\n  8 We  held in Leocal that “ ‘use’ requires active employment,” rather\n“than negligent or merely accidental conduct.” 543 U.

Al-\nthough Leocal reserved the question whether a reckless application of\nforce could constitute a “use” of force, id., at 13, the Courts of Appeals\nhave almost uniformly held that recklessness is not sufficient. See\nUnited States v. Palomino Garcia, 606 F. 3d 1317, 1335–1336 (CA11\n2010); Jimenez-Gonzalez v. Mukasey, 548 F. 3d 557, 560 (CA7 2008);\nUnited States v.

CASTLEMAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndo not contest that §39–13–101 is a “ ‘divisible statute,’ ”\nDescamps v. United States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op.,\nat 1). We may accordingly apply the modified categorical\napproach, consulting the indictment to which Castleman\npleaded guilty in order to determine whether his convic-\ntion did entail the elements necessary to constitute the\ngeneric federal offense. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1–2); see\nShepard, 544 U. S., at 26. Here, that analysis is straight-\nforward: Castleman pleaded guilty to having “intentionally\nor knowingly cause[d] bodily injury” to the mother of his\nchild, App. 27, and the knowing or intentional causation of\nbodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force.\n   First, a “bodily injury” must result from “physical force.”\nUnder Tennessee law, “bodily injury” is a broad term: It\n“includes a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn or disfigurement;\nphysical pain or temporary illness or impairment of the\nfunction of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.”\nTenn. Code Ann. §39–11–106(a)(2) (1997). JUSTICE SCA-\nLIA’s concurrence suggests that these forms of injury ne-\ncessitate violent force, under Johnson’s definition of that\nphrase. Post, at 3. But whether or not that is so—a\nquestion we do not decide—these forms of injury do neces-\nsitate force in the common-law sense.\n   The District Court thought otherwise, reasoning that\none can cause bodily injury “without the ‘use of physical\nforce’ ”—for example, by “deceiving [the victim] into drink-\ning a poisoned beverage, without making contact of any\nkind.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a. But as we explained in\nJohnson, “physical force” is simply “force exerted by and\nthrough concrete bodies,” as opposed to “intellectual force\nor emotional force.” 559 U. S., at 138. And the common-\nlaw concept of “force” encompasses even its indirect ap-\nplication. “Force” in this sense “describ[es] one of the\nelements of the common-law crime of battery,” id., at 139,\nand “[t]he force used” in battery “need not be applied\ndirectly to the body of the victim.” 2 W. LaFave, Substan-\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntive Criminal Law §16.2(b) (2d ed. 2003). “[A] battery may\nbe committed by administering a poison or by infecting\nwith a disease, or even by resort to some intangible sub-\nstance,” such as a laser beam. Ibid. (footnote omitted)\n(citing State v. Monroe, 121 N. C. 677, 28 S. E. 547 (1897)\n(poison); State v. Lankford, 29 Del. 594, 102 A. 63 (1917)\n(disease); Adams v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 463, 534\nS. E. 2d 347 (2000) (laser beam)). It is impossible to cause\nbodily injury without applying force in the common-law\nsense.\n   Second, the knowing or intentional application of force\nis a “use” of force. Castleman is correct that under Leocal\nv. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), the word “use” “conveys the\nidea that the thing used (here, ‘physical force’) has been\nmade the user’s instrument.” Brief for Respondent 37.\nBut he errs in arguing that although “[p]oison may have\n‘forceful physical properties’ as a matter of organic chemis-\ntry, . . . no one would say that a poisoner ‘employs’ force or\n‘carries out a purpose by means of force’ when he or\nshe sprinkles poison in a victim’s drink,” ibid. The “use\nof force” in Castleman’s example is not the act of\n“sprinkl[ing]” the poison; it is the act of employing poison\nknowingly as a device to cause physical harm. That the\nharm occurs indirectly, rather than directly (as with a kick\nor punch), does not matter. Under Castleman’s logic, after\nall, one could say that pulling the trigger on a gun is not a\n“use of force” because it is the bullet, not the trigger, that\nactually strikes the victim. Leocal held that the “use” of\nforce must entail “a higher degree of intent than negligent\nor merely accidental conduct,” 543 U. S., at 9; it did not\nhold that the word “use” somehow alters the meaning of\n“force.”\n   Because Castleman’s indictment makes clear that the\nuse of physical force was an element of his conviction, that\nconviction qualifies as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.”\n14            UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                           III\n We are not persuaded by Castleman’s nontextual argu-\nments against our interpretation of §922(g)(9).\n                              A\n  First, Castleman invokes §922(g)(9)’s legislative history\nto suggest that Congress could not have intended for the\nprovision to apply to acts involving minimal force. But to\nthe extent that legislative history can aid in the inter-\npretation of this statute, Castleman’s reliance on it is\nunpersuasive.\n  Castleman begins by observing that during the debate\nover §922(g)(9), several Senators argued that the provision\nwould help to prevent gun violence by perpetrators of\nsevere domestic abuse. Senator Lautenberg referred to\n“serious spousal or child abuse” and to “violent individu-\nals”; Senator Hutchison to “ ‘people who batter their\nwives’ ”; Senator Wellstone to people who “brutalize” their\nwives or children; and Senator Feinstein to “severe and\nrecurring domestic violence.” 142 Cong. Rec. 22985–\n22986, 22988. But as we noted above, see supra, at 2, the\nimpetus of §922(g)(9) was that even perpetrators of severe\ndomestic violence are often convicted “under generally\napplicable assault or battery laws.” Hayes, 555 U. S., at\n427. So nothing about these Senators’ isolated references\nto severe domestic violence suggests that they would not\nhave wanted §922(g)(9) to apply to a misdemeanor assault\nconviction like Castleman’s.\n  Castleman next observes that §922(g)(9) is the product\nof a legislative compromise. The provision originally\nbarred gun possession for any “crime of domestic violence,”\ndefined as any “felony or misdemeanor crime of violence,\nregardless of length, term, or manner of punishment.” 142\nCong. Rec. 5840. Congress rewrote the provision to re-\nquire the use of physical force in response to the concern\n“that the term crime of violence was too broad, and could\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbe interpreted to include an act such as cutting up a credit\ncard with a pair of scissors,” id., at 26675. See Hayes, 555\nU. S., at 428. Castleman would have us conclude that\nCongress thus meant “to narrow the scope of the statute to\nconvictions based on especially severe conduct.” Brief for\nRespondent 24. But all Congress meant to do was address\nthe fear that §922(g)(9) might be triggered by offenses in\nwhich no force at all was directed at a person. As Senator\nLautenberg noted, the revised text was not only “more\nprecise” than the original but also “probably broader.” 142\nCong. Rec. 26675.\n                            B\n   We are similarly unmoved by Castleman’s invocation of\nthe rule of lenity. Castleman is correct that our “construc-\ntion of a criminal statute must be guided by the need for\nfair warning.” Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152,\n160 (1990). But “the rule of lenity only applies if, after\nconsidering text, structure, history, and purpose, there\nremains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the stat-\nute, such that the Court must simply guess as to what\nCongress intended.” Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S. 474, 488\n(2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nThat is not the case here.\n                              C\n  Finally, Castleman suggests—in a single paragraph—\nthat we should read §922(g)(9) narrowly because it impli-\ncates his constitutional right to keep and bear arms. But\nCastleman has not challenged the constitutionality of\n§922(g)(9), either on its face or as applied to him, and the\nmeaning of the statute is sufficiently clear that we need\nnot indulge Castleman’s cursory nod to constitutional\navoidance concerns.\n                     *    *   *\n  Castleman’s conviction for having “intentionally or\n16             UNITED STATES v.

JAMES ALVIN \n\n                 CASTLEMAN\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                       [March 26, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in\nthe judgment.\n  I agree with the Court that intentionally or knowingly\ncausing bodily injury to a family member “has, as an\nelement, the use . . . of physical force,” 18 U. S. C.\n§ §921(a)(33)(A)(ii), and thus constitutes a “misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence,” §922(g)(9). I write separately,\nhowever, because I reach that conclusion on narrower\ngrounds.\n                               I\n  Our decision in Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133\n(2010), is the natural place to begin. Johnson is signifi-\ncant here because it concluded that “the phrase ‘physical\nforce’ means violent force—that is, force capable of caus-\ning physical pain or injury to another person.” Id., at\n140 (second emphasis added). This is an easy case if\nthe phrase “physical force” has the same meaning in\n§921(a)(33)(A)(ii), the provision that defines “misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence” for purposes of §922(g)(9), as it\ndoes in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), the provision interpreted in John-\nson, since it is impossible to cause bodily injury without\nusing force “capable of ” producing that result.\n  There are good reasons to give the phrase Johnson’s\ninterpretation. One is the presumption of consistent\n2              UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nusage—the rule of thumb that a term generally means the\nsame thing each time it is used. Although the presump-\ntion is most commonly applied to terms appearing in the\nsame enactment, e.g., IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21,\n33–34 (2005), it is equally relevant “when Congress uses the\nsame language in two statutes having similar purposes,”\nSmith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228, 233 (2005)\n(plurality opinion); see also Northcross v. Board of Ed. of\nMemphis City Schools, 412 U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per\ncuriam). This case is a textbook candidate for application\nof the Smith-Northcross branch of the rule. The “physical\nforce” clauses at issue here and in Johnson are worded in\nnearly identical fashion: The former defines a “misde-\nmeanor crime of domestic violence” as an offense that\n“has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical\nforce,” §921(a)(33)(A)(ii), while the latter defines a “violent\nfelony” as an offense that “has as an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against\nthe person of another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i). And both statutes\nare designed to promote public safety by deterring a class\nof criminals from possessing firearms.\n   Respondent’s arguments fail to overcome the presump-\ntion of consistent usage. In respondent’s view, “physical\nforce” cannot mean “any force that produces any pain\nor bodily injury,” Brief for Respondent 25, because\n§921(a)(33)(A)(ii) defines a violent crime and one can in-\nflict all sorts of minor injuries—bruises, paper cuts,\netc.—by engaging in nonviolent behavior. Respondent\ntherefore reasons that §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) requires force capa-\nble of inflicting “serious” bodily injury. That requirement\nis more demanding than both of the plausible mean-\nings of “physical force” we identified in Johnson: common-\nlaw offensive touching (which Johnson rejected) and force\ncapable of causing physical pain or injury, serious or\notherwise. See 559 U. S., at 138–140. It would be surpas-\nsing strange to read a statute defining a “misdemeanor\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ncrime of domestic violence” as requiring greater force than\nthe similarly worded statute in Johnson, which defined a\n“violent felony,” and respondent does not make a convinc-\ning case for taking that extraordinary step.\n  For these reasons, I would give “physical force” the same\nmeaning in §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) as in Johnson. The rest of\nthe analysis is straightforward. Because “intentionally or\nknowingly caus[ing] bodily injury,” App. 27, categorically\ninvolves the use of “force capable of causing physical pain\nor injury to another person,” 559 U. S., at 140, respond-\nent’s 2001 domestic-assault conviction qualifies as a “mis-\ndemeanor crime of domestic violence” under §922(g)(9).1\nI would reverse the judgment below on that basis and\nremand for further proceedings.\n                             II\n   Unfortunately, the Court bypasses that narrower inter-\npretation of §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) in favor of a much broader\none that treats any offensive touching, no matter how\nslight, as sufficient. That expansive common-law defini-\ntion cannot be squared with relevant precedent or statu-\ntory text.\n   We have twice addressed the meaning of “physical force”\nin the context of provisions that define a class of violent\ncrimes. Both times, we concluded that “physical force”\nmeans violent force. In Johnson, we thought it “clear that\nin the context of a statutory definition of ‘violent felony,’\nthe phrase ‘physical force’ means violent force.” Id., at\n140. And we held that common-law offensive touching—\nthe same type of force the Court today holds does consti-\ntute “physical force”—is not sufficiently violent to satisfy\n——————\n  1 Respondent argues at length that Tenn. Code Ann. §39–13–111(b)\n\n(2013 Supp.) does not require the “use” of physical force, since it is\npossible to cause bodily injury through deceit or other nonviolent\nmeans. Brief for Respondent 30–42. The argument fails for the rea-\nsons given by the Court. See ante, at 13.\n4                UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act’s “physical force” require-\nment. See id., at 140–144. Our analysis in Johnson was\npremised in large part on our earlier interpretation of the\ngeneric federal “crime of violence” statute, 18 U. S. C. §16.\nIn Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11 (2004), we observed\nthat §16(a)—which defines a “crime of violence” as “an\noffense that has as an element the use, attempted use,\nor threatened use of physical force against the person or\nproperty of another”—comprehends “a category of vio-\nlent, active crimes.” The textual similarity between\n§921(a)(33)(A)(ii)’s “physical force” clause and the clauses\nat issue in Johnson and Leocal thus raises the question:\nWhy should the same meaning not apply here?\n   The Court gives four responses that merit discussion,\nnone of which withstands scrutiny. First, the Court in-\nvokes the “ ‘settled principle of interpretation that, absent\nother indication, “Congress intends to incorporate the\nwell-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.” ’ ”\nAnte, at 4 (quoting Sekhar v. United States, 570 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 3)). That principle is of limited\nrelevance, since the presumption of consistent statutory\nmeaning is precisely “other indication” that §921(a)(33)\n(A)(ii) does not incorporate the common-law meaning.\nAnyway, a more accurate formulation of the principle\ncited by the Court is that when “ ‘a word is obviously\ntransplanted from another legal source, whether the\ncommon law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with\nit.’ ” Sekhar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3–4) (quoting\nFrankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes,\n47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947); emphasis added).\nSection 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) was enacted after the statutes\ninvolved in Johnson and Leocal,2 and its “physical force”\n——————\n  2 Section §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) was enacted in 1996.

But there is no\ninterpretive principle to the effect that statutes must be\ngiven their broadest possible application, and §922(g)(9)\nwithout offensive touching would have had application in\nfour-fifths of the States. Although domestic violence was\n“routinely prosecuted” under misdemeanor assault or bat-\ntery statutes when Congress enacted §922(g)(9), United\nStates v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 427 (2009), and such stat-\nutes generally prohibited “both offensive touching and the\ncausation of bodily injury” or “only the latter,” ante, at 9, it\ndoes not follow that interpreting “physical force” to mean\nviolent force would have rendered §922(g)(9) a practical\nnullity. To the contrary, §922(g)(9) would have worked\nperfectly well in 38 of the 48 States that had misdemeanor\nassault or battery statutes at the time of §922(g)(9)’s\nenactment. At that point, 19 States had statutes that\ncovered infliction of bodily injury but not offensive touch-\ning,3 and 19 more had statutes that prohibited both of\ntypes of conduct, but did so in a divisible manner—thus\n——————\n“crime of violence” statute discussed in Leocal was enacted in 1984, see\n§1001, 98 Stat. 2136.\n  3 See Ala.

United States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip\nop., at 5–8).4 That leaves only 10 States whose misde-\nmeanor assault or battery statutes (1) prohibited offensive\ntouching, and (2) were framed in such a way that offensive\ntouching was indivisible from physical violence.5 The fact\nthat §922(g)(9) would not have applied immediately in 10\nStates is hardly enough to trigger the presumption against\nineffectiveness—the idea that Congress presumably does\nnot enact useless laws. Compare Hayes, supra, at 427\n(rejecting an interpretation that supposedly would have\nrendered §922(g)(9) “ ‘a dead letter’ in some two-thirds of\nthe States”). I think it far more plausible that Congress\nenacted a statute that covered domestic-violence convic-\ntions in four-fifths of the States, and left it to the handful\nof nonconforming States to change their laws (as some\nhave), than that Congress adopted a meaning of “domestic\nviolence” that included the slightest unwanted touching.\n——————\n  4 See Ariz.

We properly take\naccount of the term being defined when interpreting “an\nunclear definitional phrase.” United States v. Stevens, 559\nU. S. 460, 474 (2010); but see Babbitt v. Sweet Home\nChapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 717–\n719 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But when we do so, we\nconsider the entire term being defined, not just part of it.\nHere, the term being defined is “misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence.” Applying the term-to-be-defined canon\nthus yields the unremarkable conclusion that “physical\nforce” in §921(a)(33)(A)(ii) refers to the type of force in-\nvolved in violent misdemeanors (such as bodily-injury\noffenses) rather than nonviolent ones (such as offensive\ntouching).\n   Fourth, and finally, the Court seeks to evade Johnson\nand Leocal on the ground that “ ‘domestic violence’ encom-\npasses a range of force broader than that which con-\nstitutes ‘violence’ simpliciter.” Ante, at 6, n. 4. That is\nto say, an act need not be violent to qualify as “domestic\nviolence.” That absurdity is not only at war with the\nEnglish language, it is flatly inconsistent with defini-\ntions of “domestic violence” from the period surrounding\n§921(a)(33)(A)(ii)’s enactment. At the time, dictionaries\ndefined “domestic violence” as, for instance, “[v]iolence\nbetween members of a household, usu. spouses; an assault\nor other violent act committed by one member of a house-\nhold against another,” Black’s Law Dictionary 1564 (7th\ned. 1999), and “[v]iolence toward or physical abuse of one’s\nspouse or domestic partner,” American Heritage Diction-\nary 534 (4th ed. 2000).6 Those definitions, combined with\n——————\n 6 Definitions   of “physical force” from the same period are also at odds\n8                 UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe absence of “domestic violence” entries in earlier dic-\ntionaries, see, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 484 (6th ed.\n1990); American Heritage Dictionary 550 (3d ed. 1992),\nmake it utterly implausible that Congress adopted a “term\nof art” definition “encompassing acts that one might not\ncharacterize as ‘violent’ in a nondomestic context,” ante,\nat 7.\n   The Court’s inventive, nonviolent definition fares no\nbetter when judged against other accepted sources of\nmeaning. Current dictionaries give “domestic violence”\nthe same meaning as above: ordinary violence that occurs\nin a domestic context. See, e.g., American Heritage Dic-\ntionary 533 (5th ed. 2011) (“[p]hysical abuse of a house-\nhold member, especially one’s spouse or domestic partner”).\nThe same goes for definitions of “domestic violence”\nfound in other federal statutes.7 Indeed, Congress defined\n“crime of domestic violence” as a “crime of violence” in\nanother section of the same bill that enacted §921(a)\n(33)(A)(ii). See §350(a), 110 Stat. 3009–639, codified at\n8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E)(i).\n   The Court ignores these authorities and instead bases\nits definition on an amicus brief filed by the National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence and other private\n\n——————\nwith the Court’s nonviolent interpretation of that phrase. See Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 656 (7th ed. 1999) (“[f]orce consisting in a physical act,\nesp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim”); id., at 1147 (6th\ned. 1990) (“[f]orce applied to the body; actual violence”).\n   7 See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §2261(a)(1) (defining as “[i]nterstate domestic\n\nviolence” certain “crime[s] of violence”); §3561(b) (“The term ‘domestic\nviolence crime’ means a crime of violence . . . in which the victim or\nintended victim is the [defendant’s] spouse” or other qualifying rela-\ntion); 25 U. S. C. A. §1304(a)(2) (“The term ‘domestic violence’ means\nviolence committed by a current or former spouse or” other qualifying\nrelation); 42 U. S. C. A. §13925(a)(8) (Sept. 2013 Supp.) (“The term\n‘domestic violence’ includes felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence\ncommitted by a current or former spouse” or other qualifying relation).\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

For example, amici’s\ndefinitions describe as “domestic violence” acts that “hu-\nmiliate, isolate, frighten, . . . [and] blame . . . someone”;\n“acts of omission”; “excessive monitoring of a woman’s\nbehavior, repeated accusations of infidelity, and control-\nling with whom she has contact.” Brief for National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence et al. as Amici Curiae\n5–8, and nn. 7, 11. The offerings of the Department\nof Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women are\nequally capacious and (to put it mildly) unconventional.\nIts publications define “domestic violence” as “a pattern\nof abusive behavior . . . used by one partner to gain\nor maintain power and control over another,” including\n“[u]ndermining an individual’s sense of self-worth,”\n“name-calling,” and “damaging one’s relationship with\nhis or her children.” See, e.g., Domestic Violence, online\nat http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/domviolence.htm (all Internet\nmaterials as visited Mar. 21, 2014, and available in the\nClerk of Court’s case file).9\n——————\n  8 The  other organizations on the brief are the National Domestic\nViolence Hotline, the Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and\nAppeals Project, Legal Momentum, and innumerable state organiza-\ntions against domestic violence.\n   9 The Court refers in a footnote to two additional social-science defini-\n\ntions, neither of which aids the Court’s cause. See ante, at 7, n. 5. The\nfirst is drawn from a health-care manual that provides “a behavioral\ndefinition of domestic violence . . . rather than a legal definition, since a\n10                UNITED STATES v. CASTLEMAN\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   Of course these private organizations and the Depart-\nment of Justice’s (nonprosecuting) Office are entitled to\ndefine “domestic violence” any way they want for their\nown purposes—purposes that can include (quite literally)\ngiving all domestic behavior harmful to women a bad\nname. (What is more abhorrent than violence against\nwomen?) But when they (and the Court) impose their all-\nembracing definition on the rest of us, they not only\ndistort the law, they impoverish the language. When\neverything is domestic violence, nothing is. Congress will\nhave to come up with a new word (I cannot imagine what\nit would be) to denote actual domestic violence.\n   Although the Justice Department’s definitions ought to\nbe deemed unreliable in toto on the basis of their extrava-\ngant extensions alone (falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus),\nthe Court chooses to focus only upon the physical actions\nthat they include, viz., “[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grab-\nbing, pinching, biting, [and] hair pulling.” Ibid. None of\nthose actions bears any real resemblance to mere offensive\ntouching, and all of them are capable of causing physical\npain or injury. Cf. Johnson, 559 U. S., at 143 (identifying\n“a slap in the face” as conduct that might rise to the level\nof violent force). And in any event, the Department of\nJustice thankfully receives no deference in our interpreta-\n——————\nbehavioral definition is more comprehensive and more relevant to the\nhealth care setting.” A. Ganley, Understanding Domestic Violence, in\nImproving the Health Care Response to Domestic Violence: A Resource\nManual for Health Care Providers 18 (2d ed. 1996) (emphasis added),\nonline at http://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/HealthCare/\nimproving_healthcare_manual_1.pdf. Here, of course, we are concerned\nwith the less comprehensive legal definition. The second definition\nreferred to in the footnote equates domestic violence with “overt vio-\nlence,” which in its least serious form consists of “painful pinching or\nsqueezing.” M. McCue, Domestic Violence: A Reference Handbook 6\n(1995) (emphasis added). That meaning is consistent with Johnson’s\ndefinition of “physical force,” but it plainly does not include harmless\noffensive touching.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

S. C. §921(a)(33)(A)(ii). In Johnson v. United States,\n559 U. S. 133 (2010), the Court interpreted the very same\nlanguage and held that “physical force” means “violent\nforce.” Id., at 140. I disagreed and concluded that the\nphrase incorporated the well-established meaning of\n“force” under the common law of battery, which did not\nrequire violent force. See id., at 146 (dissenting opinion).\n   The Court of Appeals in the present case understand-\nably followed the reasoning of Johnson, but now this Court\nholds that Johnson actually dictates that the identical\nstatutory language be interpreted in exactly the same way\nthat the Johnson majority rejected. See ante, at 5.\n   In my view, the meaning of the contested statutory\nlanguage is the same now as it was four years ago in\nJohnson, and therefore, for the reasons set out in my\nJohnson dissent, I would not extend the reasoning of\nJohnson to the question presented here, on which the\nJohnson Court specifically reserved judgment. 559 U.
