BARACK H. OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF\n\n          THE UNITED STATES, ET AL. \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n     STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF\n\n                   COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                  No. 13–638.       Decided April 21, 2014\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   Statement of JUSTICE BREYER respecting the denial of\ncertiorari.\n   The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF),\npassed in September 2001, empowers the President to “use\nall necessary and appropriate force against those nations,\norganizations, or persons he determines planned, author-\nized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that oc-\ncurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organiza-\ntions or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of\ninternational terrorism against the United States by such\nnations, organizations or persons.” §2(a), 115 Stat. 224.\nIn Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507 (2004), five Members\nof the Court agreed that the AUMF authorizes the Presi-\ndent to detain enemy combatants. Id., at 517–518 (plural-\nity opinion); id., at 587 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). In her\nopinion for a plurality of the Court, Justice O’Connor\nunderstood enemy combatants to include “an individual\nwho . . . was part of or supporting forces hostile to the\nUnited States or coalition partners in Afghanistan and\nwho engaged in an armed conflict against the United\nStates there.” Id., at 516 (internal quotation marks omit-\n2                    HUSSAIN v. OBAMA\n\n                    Statement of BREYER, J.\n\nted). She concluded that the “detention of individuals\nfalling into the limited category we are considering, for the\nduration of the particular conflict in which they were\ncaptured,” is “an exercise of the ‘necessary and appropriate\nforce’ ” that Congress authorized under the AUMF. Id., at\n518 (emphasis added). She explained, however, that the\nPresident’s power to detain under the AUMF may be\ndifferent when the “practical circumstances” of the rele-\nvant conflict are “entirely unlike those of the conflicts that\ninformed the development of the law of war.” Id., at 521.\n   In this case, the District Court concluded, and the Court\nof Appeals agreed, that petitioner Abdul Al Qader Ahmed\nHussain could be detained under the AUMF because he\nwas “part of al-Qaeda or the Taliban at the time of his\napprehension.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

But even\nassuming this is correct, in either case—that is, irrespec-\ntive of whether Hussain was part of al Qaeda or the Tali-\nban—it is possible that Hussain was not an “individual\nwho . . . was part of or supporting forces hostile to the\nUnited States or coalition partners in Afghanistan and\nwho engaged in an armed conflict against the United\nStates there.” 542 U. S., at 516 (emphasis added).\n   The Court has not directly addressed whether the\nAUMF authorizes, and the Constitution permits, deten-\ntion on the basis that an individual was part of al Qaeda,\nor part of the Taliban, but was not “engaged in an armed\nconflict against the United States” in Afghanistan prior to\nhis capture. Nor have we considered whether, assuming\ndetention on these bases is permissible, either the AUMF\nor the Constitution limits the duration of detention.\n   The circumstances of Hussain’s detention may involve\nthese unanswered questions, but his petition does not ask\nus to answer them. See Pet. for Cert. i. Therefore, I agree\nwith the Court’s decision to deny certiorari.\n</pre>", "id": 2670643, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/04/21/hussain_v._obama.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                       Cite as: 572 U.
