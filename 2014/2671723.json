Argued February 26, 2014—Decided April 29, 2014\nThe Patent Act’s fee-shifting provision authorizes district courts to\n  award attorney’s fees to prevailing parties in “exceptional cases.” 35\n  U. S. C. §285. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc.,\n  393 F. 3d 1378, 1381, the Federal Circuit defined an “exceptional\n  case” as one which either involves “material inappropriate conduct”\n  or is both “objectively baseless” and “brought in subjective bad faith.”\n  Brooks Furniture also requires that parties establish the “exception-\n  al” nature of a case by “clear and convincing evidence.” Id., at 1382.\n     Respondent ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., sued petitioner Octane\n  Fitness, LLC, for patent infringement. The District Court granted\n  summary judgment to Octane. Octane then moved for attorney’s fees\n  under §285. The District Court denied the motion under the Brooks\n  Furniture framework, finding ICON’s claim to be neither objectively\n  baseless nor brought in subjective bad faith. The Federal Circuit af-\n  firmed.\nHeld: The Brooks Furniture framework is unduly rigid and impermissi-\n bly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district courts.\n Pp. 7–12.\n    (a) Section 285 imposes one and only one constraint on district\n courts’ discretion to award attorney’s fees: The power is reserved for\n “exceptional” cases. Because the Patent Act does not define “excep-\n tional,” the term is construed “in accordance with [its] ordinary\n meaning.” Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U. S. ___, ___. In 1952, when Con-\n gress used the word in §285 (and today, for that matter),\n “[e]xceptional” meant “uncommon,” “rare,” or “not ordinary.” Web-\n ster’s New International Dictionary 889 (2d ed. 1934). An “excep-\n tional” case, then, is simply one that stands out from others with re-\n2     OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    spect to the substantive strength of a party’s litigating position (con-\n    sidering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the un-\n    reasonable manner in which the case was litigated. District courts\n    may determine whether a case is “exceptional” in the case-by-case\n    exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circum-\n    stances. Cf. Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517. Pp. 7–8.\n       (b) The Brooks Furniture framework superimposes an inflexible\n    framework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible. Pp. 8–11.\n         (1) Brooks Furniture is too restrictive in defining the two catego-\n    ries of cases in which fee awards are allowed. The first category—\n    cases involving litigation or certain other misconduct—appears to ex-\n    tend largely to independently sanctionable conduct. But that is not\n    the appropriate benchmark. A district court may award fees in the\n    rare case in which a party’s unreasonable, though not independently\n    sanctionable, conduct is so “exceptional” as to justify an award. For\n    litigation to fall within the second category, a district court must de-\n    termine that the litigation is both objectively baseless and brought in\n    subjective bad faith. But a case presenting either subjective bad\n    faith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself\n    apart from mine-run cases to be “exceptional.” The Federal Circuit\n    imported this second category from Professional Real Estate Inves-\n    tors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49, but that\n    case’s standard finds no roots in §285’s text and makes little sense in\n    the context of the exceptional-case determination. Pp. 8–10.\n         (2) Brooks Furniture is so demanding that it would appear to\n    render §285 largely superfluous. Because courts already possess the\n    inherent power to award fees in cases involving misconduct or bad\n    faith, see Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S.\n    240, 258–259, this Court has declined to construe fee-shifting provi-\n    sions narrowly so as to avoid rendering them superfluous. See, e.g.,\n    Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 419. Pp. 10–11.\n         (3) Brooks Furniture’s requirement that proof of entitlement to\n    fees be made by clear and convincing evidence is not justified by\n    §285, which imposes no specific evidentiary burden. Nor has this\n    Court interpreted comparable fee-shifting statutes to require such a\n    burden of proof. See, e.g., Fogerty, 510 U. S, at 519. P. 11.\n496 Fed.

Rather, the “American Rule” governed:\n“ ‘[E]ach litigant pa[id] his own attorney’s fees, win or\nlose . . . .’ ” Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 9). In 1946, Congress amended the\nPatent Act to add a discretionary fee-shifting provision,\nthen codified in §70, which stated that a court “may in its\ndiscretion award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevail-\ning party upon the entry of judgment in any patent case.”\n35 U. S. C. §70 (1946 ed.).1\n    Courts did not award fees under §70 as a matter of\ncourse. They viewed the award of fees not “as a penalty\nfor failure to win a patent infringement suit,” but as ap-\npropriate “only in extraordinary circumstances.” Park-In-\nTheatres, Inc. v. Perkins, 190 F. 2d 137, 142 (CA9 1951).\nThe provision enabled them to address “unfairness or bad\nfaith in the conduct of the losing party, or some other\nequitable consideration of similar force,” which made a\ncase so unusual as to warrant fee-shifting. Ibid.; see also\nPennsylvania Crusher Co. v. Bethlehem Steel Co., 193 F.\n2d 445, 451 (CA3 1951) (listing as “adequate justifica-\ntion[s]” for fee awards “fraud practiced on the Patent\nOffice or vexatious or unjustified litigation”).\n    Six years later, Congress amended the fee-shifting\nprovision and recodified it as §285. Whereas §70 had\nspecified that a district court could “in its discretion award\nreasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party,” the\nrevised language of §285 (which remains in force today)\nprovides that “[t]he court in exceptional cases may award\nreasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.” We have\nobserved, in interpreting the damages provision of the\nPatent Act, that the addition of the phrase “exceptional\n\n\n——————\n  1 This provision did “not contemplat[e] that the recovery of attorney’s\n\nfees [would] become an ordinary thing in patent suits . . . .” S.

S. 648, 653,\nn. 8 (1983); see also id., at 652, n. 6. And the parties agree\nthat the recodification did not substantively alter the\nmeaning of the statute.3\n   For three decades after the enactment of §285, courts\napplied it—as they had applied §70—in a discretionary\nmanner, assessing various factors to determine whether a\ngiven case was sufficiently “exceptional” to warrant a fee\naward. See, e.g., True Temper Corp. v. CF&I Steel Corp.,\n601 F. 2d 495, 508–509 (CA10 1979); Kearney & Trecker\nCorp. v. Giddings & Lewis, Inc., 452 F. 2d 579, 597 (CA7\n1971); Siebring v. Hansen, 346 F. 2d 474, 480–481 (CA8\n1965).\n   In 1982, Congress created the Federal Circuit and vested\nit with exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent cases.\n28 U. S. C. §1295. In the two decades that followed, the\nFederal Circuit, like the regional circuits before it, in-\nstructed district courts to consider the totality of the cir-\ncumstances when making fee determinations under §285.\nSee, e.g., Rohm & Haas Co. v. Crystal Chemical Co., 736\nF. 2d 688, 691 (1984) (“Cases decided under §285 have\nnoted that ‘the substitution of the phrase “in exceptional\ncases” has not done away with the discretionary feature’ ”);\n——————\n  2 The Senate Report similarly explained that the new provision was\n\n“substantially the same as” §70, and that the “ ‘exceptional cases’ ”\nlanguage was added simply to “expres[s] the intention of the [1946]\nstatute as shown by its legislative history and as interpreted by the\ncourts.” S. Rep. No. 82–1979, p. 30 (1952).\n  3 See Brief for Petitioner 35 (“[T]his amendment was not intended to\n\ncreate a stricter standard for fee awards, but instead was intended to\nclarify and endorse the already-existing statutory standard”); Brief for\nRespondent 17 (“When it enacted §285, as the historical notes to this\nprovision make clear, Congress adopted the standards applied by courts\ninterpreting that statute’s predecessor, §70 of the 1946 statute. Con-\ngress explained that §285 ‘is substantially the same as the correspond-\ning provision in’ §70”).\n4     OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nYamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. v. Danbury Phar­\nmacal, Inc., 231 F. 3d 1339, 1347 (2000) (“In assessing\nwhether a case qualifies as exceptional, the district court\nmust look at the totality of the circumstances”).\n   In 2005, however, the Federal Circuit abandoned that\nholistic, equitable approach in favor of a more rigid and\nmechanical formulation. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v.\nDutailier Int’l, Inc., 393 F. 3d 1378 (2005), the court held\nthat a case is “exceptional” under §285 only “when there\nhas been some material inappropriate conduct related to\nthe matter in litigation, such as willful infringement,\nfraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent,\nmisconduct during litigation, vexatious or unjustified\nlitigation, conduct that violates Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, or like\ninfractions.” Id., at 1381. “Absent misconduct in conduct\nof the litigation or in securing the patent,” the Federal\nCircuit continued, fees “may be imposed against the pa-\ntentee only if both (1) the litigation is brought in subjec-\ntive bad faith, and (2) the litigation is objectively base-\nless.” Ibid. The Federal Circuit subsequently clarified\nthat litigation is objectively baseless only if it is “so unrea-\nsonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it would\nsucceed,” iLOR, LLC v. Google, Inc., 631 F. 3d 1372, 1378\n(2011), and that litigation is brought in subjective bad\nfaith only if the plaintiff “actually know[s]” that it is objec-\ntively baseless, id., at 1377.4\n——————\n    4 In\n       Kilopass Technology, Inc. v. Sidense Corp., 738 F. 3d 1302 (CA\nFed 2013)—decided after our grant of certiorari but before we heard\noral argument in this case—the Federal Circuit appeared to cut back on\nthe “subjective bad faith” inquiry, holding that the language in iLOR\nwas dictum and that “actual knowledge of baselessness is not required.”\n738 F. 3d, at 1310. Rather, the court held, “a defendant need only\nprove reckless conduct to satisfy the subjective component of the §285\nanalysis,” ibid., and courts may “dra[w] an inference of bad faith from\ncircumstantial evidence thereof when a patentee pursues claims that\nare devoid of merit,” id., at 1311.

The respondent, ICON Health & Fitness,\nInc., owns U. S. Patent No. 6,019,710 (’710 patent), which\ndiscloses an elliptical exercise machine that allows for\nadjustments to fit the individual stride paths of users.\nICON is a major manufacturer of exercise equipment, but\nit has never commercially sold the machine disclosed in\nthe ’710 patent. The petitioner, Octane Fitness, LLC, also\nmanufactures exercise equipment, including elliptical\nmachines known as the Q45 and Q47.\n   ICON sued Octane, alleging that the Q45 and Q47\ninfringed several claims of the ’710 patent.

It determined that Octane could show\nneither that ICON’s claim was objectively baseless nor\nthat ICON had brought it in subjective bad faith. As to\nobjective baselessness, the District Court rejected Octane’s\n—————— \n\ninference of bad faith to establish exceptionality under §285, unless the \n\ncircumstances as a whole show a lack of recklessness on the patentee’s \n\npart.” Id., at 1314. Chief Judge Rader wrote a concurring opinion that\n\nsharply criticized Brooks Furniture, 738 F. 3d, at 1318–1320; the court, \n\nhe said, “should have remained true to its original reading of” §285, id.,\n\nat 1320.\n\n6   OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v.

Id., *2. The court ex-\nplained that although it had rejected ICON’s infringement\narguments, they were neither “frivolous” nor “objectively\nbaseless.” Id., *2–*3. The court also found no subjective\nbad faith on ICON’s part, dismissing as insufficient both\n“the fact that [ICON] is a bigger company which never\ncommercialized the ’710 patent” and an e-mail exchange\nbetween two ICON sales executives, which Octane had\noffered as evidence that ICON had brought the infringe-\nment action “as a matter of commercial strategy.”5 Id., *4.\n   ICON appealed the judgment of noninfringement, and\nOctane cross-appealed the denial of attorney’s fees. The\nFederal Circuit affirmed both orders. 496 Fed. Appx. 57\n(2012). In upholding the denial of attorney’s fees, it re-\njected Octane’s argument that the District Court had\n“applied an overly restrictive standard in refusing to find\nthe case exceptional under §285.” Id., at 65.

But sanctionable conduct\nis not the appropriate benchmark. Under the standard\nannounced today, a district court may award fees in the\nrare case in which a party’s unreasonable conduct—while\nnot necessarily independently sanctionable—is nonethe-\nless so “exceptional” as to justify an award of fees.\n   The second category of cases in which the Federal Cir-\ncuit allows fee awards is also too restrictive. In order for a\ncase to fall within this second category, a district court\nmust determine both that the litigation is objectively\nbaseless and that the plaintiff brought it in subjective bad\nfaith. But a case presenting either subjective bad faith or\nexceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself\napart from mine-run cases to warrant a fee award. Cf.\nNoxell, 771 F. 2d, at 526 (“[W]e think it fair to assume\nthat Congress did not intend rigidly to limit recovery of\nfees by a [Lanham Act] defendant to the rare case in\nwhich a court finds that the plaintiff ‘acted in bad faith,\nvexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons’ . . . .\nSomething less than ‘bad faith,’ we believe, suffices to\nmark a case as ‘exceptional’ ”).\n   ICON argues that the dual requirement of “subjective\nbad faith” and “objective baselessness” follows from this\nCourt’s decision in Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc.\nv. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49 (1993)\n(PRE), which involved an exception to the Noerr-\nPennington doctrine of antitrust law. It does not. Under\nthe Noerr-Pennington doctrine—established by Eastern\nRailroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight,\nInc., 365 U. S. 127 (1961), and Mine Workers v. Penning­\nton, 381 U. S. 657 (1965)—defendants are immune from\nantitrust liability for engaging in conduct (including litiga-\ntion) aimed at influencing decisionmaking by the govern-\nment. PRE, 508 U. S., at 56. But under a “sham excep-\ntion” to this doctrine, “activity ‘ostensibly directed toward\n10 OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninfluencing governmental action’ does not qualify for\nNoerr immunity if it ‘is a mere sham to cover . . . an at-\ntempt to interfere directly with the business relationships\nof a competitor.’ ” Id., at 51. In PRE, we held that to\nqualify as a “sham,” a “lawsuit must be objectively base-\nless” and must “concea[l] ‘an attempt to interfere directly\nwith the business relationships of a competitor . . . .’ ” Id.,\nat 60–61 (emphasis deleted). In other words, the plaintiff\nmust have brought baseless claims in an attempt to\nthwart competition (i.e., in bad faith).\n   In Brooks Furniture, the Federal Circuit imported the\nPRE standard into §285. See 393 F. 3d, at 1381. But the\nPRE standard finds no roots in the text of §285, and it\nmakes little sense in the context of determining whether a\ncase is so “exceptional” as to justify an award of attorney’s\nfees in patent litigation. We crafted the Noerr-Pennington\ndoctrine—and carved out only a narrow exception for\n“sham” litigation—to avoid chilling the exercise of the\nFirst Amendment right to petition the government for the\nredress of grievances. See PRE, 508 U. S., at 56 (“Those\nwho petition government for redress are generally im-\nmune from antitrust liability”). But to the extent that\npatent suits are similarly protected as acts of petitioning,\nit is not clear why the shifting of fees in an “exceptional”\ncase would diminish that right. The threat of antitrust\nliability (and the attendant treble damages, 15 U. S. C.\n§15) far more significantly chills the exercise of the right\nto petition than does the mere shifting of attorney’s fees.\nIn the Noerr-Pennington context, defendants seek immun-\nity from a judicial declaration that their filing of a lawsuit\nwas actually unlawful; here, they seek immunity from a\nfar less onerous declaration that they should bear the\ncosts of that lawsuit in exceptional cases.\n                           2\n  We reject Brooks Furniture for another reason: It is so\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

We have long recognized a common-law\nexception to the general “American rule” against fee-\nshifting—an exception, “inherent” in the “power [of] the\ncourts” that applies for “ ‘willful disobedience of a court\norder’ ” or “when the losing party has ‘acted in bad faith,\nvexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons . . . .’ ”\nAlyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421\nU. S. 240, 258–259 (1975). We have twice declined to\nconstrue fee-shifting provisions narrowly on the basis that\ndoing so would render them superfluous, given the back-\nground exception to the American rule, see Christiansburg\nGarment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 419 (1978); Newman\nv. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, 402, n. 4\n(1968) (per curiam), and we again decline to do so here.\n                              3\n   Finally, we reject the Federal Circuit’s requirement that\npatent litigants establish their entitlement to fees under\n§285 by “clear and convincing evidence,” Brooks Furniture,\n393 F. 3d, at 1382. We have not interpreted comparable\nfee-shifting statutes to require proof of entitlement to fees\nby clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., Fogerty, 510\nU. S., at 519; Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.\n384 (1990); Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558\n(1988). And nothing in §285 justifies such a high standard\nof proof. Section 285 demands a simple discretionary\ninquiry; it imposes no specific evidentiary burden, much\nless such a high one. Indeed, patent-infringement litiga-\ntion has always been governed by a preponderance of the\nevidence standard, see, e.g., Béné v. Jeantet, 129 U. S. 683,\n688 (1889), and that is the “standard generally applicable\nin civil actions,” because it “allows both parties to ‘share\nthe risk of error in roughly equal fashion,’ ” Herman &\nMacLean v.

Argued February 26, 2014—Decided April 29, 2014\nThe Patent Act’s fee-shifting provision authorizes district courts to\n  award attorney’s fees to prevailing parties in “exceptional cases.” 35\n  U. S. C. §285. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc.,\n  393 F. 3d 1378, 1381, the Federal Circuit defined an “exceptional\n  case” as one which either involves “material inappropriate conduct”\n  or is both “objectively baseless” and “brought in subjective bad faith.”\n  Brooks Furniture also requires that parties establish the “exception-\n  al” nature of a case by “clear and convincing evidence.” Id., at 1382.\n     Respondent ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., sued petitioner Octane\n  Fitness, LLC, for patent infringement. The District Court granted\n  summary judgment to Octane. Octane then moved for attorney’s fees\n  under §285. The District Court denied the motion under the Brooks\n  Furniture framework, finding ICON’s claim to be neither objectively\n  baseless nor brought in subjective bad faith. The Federal Circuit af-\n  firmed.\nHeld: The Brooks Furniture framework is unduly rigid and impermissi-\n bly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district courts.\n Pp. 7–12.\n    (a) Section 285 imposes one and only one constraint on district\n courts’ discretion to award attorney’s fees: The power is reserved for\n “exceptional” cases. Because the Patent Act does not define “excep-\n tional,” the term is construed “in accordance with [its] ordinary\n meaning.” Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U. S. ___, ___. In 1952, when Con-\n gress used the word in §285 (and today, for that matter),\n “[e]xceptional” meant “uncommon,” “rare,” or “not ordinary.” Web-\n ster’s New International Dictionary 889 (2d ed. 1934). An “excep-\n tional” case, then, is simply one that stands out from others with re-\n2     OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    spect to the substantive strength of a party’s litigating position (con-\n    sidering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the un-\n    reasonable manner in which the case was litigated. District courts\n    may determine whether a case is “exceptional” in the case-by-case\n    exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circum-\n    stances. Cf. Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517. Pp. 7–8.\n       (b) The Brooks Furniture framework superimposes an inflexible\n    framework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible. Pp. 8–11.\n         (1) Brooks Furniture is too restrictive in defining the two catego-\n    ries of cases in which fee awards are allowed. The first category—\n    cases involving litigation or certain other misconduct—appears to ex-\n    tend largely to independently sanctionable conduct. But that is not\n    the appropriate benchmark. A district court may award fees in the\n    rare case in which a party’s unreasonable, though not independently\n    sanctionable, conduct is so “exceptional” as to justify an award. For\n    litigation to fall within the second category, a district court must de-\n    termine that the litigation is both objectively baseless and brought in\n    subjective bad faith. But a case presenting either subjective bad\n    faith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself\n    apart from mine-run cases to be “exceptional.” The Federal Circuit\n    imported this second category from Professional Real Estate Inves-\n    tors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49, but that\n    case’s standard finds no roots in §285’s text and makes little sense in\n    the context of the exceptional-case determination. Pp. 8–10.\n         (2) Brooks Furniture is so demanding that it would appear to\n    render §285 largely superfluous. Because courts already possess the\n    inherent power to award fees in cases involving misconduct or bad\n    faith, see Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S.\n    240, 258–259, this Court has declined to construe fee-shifting provi-\n    sions narrowly so as to avoid rendering them superfluous. See, e.g.,\n    Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 419. Pp. 10–11.\n         (3) Brooks Furniture’s requirement that proof of entitlement to\n    fees be made by clear and convincing evidence is not justified by\n    §285, which imposes no specific evidentiary burden. Nor has this\n    Court interpreted comparable fee-shifting statutes to require such a\n    burden of proof. See, e.g., Fogerty, 510 U. S, at 519. P. 11.\n496 Fed.

Rather, the “American Rule” governed:\n“ ‘[E]ach litigant pa[id] his own attorney’s fees, win or\nlose . . . .’ ” Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 9). In 1946, Congress amended the\nPatent Act to add a discretionary fee-shifting provision,\nthen codified in §70, which stated that a court “may in its\ndiscretion award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevail-\ning party upon the entry of judgment in any patent case.”\n35 U. S. C. §70 (1946 ed.).1\n    Courts did not award fees under §70 as a matter of\ncourse. They viewed the award of fees not “as a penalty\nfor failure to win a patent infringement suit,” but as ap-\npropriate “only in extraordinary circumstances.” Park-In-\nTheatres, Inc. v. Perkins, 190 F. 2d 137, 142 (CA9 1951).\nThe provision enabled them to address “unfairness or bad\nfaith in the conduct of the losing party, or some other\nequitable consideration of similar force,” which made a\ncase so unusual as to warrant fee-shifting. Ibid.; see also\nPennsylvania Crusher Co. v. Bethlehem Steel Co., 193 F.\n2d 445, 451 (CA3 1951) (listing as “adequate justifica-\ntion[s]” for fee awards “fraud practiced on the Patent\nOffice or vexatious or unjustified litigation”).\n    Six years later, Congress amended the fee-shifting\nprovision and recodified it as §285. Whereas §70 had\nspecified that a district court could “in its discretion award\nreasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party,” the\nrevised language of §285 (which remains in force today)\nprovides that “[t]he court in exceptional cases may award\nreasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.” We have\nobserved, in interpreting the damages provision of the\nPatent Act, that the addition of the phrase “exceptional\n\n\n——————\n  1 This provision did “not contemplat[e] that the recovery of attorney’s\n\nfees [would] become an ordinary thing in patent suits . . . .” S.

S. 648, 653,\nn. 8 (1983); see also id., at 652, n. 6. And the parties agree\nthat the recodification did not substantively alter the\nmeaning of the statute.3\n   For three decades after the enactment of §285, courts\napplied it—as they had applied §70—in a discretionary\nmanner, assessing various factors to determine whether a\ngiven case was sufficiently “exceptional” to warrant a fee\naward. See, e.g., True Temper Corp. v. CF&I Steel Corp.,\n601 F. 2d 495, 508–509 (CA10 1979); Kearney & Trecker\nCorp. v. Giddings & Lewis, Inc., 452 F. 2d 579, 597 (CA7\n1971); Siebring v.

In the two decades that followed, the\nFederal Circuit, like the regional circuits before it, in-\nstructed district courts to consider the totality of the cir-\ncumstances when making fee determinations under §285.\nSee, e.g., Rohm & Haas Co. v. Crystal Chemical Co., 736\nF. 2d 688, 691 (1984) (“Cases decided under §285 have\nnoted that ‘the substitution of the phrase “in exceptional\ncases” has not done away with the discretionary feature’ ”);\n——————\n  2 The Senate Report similarly explained that the new provision was\n\n“substantially the same as” §70, and that the “ ‘exceptional cases’ ”\nlanguage was added simply to “expres[s] the intention of the [1946]\nstatute as shown by its legislative history and as interpreted by the\ncourts.” S.

Danbury Phar­\nmacal, Inc., 231 F. 3d 1339, 1347 (2000) (“In assessing\nwhether a case qualifies as exceptional, the district court\nmust look at the totality of the circumstances”).\n   In 2005, however, the Federal Circuit abandoned that\nholistic, equitable approach in favor of a more rigid and\nmechanical formulation. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v.\nDutailier Int’l, Inc., 393 F. 3d 1378 (2005), the court held\nthat a case is “exceptional” under §285 only “when there\nhas been some material inappropriate conduct related to\nthe matter in litigation, such as willful infringement,\nfraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent,\nmisconduct during litigation, vexatious or unjustified\nlitigation, conduct that violates Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, or like\ninfractions.” Id., at 1381. “Absent misconduct in conduct\nof the litigation or in securing the patent,” the Federal\nCircuit continued, fees “may be imposed against the pa-\ntentee only if both (1) the litigation is brought in subjec-\ntive bad faith, and (2) the litigation is objectively base-\nless.” Ibid. The Federal Circuit subsequently clarified\nthat litigation is objectively baseless only if it is “so unrea-\nsonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it would\nsucceed,” iLOR, LLC v. Google, Inc., 631 F. 3d 1372, 1378\n(2011), and that litigation is brought in subjective bad\nfaith only if the plaintiff “actually know[s]” that it is objec-\ntively baseless, id., at 1377.4\n——————\n    4 In\n       Kilopass Technology, Inc. v.

The petitioner, Octane Fitness, LLC, also\nmanufactures exercise equipment, including elliptical\nmachines known as the Q45 and Q47.\n   ICON sued Octane, alleging that the Q45 and Q47\ninfringed several claims of the ’710 patent.

Apply-\ning the Brooks Furniture standard, the District Court\ndenied Octane’s motion. 2011 WL 3900975 (D Minn.,\nSept. 6, 2011). It determined that Octane could show\nneither that ICON’s claim was objectively baseless nor\nthat ICON had brought it in subjective bad faith.

The court also found no subjective\nbad faith on ICON’s part, dismissing as insufficient both\n“the fact that [ICON] is a bigger company which never\ncommercialized the ’710 patent” and an e-mail exchange\nbetween two ICON sales executives, which Octane had\noffered as evidence that ICON had brought the infringe-\nment action “as a matter of commercial strategy.”5 Id., *4.\n   ICON appealed the judgment of noninfringement, and\nOctane cross-appealed the denial of attorney’s fees. The\nFederal Circuit affirmed both orders. 496 Fed. Appx. 57\n(2012). In upholding the denial of attorney’s fees, it re-\njected Octane’s argument that the District Court had\n“applied an overly restrictive standard in refusing to find\nthe case exceptional under §285.” Id., at 65.

One of the recipients then forwarded\nthat e-mail to a third party, along with the accompanying message:\n“ ‘Just clearing the way and making sure you guys have all your guns\nloaded!’ ” Ibid. More than a year later, that same employee sent an\ne-mail to the Vice President of Global Sales with the subject, “ ‘I heard we\nare suing Octane!’ ” Ibid. The executive responded as follows: “ ‘Yes—\nold patent we had for a long time that was sitting on the shelf. They\nare just looking for royalties.’ ” Ibid. The District Court wrote that “in\nthe light most favorable to Octane, these remarks are stray comments\nby employees with no demonstrated connection to the lawsuit.” Ibid.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

Cloer, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6);\nsee also Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U. S. 593, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 6) (“In patent law, as in all statutory construction,\n‘[u]nless otherwise defined, “words will be interpreted as\ntaking their ordinary, contemporary, common mean-\ning” ’ ”). In 1952, when Congress used the word in §285\n(and today, for that matter), “[e]xceptional” meant “un-\ncommon,” “rare,” or “not ordinary.” Webster’s New Inter-\nnational Dictionary 889 (2d ed. 1934); see also 3 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 374 (1933) (defining “exceptional” as\n“out of the ordinary course,” “unusual,” or “special”);\nMerriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 435 (11th ed.\n2008) (defining “exceptional” as “rare”); Noxell Corp. v.\nFirehouse No. 1 Bar-B-Que Restaurant, 771 F. 2d 521, 526\n(CADC 1985) (R. B. Ginsburg, J., joined by Scalia, J.)\n(interpreting the term “exceptional” in the Lanham Act’s\nidentical fee-shifting provision, 15 U. S. C. §1117(a), to\nmean “uncommon” or “not run-of-the-mill”).\n   We hold, then, that an “exceptional” case is simply one\nthat stands out from others with respect to the substan-\ntive strength of a party’s litigating position (considering\n8     OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nboth the governing law and the facts of the case) or the\nunreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.\nDistrict courts may determine whether a case is “excep-\ntional” in the case-by-case exercise of their discretion,\nconsidering the totality of the circumstances.6 As in the\ncomparable context of the Copyright Act, “ ‘[t]here is no\nprecise rule or formula for making these determinations,’\nbut instead equitable discretion should be exercised ‘in\nlight of the considerations we have identified.’ ” Fogerty v.\nFantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517, 534 (1994).\n                                B\n                                1\n   The Federal Circuit’s formulation is overly rigid. Under\nthe standard crafted in Brooks Furniture, a case is “excep-\ntional” only if a district court either finds litigation-related\nmisconduct of an independently sanctionable magnitude\nor determines that the litigation was both “brought in\nsubjective bad faith” and “objectively baseless.” 393 F. 3d,\nat 1381. This formulation superimposes an inflexible\nframework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible.\n   For one thing, the first category of cases in which the\nFederal Circuit allows fee awards—those involving litiga-\ntion misconduct or certain other misconduct—appears to\nextend largely to independently sanctionable conduct. See\nibid. (defining litigation-related misconduct to include\n“willful infringement, fraud or inequitable conduct in\nprocuring the patent, misconduct during litigation, vexa-\n\n——————\n    6 In\n       Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517 (1994), for example, we\nexplained that in determining whether to award fees under a similar\nprovision in the Copyright Act, district courts could consider a “nonex-\nclusive” list of “factors,” including “frivolousness, motivation, objective\nunreasonableness (both in the factual and legal components of the case)\nand the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of\ncompensation and deterrence.” Id., at 534, n. 19 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

But sanctionable conduct\nis not the appropriate benchmark. Under the standard\nannounced today, a district court may award fees in the\nrare case in which a party’s unreasonable conduct—while\nnot necessarily independently sanctionable—is nonethe-\nless so “exceptional” as to justify an award of fees.\n   The second category of cases in which the Federal Cir-\ncuit allows fee awards is also too restrictive. In order for a\ncase to fall within this second category, a district court\nmust determine both that the litigation is objectively\nbaseless and that the plaintiff brought it in subjective bad\nfaith. But a case presenting either subjective bad faith or\nexceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself\napart from mine-run cases to warrant a fee award. Cf.\nNoxell, 771 F. 2d, at 526 (“[W]e think it fair to assume\nthat Congress did not intend rigidly to limit recovery of\nfees by a [Lanham Act] defendant to the rare case in\nwhich a court finds that the plaintiff ‘acted in bad faith,\nvexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons’ . . . .\nSomething less than ‘bad faith,’ we believe, suffices to\nmark a case as ‘exceptional’ ”).\n   ICON argues that the dual requirement of “subjective\nbad faith” and “objective baselessness” follows from this\nCourt’s decision in Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc.\nv. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49 (1993)\n(PRE), which involved an exception to the Noerr-\nPennington doctrine of antitrust law. It does not. Under\nthe Noerr-Pennington doctrine—established by Eastern\nRailroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight,\nInc., 365 U. S. 127 (1961), and Mine Workers v. Penning­\nton, 381 U. S. 657 (1965)—defendants are immune from\nantitrust liability for engaging in conduct (including litiga-\ntion) aimed at influencing decisionmaking by the govern-\nment. PRE, 508 U. S., at 56. But under a “sham excep-\ntion” to this doctrine, “activity ‘ostensibly directed toward\n10 OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH & FITNESS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninfluencing governmental action’ does not qualify for\nNoerr immunity if it ‘is a mere sham to cover . . . an at-\ntempt to interfere directly with the business relationships\nof a competitor.’ ” Id., at 51. In PRE, we held that to\nqualify as a “sham,” a “lawsuit must be objectively base-\nless” and must “concea[l] ‘an attempt to interfere directly\nwith the business relationships of a competitor . . . .’ ” Id.,\nat 60–61 (emphasis deleted). In other words, the plaintiff\nmust have brought baseless claims in an attempt to\nthwart competition (i.e., in bad faith).\n   In Brooks Furniture, the Federal Circuit imported the\nPRE standard into §285. See 393 F. 3d, at 1381. But the\nPRE standard finds no roots in the text of §285, and it\nmakes little sense in the context of determining whether a\ncase is so “exceptional” as to justify an award of attorney’s\nfees in patent litigation. We crafted the Noerr-Pennington\ndoctrine—and carved out only a narrow exception for\n“sham” litigation—to avoid chilling the exercise of the\nFirst Amendment right to petition the government for the\nredress of grievances. See PRE, 508 U. S., at 56 (“Those\nwho petition government for redress are generally im-\nmune from antitrust liability”). But to the extent that\npatent suits are similarly protected as acts of petitioning,\nit is not clear why the shifting of fees in an “exceptional”\ncase would diminish that right. The threat of antitrust\nliability (and the attendant treble damages, 15 U. S. C.\n§15) far more significantly chills the exercise of the right\nto petition than does the mere shifting of attorney’s fees.\nIn the Noerr-Pennington context, defendants seek immun-\nity from a judicial declaration that their filing of a lawsuit\nwas actually unlawful; here, they seek immunity from a\nfar less onerous declaration that they should bear the\ncosts of that lawsuit in exceptional cases.\n                           2\n  We reject Brooks Furniture for another reason: It is so\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndemanding that it would appear to render §285 largely\nsuperfluous. We have long recognized a common-law\nexception to the general “American rule” against fee-\nshifting—an exception, “inherent” in the “power [of] the\ncourts” that applies for “ ‘willful disobedience of a court\norder’ ” or “when the losing party has ‘acted in bad faith,\nvexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons . . . .’ ”\nAlyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421\nU. S. 240, 258–259 (1975). We have twice declined to\nconstrue fee-shifting provisions narrowly on the basis that\ndoing so would render them superfluous, given the back-\nground exception to the American rule, see Christiansburg\nGarment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 419 (1978); Newman\nv. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, 402, n. 4\n(1968) (per curiam), and we again decline to do so here.\n                              3\n   Finally, we reject the Federal Circuit’s requirement that\npatent litigants establish their entitlement to fees under\n§285 by “clear and convincing evidence,” Brooks Furniture,\n393 F. 3d, at 1382. We have not interpreted comparable\nfee-shifting statutes to require proof of entitlement to fees\nby clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., Fogerty, 510\nU. S., at 519; Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.\n384 (1990); Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558\n(1988). And nothing in §285 justifies such a high standard\nof proof. Section 285 demands a simple discretionary\ninquiry; it imposes no specific evidentiary burden, much\nless such a high one. Indeed, patent-infringement litiga-\ntion has always been governed by a preponderance of the\nevidence standard, see, e.g., Béné v. Jeantet, 129 U. S. 683,\n688 (1889), and that is the “standard generally applicable\nin civil actions,” because it “allows both parties to ‘share\nthe risk of error in roughly equal fashion,’ ” Herman &\nMacLean v.
