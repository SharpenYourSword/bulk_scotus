Argued February 26, 2014 —Decided April 29, 2014\nPetitioner Highmark Inc. moved for fees under the Patent Act’s fee-\n  shifting provision, which authorizes a district court to award attor-\n  ney’s fees to the prevailing party in “exceptional cases.” 35 U. S. C.\n  §285. The District Court found the case “exceptional” and granted\n  Highmark’s motion. The Federal Circuit, reviewing the District\n  Court’s determination de novo, reversed in part.\nHeld: All aspects of a district court’s exceptional-case determination\n under §285 should be reviewed for abuse of discretion. Prior to Oc-\n tane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., ante, p. ___, this\n determination was governed by the framework established by the\n Federal Circuit in Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc.,\n 393 F. 3d 1378. Octane rejects the Brooks Furniture framework as\n unduly rigid and holds that district courts may make the exceptional-\n case determination under §285 in the exercise of their discretion.\n The holding in Octane settles this case. Decisions on “matters of dis-\n cretion” are traditionally “reviewable for ‘abuse of discretion,’ ” Pierce\n v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558, and this Court previously has held\n that to be the proper standard of review in cases involving similar de-\n terminations, see, e.g., id., at 559; Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.,\n 496 U. S. 384, 405. The exceptional-case determination is based on\n statutory text that “emphasizes the fact that the determination is for\n the district court,” Pierce, 487 U. S., at 559; that court “is better posi-\n tioned” to make the determination, id., at 560; and the determination\n is “multifarious and novel,” not susceptible to “useful generalization”\n of the sort that de novo review provides, and “likely to profit from the\n experience that an abuse-of discretion rule will permit to develop,”\n id., at 562.

S. C. §285. In Brooks Furni-\nture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc., 393 F. 3d 1378\n(2005), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit interpreted §285 as authorizing fee awards only in\ntwo circumstances. It held that “[a] case may be deemed\nexceptional” under §285 “when there has been some mate-\nrial inappropriate conduct,” or when it is both “brought in\nsubjective bad faith” and “objectively baseless.” Id., at\n1381. We granted certiorari to determine whether an\nappellate court should accord deference to a district court’s\ndetermination that litigation is “objectively baseless.” On\nthe basis of our opinion in Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON\nHealth & Fitness, Inc., ante, p. ___, argued together with\nthis case and also issued today, we hold that an appellate\ncourt should review all aspects of a district court’s §285\ndetermination for abuse of discretion.\n                        I\n  Allcare Health Management System, Inc., owns U.

Highmark Inc., a health\ninsurance company, sued Allcare seeking a declaratory\njudgment that the ’105 patent was invalid and unenforce-\nable and that, to the extent it was valid, Highmark’s\nactions were not infringing it. Allcare counterclaimed for\npatent infringement. Both parties filed motions for sum-\nmary judgment, and the District Court entered a final\njudgment of noninfringement in favor of Highmark. The\nFederal Circuit affirmed. 329 Fed. Appx. 280 (2009) (per\ncuriam).\n   Highmark then moved for fees under §285. The District\nCourt granted Highmark’s motion. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2541965\"><a href=\"/txnd/e2CZ/highmark-v-allcare-health-management-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The court reasoned that Allcare had\nengaged in a pattern of “vexatious” and “deceitful” conduct\nthroughout the litigation. Id., at 737. Specifically, it\nfound that Allcare had “pursued this suit as part of a\nbigger plan to identify companies potentially infringing\nthe ’105 patent under the guise of an informational sur-\nvey, and then to force those companies to purchase a\nlicense of the ’105 patent under threat of litigation.” Id.,\nat 736–737. And it found that Allcare had “maintained\ninfringement claims [against Highmark] well after such\nclaims had been shown by its own experts to be without\nmerit” and had “asserted defenses it and its attorneys\nknew to be frivolous.” Id., at 737. In a subsequent opin-\nion, the District Court fixed the amount of the award at\n$4,694,727.40 in attorney’s fees and $209,626.56 in ex-\npenses, in addition to $375,400.05 in expert fees. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">6432945</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *7 (ND Tex., Nov. 5, 2010).\n   The Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in\n——————\n  1 “ ‘Utilization review’ is the process of determining whether a health\n\ninsurer should approve a particular treatment for a patient.” 687 F. 3d,\nat 1306.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

It affirmed the District Court’s\nexceptional-case determination with respect to the allega-\ntions that Highmark’s system infringed one claim of the\n’105 patent, id., at 1311–1313, but reversed the determi-\nnation with respect to another claim of the patent, id., at\n1313–1315. In reversing the exceptional-case determina-\ntion as to one claim, the court reviewed it de novo. The\ncourt held that because the question whether litigation is\n“objectively baseless” under Brooks Furniture “ ‘is a ques-\ntion of law based on underlying mixed questions of law\nand fact,’ ” an objective-baselessness determination is\nreviewed on appeal “ ‘de novo’ ” and “without deference.”\n687 F. 3d, at 1309; see also ibid., n. 1. It then determined,\ncontrary to the judgment of the District Court, that “All-\ncare’s argument” as to claim construction “was not ‘so\nunreasonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it\nwould succeed.’ ” Id., at 1315. The court further found\nthat none of Allcare’s conduct warranted an award of fees\nunder the litigation-misconduct prong of Brooks Furniture.\n687 F. 3d, at 1315–1319.\n   Judge Mayer dissented in part, disagreeing with the\nview “that no deference is owed to a district court’s finding\nthat the infringement claims asserted by a litigant at trial\nwere objectively unreasonable.” Id., at 1319. He would\nhave held that “reasonableness is a finding of fact which\nmay be set aside only for clear error.” Ibid. The Federal\nCircuit denied rehearing en banc, over the dissent of five\njudges. 701 F. 3d 1351 (2012). The dissenting judges\ncriticized the court’s decision to adopt a de novo standard\nof review for the “objectively baseless” determination as an\nimpermissible invasion of the province of the district\ncourt. Id., at 1357.\n   We granted certiorari, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), and now\nvacate and remand.\n4     HIGHMARK INC. v. ALLCARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT \n\n                        SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               II\n   Our opinion in Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health &\nFitness, Inc., rejects the Brooks Furniture framework as\nunduly rigid and inconsistent with the text of §285. It\nholds, instead, that the word “exceptional” in §285 should\nbe interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning.\nAnte, at 7. An “exceptional” case, it explains, “is simply\none that stands out from others with respect to the sub-\nstantive strength of a party’s litigating position (consider-\ning both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the\nunreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.”\nAnte, at 7–8. And it instructs that “[d]istrict courts may\ndetermine whether a case is ‘exceptional’ in the case-by-\ncase exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of\nthe circumstances.” Ante, at 8. Our holding in Octane\nsettles this case: Because §285 commits the determination\nwhether a case is “exceptional” to the discretion of the\ndistrict court, that decision is to be reviewed on appeal for\nabuse of discretion.\n   Traditionally, decisions on “questions of law” are “re-\nviewable de novo,” decisions on “questions of fact” are\n“reviewable for clear error,” and decisions on “matters of\ndiscretion” are “reviewable for ‘abuse of discretion.’ ”\nPierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558 (1988). For rea-\nsons we explain in Octane, the determination whether a\ncase is “exceptional” under §285 is a matter of discretion.\nAnd as in our prior cases involving similar determina-\ntions, the exceptional-case determination is to be reviewed\nonly for abuse of discretion.2 See Pierce, 487 U. S., at 559\n(determinations whether a litigating position is “substan-\n\n——————\n  2 The abuse-of-discretion standard does not preclude an appellate\n\ncourt’s correction of a district court’s legal or factual error: “A district\ncourt would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an\nerroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the\nevidence.” Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 405 (1990).\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.\n384, 405 (1990) (sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 11 are to be reviewed for abuse of discretion).\n   As in Pierce, the text of the statute “emphasizes the fact\nthat the determination is for the district court,” which\n“suggests some deference to the district court upon ap-\npeal,” 487 U. S., at 559. As in Pierce, “as a matter of the\nsound administration of justice,” the district court “is\nbetter positioned” to decide whether a case is exceptional,\nid., at 559–560, because it lives with the case over a pro-\nlonged period of time. And as in Pierce, the question is\n“multifarious and novel,” not susceptible to “useful gener-\nalization” of the sort that de novo review provides, and\n“likely to profit from the experience that an abuse-of-\ndiscretion rule will permit to develop,” id., at 562.\n   We therefore hold that an appellate court should apply\nan abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of\na district court’s §285 determination. Although questions\nof law may in some cases be relevant to the §285 inquiry,\nthat inquiry generally is, at heart, “rooted in factual de-\nterminations,” Cooter, 496 U. S., at 401.\n                        *    *     *\n  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 2671724, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/04/29/highmark_inc._v._allcare_health_management_system_inc..pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

It then determined,\ncontrary to the judgment of the District Court, that “All-\ncare’s argument” as to claim construction “was not ‘so\nunreasonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it\nwould succeed.’ ” Id., at 1315. The court further found\nthat none of Allcare’s conduct warranted an award of fees\nunder the litigation-misconduct prong of Brooks Furniture.\n687 F. 3d, at 1315–1319.\n   Judge Mayer dissented in part, disagreeing with the\nview “that no deference is owed to a district court’s finding\nthat the infringement claims asserted by a litigant at trial\nwere objectively unreasonable.” Id., at 1319. He would\nhave held that “reasonableness is a finding of fact which\nmay be set aside only for clear error.” Ibid. The Federal\nCircuit denied rehearing en banc, over the dissent of five\njudges. 701 F. 3d 1351 (2012). The dissenting judges\ncriticized the court’s decision to adopt a de novo standard\nof review for the “objectively baseless” determination as an\nimpermissible invasion of the province of the district\ncourt. Id., at 1357.\n   We granted certiorari, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), and now\nvacate and remand.\n4     HIGHMARK INC. v. ALLCARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT \n\n                        SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               II\n   Our opinion in Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health &\nFitness, Inc., rejects the Brooks Furniture framework as\nunduly rigid and inconsistent with the text of §285. It\nholds, instead, that the word “exceptional” in §285 should\nbe interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning.\nAnte, at 7. An “exceptional” case, it explains, “is simply\none that stands out from others with respect to the sub-\nstantive strength of a party’s litigating position (consider-\ning both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the\nunreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.”\nAnte, at 7–8. And it instructs that “[d]istrict courts may\ndetermine whether a case is ‘exceptional’ in the case-by-\ncase exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of\nthe circumstances.” Ante, at 8. Our holding in Octane\nsettles this case: Because §285 commits the determination\nwhether a case is “exceptional” to the discretion of the\ndistrict court, that decision is to be reviewed on appeal for\nabuse of discretion.\n   Traditionally, decisions on “questions of law” are “re-\nviewable de novo,” decisions on “questions of fact” are\n“reviewable for clear error,” and decisions on “matters of\ndiscretion” are “reviewable for ‘abuse of discretion.’ ”\nPierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558 (1988). For rea-\nsons we explain in Octane, the determination whether a\ncase is “exceptional” under §285 is a matter of discretion.\nAnd as in our prior cases involving similar determina-\ntions, the exceptional-case determination is to be reviewed\nonly for abuse of discretion.2 See Pierce, 487 U. S., at 559\n(determinations whether a litigating position is “substan-\n\n——————\n  2 The abuse-of-discretion standard does not preclude an appellate\n\ncourt’s correction of a district court’s legal or factual error: “A district\ncourt would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an\nerroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the\nevidence.” Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 405 (1990).\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntially justified” for purposes of fee-shifting under the\nEqual Access to Justice Act are to be reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion); Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.\n384, 405 (1990) (sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 11 are to be reviewed for abuse of discretion).\n   As in Pierce, the text of the statute “emphasizes the fact\nthat the determination is for the district court,” which\n“suggests some deference to the district court upon ap-\npeal,” 487 U. S., at 559. As in Pierce, “as a matter of the\nsound administration of justice,” the district court “is\nbetter positioned” to decide whether a case is exceptional,\nid., at 559–560, because it lives with the case over a pro-\nlonged period of time. And as in Pierce, the question is\n“multifarious and novel,” not susceptible to “useful gener-\nalization” of the sort that de novo review provides, and\n“likely to profit from the experience that an abuse-of-\ndiscretion rule will permit to develop,” id., at 562.\n   We therefore hold that an appellate court should apply\nan abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of\na district court’s §285 determination. Although questions\nof law may in some cases be relevant to the §285 inquiry,\nthat inquiry generally is, at heart, “rooted in factual de-\nterminations,” Cooter, 496 U. S., at 401.\n                        *    *     *\n  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2671724/", "sha1": "444027d5ade8416007a94f1a5c5d09d0aa640d1d", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-041", "time_retrieved": "2014-04-29T17:02:33.780964"}
