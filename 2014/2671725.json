Argued December 10, 2013—Decided April 29, 2014*\nCongress and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency)\n  have, over the course of several decades, made many efforts to deal\n  with the complex challenge of curtailing air pollution emitted in up-\n  wind States, but causing harm in other, downwind States. As rele-\n  vant here, the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) directs EPA to establish\n  national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for pollutants at\n  levels that will protect public health. 42 U. S. C. §§7408, 7409. Once\n  EPA settles on a NAAQS, the Agency must designate “nonattain-\n  ment” areas, i.e., locations where the concentration of a regulated pol-\n  lutant exceeds the NAAQS. §7407(d). Each State must submit a\n  State Implementation Plan, or SIP, to EPA within three years of any\n  new or revised NAAQS. §7410(a)(1). From the date EPA determines\n  that a State SIP is inadequate, the Agency has two years to promul-\n  gate a Federal Implementation Plan, or FIP. §7410(c)(1). Among\n  other components, the CAA mandates SIP compliance with the Good\n  Neighbor Provision, which requires SIPs to “contain adequate provi-\n  sions . . . prohibiting . . . any source or other type of emissions activity\n  within the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which\n  will . . . contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with\n  maintenance by, any other State with respect to any . . . [NAAQS].”\n  §7410(a)(2)(D)(i).\n     Several times over the past two decades, EPA has attempted to\n  delineate the Good Neighbor Provision’s scope by identifying when\n——————\n  * Together with No. 12–1183, American Lung Association et al. v.\nEME Homer City Generation, L. P., et al., also on certiorari to the same\ncourt.\n2            EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    upwind States “contribute significantly” to nonattainment downwind.\n    The D. C. Circuit found fault with the Agency’s 2005 attempt, the\n    Clean Air Interstate Rule, or CAIR, which regulated both nitrogen\n    oxide (NOX) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, the gasses at issue\n    here. The D. C. Circuit nevertheless left CAIR temporarily in place,\n    while encouraging EPA to act with dispatch in dealing with problems\n    the court had identified.\n       EPA’s response to that decision is the Cross-State Air Pollution\n    Rule (Transport Rule), which curbs NOX and SO2 emissions in 27 up-\n    wind States to achieve downwind attainment of three NAAQS. Un-\n    der the Transport Rule, an upwind State “contribute[d] significantly”\n    to downwind nonattainment to the extent its exported pollution both\n    (1) produced one percent or more of a NAAQS in at least one down-\n    wind State and (2) could be eliminated cost-effectively, as determined\n    by EPA. Upwind States are obliged to eliminate only emissions\n    meeting both of these criteria. Through complex modeling, EPA cre-\n    ated an annual emissions “budget” for each regulated State upwind,\n    representing the total quantity of pollution an upwind State could\n    produce in a given year under the Transport Rule. Having earlier de-\n    termined each regulated State’s SIP to be inadequate, EPA, contem-\n    poraneous with the Transport Rule, promulgated FIPs allocating\n    each State’s emissions budgets among its in-state pollution sources.\n       A group of state and local governments (State respondents), joined\n    by industry and labor groups (Industry respondents), petitioned for\n    review of the Transport Rule in the D. C. Circuit. The court vacated\n    the rule in its entirety, holding that EPA’s actions exceeded the\n    Agency’s statutory authority in two respects. Acknowledging that\n    EPA’s FIP authority is generally triggered when the Agency disap-\n    proves a SIP, the court was nevertheless concerned that States would\n    be incapable of fulfilling the Good Neighbor Provision without prior\n    EPA guidance. The court thus concluded that EPA must give States\n    a reasonable opportunity to allocate their emission budgets before is-\n    suing FIPs. The court also found the Agency’s two-part interpreta-\n    tion of the Good Neighbor Provision unreasonable, concluding that\n    EPA must disregard costs and consider exclusively each upwind\n    State’s physically proportionate responsibility for air quality prob-\n    lems downwind.\nHeld:\n    1. The CAA does not command that States be given a second oppor-\n tunity to file a SIP after EPA has quantified the State’s interstate\n pollution obligations. Pp. 13–18.\n       (a) The State respondents do not challenge EPA’s disapproval of\n any particular SIP. Instead, they argue that, notwithstanding these\n disapprovals, the Agency was still obliged to grant upwind States an\n                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nadditional opportunity to promulgate adequate SIPs after EPA had\nset the State’s emission budget. This claim does not turn on the va-\nlidity of the prior SIP disapprovals, but on whether the CAA requires\nEPA do more than disapprove a SIP to trigger the Agency’s authority\nto issue a FIP. Pp. 13–14.\n      (b) The CAA’s plain text supports the Agency: Disapproval of a\nSIP, without more, triggers EPA’s obligation to issue a FIP. The\nstatute sets precise deadlines for the States and EPA. Once EPA is-\nsues any new or revised NAAQS, a State “shall” propose a SIP within\nthree years, 42 U. S. C. §7410(a)(1), and that SIP “shall” include, in-\nter alia, provisions adequate to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision,\n§7410(a)(2). If the EPA finds a SIP inadequate, the Agency has a\nstatutory duty to issue a FIP “at any time” within two years.\n§7410(c)(1). However sensible the D. C. Circuit’s exception to this\nstrict time prescription may be, a reviewing court’s “task is to apply\nthe text [of the statute], not to improve upon it.” Pavelic & LeFlore v.\nMarvel Entertainment Group, Div. of Cadence Industries Corp., 493\nU. S. 120, 126. Nothing in the Act differentiates the Good Neighbor\nProvision from the several other matters a State must address in its\nSIP. Nor does the Act condition the duty to promulgate a FIP on\nEPA’s having first quantified an upwind State’s good neighbor obliga-\ntions. By altering Congress’ SIP and FIP schedule, the D. C. Circuit\nallowed a delay Congress did not order and placed an information\nsubmission obligation on EPA Congress did not impose. Pp. 14–17.\n      (c) The fact that EPA had previously accorded upwind States a\nchance to allocate emission budgets among their in-state sources does\nnot show that the Agency acted arbitrarily by refraining to do so\nhere. EPA retained discretion to alter its course provided it gave a\nreasonable explanation for doing so. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of\nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S.\n29, 42. Here, the Agency had been admonished by the D. C. Circuit\nto act with dispatch in amending or replacing CAIR. Endeavoring to\nsatisfy that directive, EPA acted speedily, issuing FIPs and the\nTransport Rule contemporaneously. Pp. 17–18.\n   2. EPA’s cost-effective allocation of emission reductions among up-\nwind States is a permissible, workable, and equitable interpretation\nof the Good Neighbor Provision. Pp. 18–31.\n      (a) Respondents’ attack on EPA’s interpretation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision is not foreclosed by §7607(d)(7)(B), which pro-\nvides that “[o]nly an objection to a rule . . . raised with reasonable\nspecificity during the period for public comment . . . may be raised\nduring judicial review.” Even assuming that respondents failed to\nobject to the Transport Rule with “reasonable specificity,” that lapse\nis not jurisdictional. Section 7607(d)(7)(B) is a “mandatory,” but not\n4            EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    “jurisdictional,” rule, see Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 510,\n    which speaks to a party’s procedural obligations, not a court’s author-\n    ity, see Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455. Because EPA did not\n    press this argument unequivocally before the D. C. Circuit, it does\n    not pose an impassable hindrance to this Court’s review. Pp. 18–19.\n         (b) This Court routinely accords dispositive effect to an agency’s\n    reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutory language. The\n    Good Neighbor Provision delegates authority to EPA at least as cer-\n    tainly as the CAA provisions involved in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\n    Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. EPA’s au-\n    thority to reduce upwind pollution extends only to those “amounts” of\n    pollution that “contribute significantly to nonattainment” in down-\n    wind States. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i). Because a downwind State’s excess\n    pollution is often caused by multiple upwind States, however, EPA\n    must address how to allocate responsibility among multiple contribu-\n    tors. The Good Neighbor Provision does not dictate a method of ap-\n    portionment. Nothing in the provision, for example, directs the pro-\n    portional allocation method advanced by the D. C. Circuit, a method\n    that works neither mathematically nor in practical application. Un-\n    der Chevron, Congress’ silence effectively delegates authority to EPA\n    to select from among reasonable options. See United States v. Mead\n    Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229.\n       EPA’s chosen allocation method is a “permissible construction of\n    the statute.” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843. The Agency, tasked with\n    choosing which among equal “amounts” to eliminate, has chosen sen-\n    sibly to reduce the amount easier, i.e., less costly, to eradicate. The\n    Industry respondents argue that the final calculation cannot rely on\n    costs, but nothing in the Good Neighbor Provision’s text precludes\n    that choice. And using costs in the Transport Rule calculus is an effi-\n    cient and equitable solution to the allocation problem the Good\n    Neighbor Provision compels the Agency to address. Efficient because\n    EPA can achieve the same levels of attainment, i.e., of emission re-\n    ductions, the proportional approach aims to achieve, but at a much\n    lower overall cost. Equitable because, by imposing uniform cost\n    thresholds on regulated States, EPA’s rule subjects to stricter regula-\n    tion those States that have done less in the past to control their pol-\n    lution. Pp. 20–28.\n         (c) Wholesale invalidation of the Transport Rule is not justified\n    by either of the D. C. Circuit’s remaining objections: that the\n    Transport Rule leaves open the possibility that a State might be\n    compelled to reduce emissions beyond the point at which every af-\n    fected downwind State is in attainment, so-called “over-control”; and\n    that EPA’s use of costs does not foreclose the possibility that an up-\n    wind State would be required to reduce its emissions by so much that\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     5\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  the State would be placed below the one-percent mark EPA set as the\n  initial threshold of “significan[ce].” First, instances of “over-control”\n  in particular downwind locations may be incidental to reductions\n  necessary to ensure attainment elsewhere. As the Good Neighbor\n  Provision seeks attainment in every downwind State, however, ex-\n  ceeding attainment in one State cannot rank as “over-control” unless\n  unnecessary to achieving attainment in any downwind State. Sec-\n  ond, the EPA must have leeway in fulfilling its statutory mandate to\n  balance the possibilities of over-control and “under-control,” i.e., to\n  maximize achievement of attainment downwind. Finally, in a volu-\n  minous record, involving thousands of upwind-to-downwind linkages,\n  respondents point to only a few instances of “unnecessary” emission\n  reductions, and even those are contested by EPA.

Left unregulated,\nthe emitting or upwind State reaps the benefits of the\neconomic activity causing the pollution without bearing all\nthe costs. See Revesz, Federalism and Interstate Envi­\nronmental Externalities, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2341, 2343\n(1996). Conversely, downwind States to which the pollu­\ntion travels are unable to achieve clean air because of the\ninflux of out-of-state pollution they lack authority to con­\ntrol. See S. Rep. No. 101–228, p. 49 (1989). To tackle the\n2        EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproblem, Congress included a Good Neighbor Provision in\nthe Clean Air Act (Act or CAA). That provision, in its\ncurrent phrasing, instructs States to prohibit in-state\nsources “from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which\nwill . . . contribute significantly” to downwind States’\n“nonattainment . . . , or interfere with maintenance,” of\nany EPA-promulgated national air quality standard. 42\nU. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i).\n   Interpreting the Good Neighbor Provision, EPA adopted\nthe Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (commonly and herein­\nafter called the Transport Rule). The rule calls for consid­\neration of costs, among other factors, when determining\nthe emission reductions an upwind State must make to\nimprove air quality in polluted downwind areas. The\nCourt of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit vacated the rule in\nits entirety. It held, 2 to 1, that the Good Neighbor Provi­\nsion requires EPA to consider only each upwind State’s\nphysically proportionate responsibility for each downwind\nState’s air quality problem. That reading is demanded,\naccording to the D. C. Circuit, so that no State will be\nrequired to decrease its emissions by more than its ratable\nshare of downwind-state pollution.\n   In Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), we reversed a D. C.\nCircuit decision that failed to accord deference to EPA’s\nreasonable interpretation of an ambiguous Clean Air Act\nprovision. Satisfied that the Good Neighbor Provision\ndoes not command the Court of Appeals’ cost-blind con­\nstruction, and that EPA reasonably interpreted the provi­\nsion, we reverse the D. C. Circuit’s judgment.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  Air pollution is transient, heedless of state boundaries.\nPollutants generated by upwind sources are often trans­\nported by air currents, sometimes over hundreds of miles,\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nto downwind States. As the pollution travels out of state,\nupwind States are relieved of the associated costs. Those\ncosts are borne instead by the downwind States, whose\nability to achieve and maintain satisfactory air quality is\nhampered by the steady stream of infiltrating pollution.\n   For several reasons, curtailing interstate air pollution\nposes a complex challenge for environmental regulators.\nFirst, identifying the upwind origin of downwind air pollu­\ntion is no easy endeavor. Most upwind States propel\npollutants to more than one downwind State, many\ndownwind States receive pollution from multiple upwind\nStates, and some States qualify as both upwind and\ndownwind. See Brief for Federal Petitioners 6. The over­\nlapping and interwoven linkages between upwind and\ndownwind States with which EPA had to contend number\nin the thousands.1\n   Further complicating the problem, pollutants do not\nemerge from the smokestacks of an upwind State and\nuniformly migrate downwind. Some pollutants stay with­\nin upwind States’ borders, the wind carries others to\ndownwind States, and some subset of that group drifts to\nStates without air quality problems. “The wind bloweth\nwhere it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but\ncanst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.”\nThe Holy Bible, John 3:8 (King James Version). In craft­\ning a solution to the problem of interstate air pollution,\nregulators must account for the vagaries of the wind.\n   Finally, upwind pollutants that find their way down­\nwind are not left unaltered by the journey. Rather, as the\ngases emitted by upwind polluters are carried downwind,\nthey are transformed, through various chemical processes,\ninto altogether different pollutants. The offending gases\n——————\n  1 For the rule challenged here, EPA evaluated 2,479 separate link­\n\nages between downwind and upwind States. Brief for Federal Petition­\ners 6.\n4        EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat issue in these cases—nitrogen oxide (NOX) and sulfur\ndioxide (SO2)—often develop into ozone and fine particu­\nlate matter (PM2.5) by the time they reach the atmos­\npheres of downwind States. See 76 Fed. Reg. 48222–\n48223 (2011). See also 69 Fed. Reg. 4575–4576 (2004)\n(describing the components of ozone and PM2.5). Down­\nwind air quality must therefore be measured for ozone and\nPM2.5 concentrations. EPA’s chore is to quantify the\namount of upwind gases (NOX and SO2) that must be\nreduced to enable downwind States to keep their levels of\nozone and PM2.5 in check.\n                               B\n   Over the past 50 years, Congress has addressed inter­\nstate air pollution several times and with increasing rigor.\nIn 1963, Congress directed federal authorities to “encour­\nage cooperative activities by the States and local govern­\nments for the prevention and control of air pollution.” 77\nStat. 393, 42 U. S. C. §1857a (1964 ed.). In 1970, Congress\nmade this instruction more concrete, introducing features\nstill key to the Act. For the first time, Congress directed\nEPA to establish national ambient air quality standards\n(NAAQS) for pollutants at levels that will protect public\nhealth. See 84 Stat. 1679–1680, as amended, 42 U. S. C.\n§§7408, 7409 (2006 ed.). Once EPA settles on a NAAQS,\nthe Act requires the Agency to designate “nonattainment”\nareas, i.e., locations where the concentration of a regulated\npollutant exceeds the NAAQS. §7407(d).\n   The Act then shifts the burden to States to propose\nplans adequate for compliance with the NAAQS. Each\nState must submit a State Implementation Plan, or SIP,\nto EPA within three years of any new or revised NAAQS.\n§7410(a)(1). If EPA determines that a State has failed to\nsubmit an adequate SIP, either in whole or in part, the Act\nrequires the Agency to promulgate a Federal Implementa­\ntion Plan, or FIP, within two years of EPA’s determina­\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntion, “unless the State corrects the deficiency” before a FIP\nis issued. §7410(c)(1).2\n   The Act lists the matters a SIP must cover. Among SIP\ncomponents, the 1970 version of the Act required SIPs to\ninclude “adequate provisions for intergovernmental coop­\neration” concerning interstate air pollution. §110(a)(2)(E),\n84 Stat. 1681, 42 U. S. C. §1857c–5(a)(2)(E). This statutory\nrequirement, with its text altered over time, has come\nto be called the Good Neighbor Provision.\n   In 1977, Congress amended the Good Neighbor Provi­\nsion to require more than “cooperation.” It directed States\nto submit SIPs that included provisions “adequate” to\n“prohibi[t] any stationary source within the State from\nemitting any air pollutant in amounts which will . . .\nprevent attainment or maintenance [of air quality stand­\nards] by any other State.” §108(a)(4), 91 Stat. 693, 42\nU. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(E) (1976 ed., Supp. II). The amended\nprovision thus explicitly instructed upwind States to\nreduce emissions to account for pollution exported beyond\ntheir borders. As then written, however, the provision\nregulated only individual sources that, considered alone,\nemitted enough pollution to cause nonattainment in a\ndownwind State. Because it is often “impossible to say\nthat any single source or group of sources is the one which\nactually prevents attainment” downwind, S. Rep. No. 101–\n228, p. 21 (1989), the 1977 version of the Good Neighbor\nProvision proved ineffective, see ibid. (noting the provi­\nsion’s inability to curb the collective “emissions [of] multi­\nple sources”).\n   Congress most recently amended the Good Neighbor\nProvision in 1990. The statute, in its current form, re­\nquires SIPs to “contain adequate provisions . . . prohibiting\n——————\n  2 FIPs and SIPs were introduced in the 1970 version of the Act; the\n\nparticular deadlines discussed here were added in 1990.

The controversy before us centers on EPA’s\nmost recent attempt to construe this provision.\n                             C\n   Three times over the past two decades, EPA has at­\ntempted to delineate the Good Neighbor Provision’s scope\nby identifying when upwind States “contribute significantly”\nto nonattainment downwind. In 1998, EPA issued a\nrule known as the “NOX SIP Call.” That regulation lim­\nited NOX emissions in 23 upwind States to the extent such\nemissions contributed to nonattainment of ozone stand­\nards in downwind States. See 63 Fed. Reg. 57356, 57358.\nIn Michigan v. EPA, 213 F. 3d 663 (2000), the D. C. Cir­\ncuit upheld the NOX SIP Call, specifically affirming EPA’s\nuse of costs to determine when an upwind State’s contri­\nbution was “significan[t]” within the meaning of the stat­\nute. Id., at 674–679.\n   In 2005, EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule, or\nCAIR. 70 Fed. Reg. 25162. CAIR regulated both NOX and\nSO2 emissions, insofar as such emissions contributed to\ndownwind nonattainment of two NAAQS, both set in 1997,\none concerning the permissible annual measure of PM2.5,\nand another capping the average ozone level gauged over\nan 8-hour period. See id., at 25171. The D. C. Circuit\ninitially vacated CAIR as arbitrary and capricious. See\nNorth Carolina v. EPA, 531 F. 3d 896, 921 (2008) (per\ncuriam). On rehearing, the court decided to leave the rule\nin place, while encouraging EPA to act with dispatch in\ndealing with problems the court had identified. See North\nCarolina v. EPA, 550 F. 3d 1176, 1178 (2008) (per curiam).\n   The rule challenged here—the Transport Rule—is EPA’s\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nresponse to the D. C. Circuit’s North Carolina decision.\nFinalized in August 2011, the Transport Rule curtails NOX\nand SO2 emissions of 27 upwind States to achieve down­\nwind attainment of three different NAAQS: the two 1997\nNAAQS previously addressed by CAIR, and the 2006\nNAAQS for PM2.5 levels measured on a daily basis. See 76\nFed. Reg. 48208–48209.\n   Under the Transport Rule, EPA employed a “two-step\napproach” to determine when upwind States “contribute[d]\nsignificantly to nonattainment,” id., at 48254, and there­\nfore in “amounts” that had to be eliminated. At step one,\ncalled the “screening” analysis, the Agency excluded as de\nminimis any upwind State that contributed less than one\npercent of the three NAAQS3 to any downwind State\n“receptor,” a location at which EPA measures air quality.\nSee id., at 48236–48237.4 If all of an upwind State’s con­\ntributions fell below the one-percent threshold, that State\nwould be considered not to have “contribute[d] signifi-\ncantly” to the nonattainment of any downwind State. Id.,\nat 48236. States in that category were screened out and\nexempted from regulation under the rule.\n   The remaining States were subjected to a second in­\nquiry, which EPA called the “control” analysis. At this\nstage, the Agency sought to generate a cost-effective allo­\ncation of emission reductions among those upwind States\n“screened in” at step one.\n   The control analysis proceeded this way. EPA first\ncalculated, for each upwind State, the quantity of emis­\nsions the State could eliminate at each of several cost\n——————\n  3 With respect to each NAAQS addressed by the rule, the one-percent\n\nthreshold corresponded to levels of 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter\n(µg/m3) for annual PM2.5, 0.35 µg/m3 for daily PM2.5, and 0.8 parts per\nbillion (ppb) for 8-hour ozone. See 76 Fed. Reg. 48236–48237.\n  4 If, for example, the NAAQS for ozone were 100 ppb, a contribution of\n\nless than 1 ppb to any downwind location would fall outside EPA’s\ncriteria for significance.\n8          EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthresholds. See id., at 48248–48249. Cost for these pur­\nposes is measured as cost per ton of emissions prevented,\nfor instance, by installing scrubbers on powerplant smoke­\nstacks.5 EPA estimated, for example, the amount each\nupwind State’s NOX emissions would fall if all pollution\nsources within each State employed every control measure\navailable at a cost of $500 per ton or less. See id., at\n48249–48251. The Agency then repeated that analysis at\nascending cost thresholds. See ibid.6\n  Armed with this information, EPA conducted complex\nmodeling to establish the combined effect the upwind\nreductions projected at each cost threshold would have on\nair quality in downwind States. See id., at 48249. The\nAgency then identified “significant cost threshold[s],”\npoints in its model where a “noticeable change occurred in\ndownwind air quality, such as . . . where large upwind\nemission reductions become available because a certain\ntype of emissions control strategy becomes cost-effective.”\nIbid. For example, reductions of NOX sufficient to resolve\nor significantly curb downwind air quality problems could\nbe achieved, EPA determined, at a cost threshold of $500\nper ton (applied uniformly to all regulated upwind States).\n“Moving beyond the $500 cost threshold,” EPA concluded,\n“would result in only minimal additional . . . reductions [in\nemissions].” Id., at 48256.7\n  Finally, EPA translated the cost thresholds it had se­\n——————\n    5 Toillustrate, a technology priced at $5,000 and capable of eliminat­\ning two tons of pollution would be stated to “cost” $2,500 per ton.\n   6 For SO2, EPA modeled reductions that would be achieved at cost\n\nlevels of $500, $1,600, $2,300, $2,800, $3,300, and $10,000 per ton\neliminated. See id., at 48251–48253.\n   7 For SO2, EPA determined that, for one group of upwind States, all\n\ndownwind air quality problems would be resolved at the $500 per ton\nthreshold. See id., at 48257. For another group of States, however,\nthis level of controls would not suffice. For those States, EPA found\nthat pollution controls costing $2,300 per ton were necessary. See id.,\nat 48259.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlected into amounts of emissions upwind States would be\nrequired to eliminate. For each regulated upwind State,\nEPA created an annual emissions “budget.” These budg­\nets represented the quantity of pollution an upwind State\nwould produce in a given year if its in-state sources im­\nplemented all pollution controls available at the chosen\ncost thresholds. See id., at 48249.8 If EPA’s projected\nimprovements to downwind air quality were to be realized,\nan upwind State’s emissions could not exceed the level this\nbudget allocated to it, subject to certain adjustments not\nrelevant here.\n   Taken together, the screening and control inquiries\ndefined EPA’s understanding of which upwind emissions\nwere within the Good Neighbor Provision’s ambit. In\nshort, under the Transport Rule, an upwind State “con­\ntribute[d] significantly” to downwind nonattainment to the\nextent its exported pollution both (1) produced one percent\nor more of a NAAQS in at least one downwind State (step\none) and (2) could be eliminated cost-effectively, as deter­\nmined by EPA (step two). See id., at 48254. Upwind\nStates would be obliged to eliminate all and only emis­\nsions meeting both of these criteria.9\n   For each State regulated by the Transport Rule, EPA\ncontemporaneously promulgated a FIP allocating that\nState’s emission budget among its in-state sources. See\nid., at 48271, 48284–48287.10 For each of these States,\n——————\n  8 In  2014, for example, pollution sources within Texas would be per­\nmitted to emit no more than 243,954 tons of SO2, subject to variations\nspecified by EPA. See id., at 48269 (Table VI.F–1).\n   9 Similarly, upwind States EPA independently determined to be “in­\n\nterfer[ing] with [the] maintenance” of NAAQS downwind were required\nto eliminate pollution only to the extent their emissions satisfied both\nof these criteria. See id., at 48254.\n   10 These FIPs specified the maximum amount of pollution each in­\n\nstate pollution source could emit. Sources below this ceiling could sell\nunused “allocations” to sources that could not reduce emissions to the\nnecessary level as cheaply. See id., at 48271–48272.

P.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nEPA had determined that the State had failed to submit\na SIP adequate for compliance with the Good Neighbor\nProvision. These determinations regarding SIPs became\nfinal after 60 days, see 42 U. S. C. §7607(b)(1)(2006 ed.,\nSupp. V ), and many went unchallenged.11 EPA views the\nSIP determinations as having triggered its statutory\nobligation to promulgate a FIP within two years, see\n§7410(c), a view contested by respondents, see Part II,\ninfra.\n                              D\n  A group of state and local governments (State respond­\nents), joined by industry and labor groups (Industry re­\nspondents), petitioned for review of the Transport Rule in\nthe U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit. Over the\ndissent of Judge Rogers, the Court of Appeals vacated the\nrule in its entirety. See 696 F. 3d 7, 37 (2012).\n  EPA’s actions, the appeals court held, exceeded the\nAgency’s statutory authority in two respects. By promul­\ngating FIPs before giving States a meaningful opportunity\nto adopt their own implementation plans, EPA had, in the\ncourt’s view, upset the CAA’s division of responsibility\nbetween the States and the Federal Government. In the\nmain, the Court of Appeals acknowledged, EPA’s FIP\nauthority is triggered at the moment the Agency disap­\nproves a SIP. See id., at 30. Thus, when a State proposes\n——————\nand-trade” system cuts costs while still reducing pollution to target\nlevels.\n  11 Three States did challenge EPA’s determinations. See Petition for\n\nReview in Ohio v. EPA, No. 11–3988 (CA6); Petition for Review in\nKansas v. EPA, No. 12–1019 (CADC); Notice in Georgia v. EPA, No. 11–\n1427 (CADC). Those challenges were not consolidated with this pro­\nceeding, and they remain pending (held in abeyance for these cases) in\nthe Sixth and D. C. Circuits. See Twelfth Joint Status Report in Ohio\nv. EPA, No. 11–3988 (CA6); Order in Kansas v. EPA, No. 11–1333\n(CADC, May 10, 2013); Order in Georgia v.

See\nid., at 32.\n   But the Court of Appeals ruled that a different regime\napplies to a State’s failure to meet its obligations under\nthe Good Neighbor Provision. While a NAAQS was a\n“clear numerical target,” a State’s good neighbor obligation\nremained “nebulous and unknown,” the court observed,\nuntil EPA calculated the State’s emission budget. Ibid.\nWithout these budgets, the Court of Appeals said, upwind\nStates would be compelled to take a “stab in the dark” at\ncalculating their own significant contribution to interstate\nair pollution. Id., at 35. The D. C. Circuit read the Act to\navoid putting States in this position: EPA had an implicit\nstatutory duty, the court held, to give upwind States a\nreasonable opportunity to allocate their emission budgets\namong in-state sources before the Agency’s authority to\nissue FIPs could be triggered. Id., at 37.\n   The D. C. Circuit also held that the Agency’s two-part\ninterpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision ignored\nthree “red lines . . . cabin[ing the] EPA’s authority.” Id., at\n19. First, the D. C. Circuit interpreted the Good Neighbor\nProvision to require upwind States to reduce emissions in\n“a manner proportional to their contributio[n]” to pollution\nin downwind States. Id., at 21. The Transport Rule,\nhowever, treated all regulated upwind States alike, re­\ngardless of their relative contribution to the overall prob­\nlem. See id., at 23. It required all upwind States\n“screened in” at step one to reduce emissions in accord\nwith the uniform cost thresholds set during the step two\ncontrol analysis. Imposing these uniform cost thresholds,\nthe Court of Appeals observed, could force some upwind\nStates to reduce emissions by more than their “fair share.”\nId., at 27.\n   According to the Court of Appeals, EPA had also failed\nto ensure that the Transport Rule did not mandate up­\n12       EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwind States to reduce pollution unnecessarily. The Good\nNeighbor Provision, the D. C. Circuit noted, “targets [only]\nthose emissions from upwind States that ‘contribute sig­\nnificantly to nonattainment’ ” of a NAAQS in downwind\nStates. Id., at 22. Pollution reduction beyond that goal\nwas “unnecessary over-control,” outside the purview of the\nAgency’s statutory mandate. Ibid. Because the emission\nbudgets were calculated by reference to cost alone, the\ncourt concluded that EPA had done nothing to guard\nagainst, or even measure, the “over-control” potentially\nimposed by the Transport Rule. See ibid.\n   Finally, by deciding, at the screening analysis, that\nupwind contributions below the one-percent threshold\nwere insignificant, EPA had established a “floor” on the\nAgency’s authority to act. See id., at 20, and n. 13. Again\npointing to the rule’s reliance on costs, the Court of Ap­\npeals held that EPA had failed to ensure that upwind\nStates were not being forced to reduce emissions below the\none-percent threshold. See ibid.\n   In dissent, Judge Rogers criticized the majority for\ndeciding two questions that were not, in her view, properly\nbefore the court. See id., at 40–46, 51–58. First, she\naddressed the majority’s insistence that FIPs abide a\nState’s opportunity to allocate its emission budget among\nin-state sources. She regarded the respondents’ plea to\nthat effect as an untimely attack on EPA’s previous SIP\ndisapprovals. See id., at 40–46. Second, in Judge Rogers’\nassessment, the respondents had failed to raise their\nsubstantive objections to the Transport Rule with the\nspecificity necessary to preserve them for review. See id.,\nat 51–58. On the merits, Judge Rogers found nothing in\nthe Act to require, or even suggest, that EPA must quan-\ntify a State’s good neighbor obligations before it promul­\ngated a FIP. See id., at 46–51. She also disagreed with\nthe court’s conclusion that the Transport Rule unreasona­\nbly interpreted the Act. See id., at 58–60.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

C.\nCircuit held, the Agency must give upwind States the\nopportunity to propose SIPs allocating those budgets\namong in-state sources before issuing a FIP. 696 F. 3d, at\n37. As the State respondents put it, a FIP allocating a\nState’s emission budget “must issue after EPA has quanti­\nfied the States’ good-neighbor obligations [in an emission\nbudget] and given the States a reasonable opportunity to\nmeet those obligations in SIPs.” Brief for State Respond­\nents 20.\n   Before reaching the merits of this argument, we first\nreject EPA’s threshold objection that the claim is untimely.\nAccording to the Agency, this argument—and the D. C.\nCircuit’s opinion accepting it—rank as improper collateral\nattacks on EPA’s prior SIP disapprovals. As earlier re­\ncounted, see supra, at 9–10, EPA, by the time it issued the\nTransport Rule, had determined that each regulated\nupwind State had failed to submit a SIP adequate to\nsatisfy the Good Neighbor Provision. Many of those de­\nterminations, because unchallenged, became final after 60\ndays, see 42 U. S. C. §7607(b)(1), and did so before the\npetitions here at issue were filed. EPA argues that the\nCourt cannot question exercise of the Agency’s FIP author­\nity without subjecting these final SIP disapprovals to\nuntimely review.\n   We disagree. The gravamen of the State respondents’\nchallenge is not that EPA’s disapproval of any particular\nSIP was erroneous. Rather, respondents urge that, not­\nwithstanding these disapprovals, the Agency was obliged\nto grant an upwind State a second opportunity to promul­\n14         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngate adequate SIPs once EPA set the State’s emission\nbudget. This claim does not depend on the validity of the\nprior SIP disapprovals. Even assuming the legitimacy of\nthose disapprovals, the question remains whether EPA\nwas required to do more than disapprove a SIP, as the\nState respondents urge, to trigger the Agency’s statutory\nauthority to issue a FIP.12\n                             B\n  Turning to the merits, we hold that the text of the stat­\nute supports EPA’s position. As earlier noted, see supra,\nat 4–5, the CAA sets a series of precise deadlines to which\nthe States and EPA must adhere. Once EPA issues any\nnew or revised NAAQS, a State has three years to adopt a\nSIP adequate for compliance with the Act’s requirements.\nSee 42 U. S. C. §7410(a)(1). Among those requirements is\nthe Act’s mandate that SIPs “shall” include provisions\nsufficient to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision.\n§7410(a)(2).\n  If EPA determines a SIP to be inadequate, the Agency’s\nmandate to replace it with a FIP is no less absolute:\n       “[EPA] shall promulgate a [FIP] at any time within\n     2 years after the [Agency]\n       “(A) finds that a State has failed to make a required\n     submission or finds that the plan or plan revision\n     submitted by the State does not satisfy the minimum\n     [relevant] criteria . . . , or\n\n——————\n  12 The State respondents make a second argument we do not reach.\n\nThey urge that EPA could not impose FIPs on several upwind States\nwhose SIPs had been previously approved by the Agency under CAIR.\nEPA changed those approvals to disapprovals when it issued the\nTransport Rule, see 76 Fed. Reg. 48220, and the States assert that the\nprocess by which EPA did so was improper. That argument was not\npassed on by the D. C. Circuit, see 696 F. 3d 7, 31, n. 29 (2012), and we\nleave it for the Court of Appeals to consider in the first instance on\nremand.\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n       “(B) disapproves a [SIP] in whole or in part,\n     “unless the State corrects the deficiency, and [EPA]\n     approves the plan or plan revision, before the [Agency]\n     promulgates such [FIP].” §7410(c)(1).\nIn other words, once EPA has found a SIP inadequate, the\nAgency has a statutory duty to issue a FIP “at any time”\nwithin two years (unless the State first “corrects the defi­\nciency,” which no one contends occurred here).\n   The D. C. Circuit, however, found an unwritten excep­\ntion to this strict time prescription for SIPs aimed at\nimplementing the Good Neighbor Provision. Expecting\nany one State to develop a “comprehensive solution” to the\n“collective problem” of interstate air pollution without first\nreceiving EPA’s guidance was, in the Court of Appeals’\nassessment, “set[ting] the States up to fail.” 696 F. 3d, at\n36–37. The D. C. Circuit therefore required EPA, after\npromulgating each State’s emission budget, to give the\nState a “reasonable” period of time to propose SIPs im­\nplementing its budget. See id., at 37.\n   However sensible (or not) the Court of Appeals’ posi­\ntion,13 a reviewing court’s “task is to apply the text [of the\nstatute], not to improve upon it.” Pavelic & LeFlore v.\nMarvel Entertainment Group, Div. of Cadence Industries\nCorp., 493 U. S. 120, 126 (1989). Nothing in the Act dif­\n——————\n   13 On this point, the dissent argues that it is “beyond responsible\n\ndebate that the States cannot possibly design FIP-proof SIPs without\nknowing the EPA-prescribed targets at which they must aim.” Post, at\n18. Many of the State respondents thought otherwise, however, when\nlitigating the matter in Michigan v. EPA, 213 F. 3d 663 (CADC 2000).\nSee Final Brief for Petitioning States in No. 98–1497 (CADC), p. 34\n(“EPA has the responsibility to establish NAAQS,” but without further\nintervention by EPA, “States [have] the duty and right to develop . . .\nSIPs . . . to meet those NAAQS.”). See also id., at 37 (“EPA’s role is to\ndetermine whether the SIP submitted is ‘adequate’ . . . not to dictate\ncontents of the submittal in the first instance. . . . [E]ach State has the\nright and the obligation to write a SIP that complies with §[74]10(a)(2),\nincluding the ‘good neighbor’ provision.”).\n16       EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nferentiates the Good Neighbor Provision from the several\nother matters a State must address in its SIP. Rather, the\nstatute speaks without reservation: Once a NAAQS has\nbeen issued, a State “shall” propose a SIP within three\nyears, §7410(a)(1), and that SIP “shall” include, among\nother components, provisions adequate to satisfy the Good\nNeighbor Provision, §7410(a)(2).\n   Nor does the Act condition the duty to promulgate a FIP\non EPA’s having first quantified an upwind State’s good\nneighbor obligations. As Judge Rogers observed in her\ndissent from the D. C. Circuit’s decision, the Act does not\nrequire EPA to furnish upwind States with information of\nany kind about their good neighbor obligations before a\nFIP issues. See 696 F. 3d, at 47. Instead, a SIP’s failure\nto satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision, without more,\ntriggers EPA’s obligation to issue a federal plan within\ntwo years. §7410(c). After EPA has disapproved a SIP,\nthe Agency can wait up to two years to issue a FIP, during\nwhich time the State can “correc[t] the deficiency” on its\nown. Ibid. But EPA is not obliged to wait two years or\npostpone its action even a single day: The Act empowers\nthe Agency to promulgate a FIP “at any time” within the\ntwo-year limit. Ibid. Carving out an exception to the Act’s\nprecise deadlines, as the D. C. Circuit did, “rewrites a\ndecades-old statute whose plain text and structure estab­\nlish a clear chronology of federal and State responsibili­\nties.” 696 F. 3d, at 47 (Rogers, J., dissenting).\n   The practical difficulties cited by the Court of Appeals\ndo not justify departure from the Act’s plain text. See\nBarnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 461–462\n(2002) (We “must presume that a legislature says in a\nstatute what it means and means in a statute what it says\nthere.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). When Con­\ngress elected to make EPA’s input a prerequisite to state\naction under the Act, it did so expressly.

A State’s obli­\ngation to adopt a SIP, moreover, arises only after EPA has\nfirst set the NAAQS the State must meet. §7410(a)(1).\nHad Congress intended similarly to defer States’ discharge\nof their obligations under the Good Neighbor Provision,\nCongress, we take it, would have included a similar direc­\ntion in that section. See Jama v. Immigration and Cus-\ntoms Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 341 (2005) (“We do not\nlightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted\ntext requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply,\nand our reluctance is even greater when Congress has\nshown elsewhere in the same statute that it knows how to\nmake such a requirement manifest.”).\n   In short, nothing in the statute places EPA under an\nobligation to provide specific metrics to States before they\nundertake to fulfill their good neighbor obligations. By\naltering the schedule Congress provided for SIPs and\nFIPs, the D. C. Circuit stretched out the process. It al­\nlowed a delay Congress did not order and placed an infor­\nmation submission obligation on EPA Congress did not\nimpose. The D. C. Circuit, we hold, had no warrant thus\nto revise the CAA’s action-ordering prescriptions.\n                              C\n   At oral argument, the State respondents emphasized\nEPA’s previous decisions, in the NOX SIP Call and CAIR,\nto quantify the emission reductions required of upwind\nStates before the window to propose a SIP closed. See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 37–39, 42–43, 45–46. In their view, by failing\nto accord States a similar grace period after issuing States’\nemission budgets, EPA acted arbitrarily. See ibid.\n   Whatever pattern the Agency followed in its NOX SIP\ncall and CAIR proceedings, EPA retained discretion to\nalter its course provided it gave a reasonable explanation\nfor doing so. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States,\n18         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nInc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29,\n42 (1983). The Agency presented such an explanation in\nthe Transport Rule. As noted, see supra, at 6, the D. C.\nCircuit’s North Carolina decision admonished EPA to act\nwith dispatch in amending or replacing CAIR, the\nTransport Rule’s predecessor. See 550 F. 3d, at 1178\n(warning EPA that the stay of the court’s decision to va­\ncate CAIR would not persist “indefinite[ly]”). Given North\nCarolina’s stress on expeditious action to cure the infir-\nmities the court identified in CAIR, EPA thought\nit “[in]appropriate to establish [the] lengthy transition\nperiod” entailed in allowing States time to propose new or\namended SIPs implementing the Transport Rule emission\nbudgets. See 76 Fed. Reg. 48220 (citing North Carolina,\n550 F. 3d 1176). Endeavoring to satisfy the D. C. Circuit’s\ndirective, EPA acted speedily, issuing FIPs contemporane­\nously with the Transport Rule. In light of the firm dead­\nlines imposed by the Act, which we hold the D. C. Circuit\nlacked authority to alter, we cannot condemn EPA’s deci­\nsion as arbitrary or capricious.14\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n  The D. C.

See Brief for Federal Petitioners 34–42.\nThis failure at the administrative level, EPA urges, fore­\ncloses judicial review. Id., at 34.\n  Assuming, without deciding, that respondents did not\nmeet the Act’s “reasonable specificity” requirement during\nthe comment period, we do not regard that lapse as “juris­\ndictional.” This Court has cautioned against “profligate\nuse” of the label “jurisdictional.” Sebelius v. Auburn Re-\ngional Medical Center, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op.,\nat 6). A rule may be “mandatory,” yet not “jurisdictional,”\nwe have explained. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 510 (2006). Section 7607(d)(7)(B), we hold, is of that\ncharacter. It does not speak to a court’s authority, but\nonly to a party’s procedural obligations. See Kontrick v.\nRyan, 540 U. S. 443, 455 (2004). Had EPA pursued the\n“reasonable specificity” argument vigorously before the\nD. C. Circuit, we would be obligated to address the merits\nof the argument. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. ___,\n___ (2012) (slip op., at 10). But EPA did not press the\nargument unequivocally. Before the D. C.

We\ntherefore do not count the prescription an impassable\nhindrance to our adjudication of the respondents’ attack\non EPA’s interpretation of the Transport Rule. We turn to\nthat attack mindful of the importance of the issues re­\nspondents raise to the ongoing implementation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision.\n20       EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n    We routinely accord dispositive effect to an agency’s\nreasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutory lan­\nguage. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), is the pathmarking\ndecision, and it bears a notable resemblance to the cases\nbefore us. Chevron concerned EPA’s definition of the term\n“source,” as used in the 1977 Amendments to the CAA.\nId., at 840, n. 1. Those amendments placed additional\nrestrictions on companies’ liberty to add new pollution\n“sources” to their factories. See id., at 840. Although\n“source” might have been interpreted to refer to an indi­\nvidual smokestack, EPA construed the term to refer to an\nentire plant, thereby “treat[ing] all of the pollution­\nemitting devices within the [plant] as though they were\nencased within a single ‘bubble.’” Ibid. Under the Agency’s\ninterpretation, a new pollution-emitting device would not\nsubject a plant to the additional restrictions if the “altera­\ntion [did] not increase the total emissions [produced by]\nthe plant.” Ibid.\n    This Court held EPA’s interpretation of “source” a rea­\nsonable construction of an ambiguous statutory term.\nWhen “Congress has not directly addressed the precise\n[interpretative] question at issue,” we cautioned, a review­\ning court cannot “simply impose its own construction o[f]\nthe statute.” Id., at 843. Rather, the agency is charged\nwith filling the “gap left open” by the ambiguity. Id., at\n866. Because “ ‘a full understanding of the force of the\nstatutory policy . . . depend[s] upon more than ordinary\nknowledge’ ” of the situation, the administering agency’s\nconstruction is to be accorded “controlling weight unless\n. . . arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the\nstatute.” Id., at 844 (quoting United States v. Shimer, 367\nU. S. 374, 382 (1961)). Determining that none of those\nterms fit EPA’s interpretation of “source,” the Court de­\nferred to the Agency’s judgment.\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 21\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   We conclude that the Good Neighbor Provision delegates\nauthority to EPA at least as certainly as the CAA provi­\nsions involved in Chevron. The statute requires States to\neliminate those “amounts” of pollution that “contribute\nsignificantly to nonattainment” in downwind States. 42\nU. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i) (emphasis added). Thus, EPA’s\ntask15 is to reduce upwind pollution, but only in “amounts”\nthat push a downwind State’s pollution concentrations\nabove the relevant NAAQS. As noted earlier, however, the\nnonattainment of downwind States results from the collec­\ntive and interwoven contributions of multiple upwind\nStates. See supra, at 3. The statute therefore calls\nupon the Agency to address a thorny causation problem:\nHow should EPA allocate among multiple contributing up-\nwind States responsibility for a downwind State’s excess\npollution?\n   A simplified example illustrates the puzzle EPA faced.\nSuppose the Agency sets a NAAQS, with respect to a\nparticular pollutant, at 100 parts per billion (ppb), and\nthat the level of the pollutant in the atmosphere of down­\nwind State A is 130 ppb. Suppose further that EPA has\ndetermined that each of three upwind States—X, Y, and\nZ—contributes the equivalent of 30 ppb of the relevant\npollutant to State A’s airspace. The Good Neighbor Provi­\nsion, as just observed, prohibits only upwind emissions\nthat contribute significantly to downwind nonattainment.\nEPA’s authority under the provision is therefore limited to\neliminating a total of 30 ppb,16 i.e., the overage caused by\n\n——————\n  15 Though we speak here of “EPA’s task,” the Good Neighbor Provi­\n\nsion is initially directed to upwind States. As earlier explained, see\nPart II–B, supra, only after a State has failed to propose a SIP ade­\nquate for compliance with the provision is EPA called upon to act.\n  16 Because of the uncertainties inherent in measuring interstate air\n\npollution, see supra, at 3–4, reductions of exactly 30 ppb likely are\nunattainable. See infra, at 30–31.\n22         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe collective contribution of States X, Y, and Z.17\n   How is EPA to divide responsibility among the three\nStates? Should the Agency allocate reductions propor­\ntionally (10 ppb each), on a per capita basis, on the basis of\nthe cost of abatement, or by some other metric? See Brief\nfor Federal Petitioners 50 (noting EPA’s consideration of\ndifferent approaches). The Good Neighbor Provision does\nnot answer that question for EPA. Cf. Chevron, 467 U. S.,\nat 860 (“[T]he language of [the CAA] simply does not\ncompel any given interpretation of the term ‘source.’ ”).\nUnder Chevron, we read Congress’ silence as a delegation\nof authority to EPA to select from among reasonable op­\ntions. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229\n(2001).18\n   Yet the Court of Appeals believed that the Act speaks\nclearly, requiring EPA to allocate responsibility for reduc­\ning emissions in “a manner proportional to” each State’s\n“contributio[n]” to the problem. 696 F. 3d, at 21. Nothing\n——————\n  17 For  simplicity’s sake, the hypothetical assumes that EPA has not\nrequired any emission reductions by the downwind State itself.\n   18 The statutory gap identified also exists in the Good Neighbor Provi­\n\nsion’s second instruction. That instruction requires EPA to eliminate\namounts of upwind pollution that “interfere with maintenance” of a\nNAAQS by a downwind State. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i). This mandate con­\ntains no qualifier analogous to “significantly,” and yet it entails a\ndelegation of administrative authority of the same character as the one\ndiscussed above. Just as EPA is constrained, under the first part of the\nGood Neighbor Provision, to eliminate only those amounts that “con­\ntribute . . . to nonattainment,” EPA is limited, by the second part of the\nprovision, to reduce only by “amounts” that “interfere with mainte-\nnance,” i.e., by just enough to permit an already-attaining State to\nmaintain satisfactory air quality. (Emphasis added.) With multiple\nupwind States contributing to the maintenance problem, however, EPA\nconfronts the same challenge that the “contribute significantly” man­\ndate creates: How should EPA allocate reductions among multiple\nupwind States, many of which contribute in amounts sufficient to\nimpede downwind maintenance? Nothing in either clause of the Good\nNeighbor Provision provides the criteria by which EPA is meant to\napportion responsibility.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin the text of the Good Neighbor Provision propels EPA\ndown this path. Understandably so, for as EPA notes, the\nD. C. Circuit’s proportionality approach could scarcely be\nsatisfied in practice. See App. in No. 11–1302 etc.\n(CADC), p. 2312 (“[W]hile it is possible to determine an\nemission reduction percentage if there is a single down­\nwind [receptor], most upwind states contribute to multiple\ndownwind [receptors] (in multiple states) and would have\na different reduction percentage for each one.”).\n  To illustrate, consider a variation on the example set out\nabove. Imagine that States X and Y now contribute air\npollution to State A in a ratio of one to five, i.e., State Y\ncontributes five times the amount of pollution to State A\nthan does State X. If State A were the only downwind\nState to which the two upwind States contributed, the\nD. C. Circuit’s proportionality requirement would be easy\nto meet: EPA could require State Y to reduce its emissions\nby five times the amount demanded of State X.\n  The realities of interstate air pollution, however, are not\nso simple. Most upwind States contribute pollution to\nmultiple downwind States in varying amounts. See 76\nFed. Reg. 48239–48246. See also Brief for Respondent\nCalpine Corp. et al. in Support of Petitioners 48–49 (offer­\ning examples). Suppose then that States X and Y also\ncontribute pollutants to a second downwind State (State\nB), this time in a ratio of seven to one. Though State Y\ncontributed a relatively larger share of pollution to State\nA, with respect to State B, State X is the greater offender.\nFollowing the proportionality approach with respect to\nState B would demand that State X reduce its emissions\nby seven times as much as State Y. Recall, however, that\nState Y, as just hypothesized, had to effect five times as\nlarge a reduction with respect to State A. The Court of\nAppeals’ proportionality edict with respect to both State A\nand State B appears to work neither mathematically nor\nin practical application. Proportionality as to one down­\n24         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwind State will not achieve proportionality as to others.\nQuite the opposite. And where, as is generally true, up­\nwind States contribute pollution to more than two down­\nwind receptors, proportionality becomes all the more\nelusive.\n  Neither the D. C. Circuit nor respondents face up to this\nproblem. The dissent, for its part, strains to give meaning\nto the D. C. Circuit’s proportionality constraint as applied\nto a world in which multiple upwind States contribute\nemissions to multiple downwind locations. In the dissent’s\nview, upwind States must eliminate emissions by “what­\never minimum amount reduces” their share of the overage\nin each and every one of the downwind States to which\nthey are linked. See post, at 8. In practical terms, this\nmeans each upwind State will be required to reduce emis­\nsions by the amount necessary to eliminate that State’s\nlargest downwind contribution. The dissent’s formulation,\nhowever, does not account for the combined and cumu-\nlative effect of each upwind State’s reductions on attain­\nment in multiple downwind locations. See ibid. (“Under a\nproportional-reduction approach, State X would be required\nto eliminate emissions of that pollutant by whatever min­\nimum amount reduces both State A’s level by 0.2 unit and\nState B’s by 0.7 unit.” (emphasis added)). The result\nwould be costly overregulation unnecessary to, indeed\nin conflict with, the Good Neighbor Provision’s goal of\nattainment.19\n——————\n  19 To see why, one need only slightly complicate the world envisioned\n\nby the dissent. Assume the world is made up of only four States—two\nupwind (States X and Y), and two downwind (States A and B). Suppose\nalso, as the dissent allows, see post, at 9, that the reductions State X\nmust make to eliminate its share of the amount by which State A is in\nnonattainment are more than necessary for State X to eliminate its\nshare of State B’s nonattainment. As later explained, see infra, at 29–\n30, this kind of “over-control,” we agree with the dissent, is acceptable\nunder the statute. Suppose, however, that State Y also contributes to\npollution in both State A and State B such that the reductions it must\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  25\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   In response, the dissent asserts that EPA will “simply\nbe required to make allowance for” the overregulation\ncaused by its “proportional-reduction” approach. Post, at\n11. What criterion should EPA employ to determine\nwhich States will have to make those “allowance[s]” and\nby how much? The dissent admits there are “multiple\nways” EPA might answer those questions. Ibid. But\nproportionality cannot be one of those ways, for the\nproportional-reduction approach is what led to the over­\nregulation in the first place. And if a nonproportional\napproach can play a role in setting the final allocation of\nreduction obligations, then it is hardly apparent why EPA,\nfree to depart from proportionality at the back end, cannot\ndo so at the outset.\n   Persuaded that the Good Neighbor Provision does not\ndictate the particular allocation of emissions among con­\ntributing States advanced by the D. C. Circuit, we must\nnext decide whether the allocation method chosen by EPA\nis a “permissible construction of the statute.” Chevron,\n467 U. S., at 843. As EPA interprets the statute, upwind\nemissions rank as “amounts [that] . . . contribute signifi­\ncantly to nonattainment” if they (1) constitute one percent\n——————\nmake to eliminate its proportion of State B’s overage exceed the reduc­\ntions it must make to bring State A into attainment. In this case, the\ndissent would have State X reduce by just enough to eliminate its share\nof State A’s nonattainment and more than enough to eliminate its\nshare of State B’s overage. The converse will be true as to State Y:\nUnder the dissent’s approach, State Y would have to reduce by the\n“minimum” necessary to eliminate its proportional share of State B’s\nnonattainment and more than enough to eliminate its proportion of\nState A’s overage. The result is that the total amount by which both\nStates X and Y are required to reduce will exceed what is necessary for\nattainment in all downwind States involved (i.e., in both State A and\nState B). Over-control thus unnecessary to achieving attainment in all\ninvolved States is impermissible under the Good Neighbor Provision.\nSee infra, at 30, n. 23. The problem would worsen were the hypothet­\nical altered to include more than two downwind States and two upwind\nStates, the very real circumstances EPA must address.\n26       EPA v.

P.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nor more of a relevant NAAQS in a nonattaining downwind\nState and (2) can be eliminated under the cost threshold\nset by the Agency. See 76 Fed. Reg. 48254. In other\nwords, to identify which emissions were to be eliminated,\nEPA considered both the magnitude of upwind States’\ncontributions and the cost associated with eliminating\nthem.\n   The Industry respondents argue that, however EPA\nultimately divides responsibility among upwind States,\nthe final calculation cannot rely on costs. The Good\nNeighbor Provision, respondents and the dissent empha­\nsize, “requires each State to prohibit only those ‘amounts’\nof air pollution emitted within the State that ‘contribute\nsignificantly’ to another State’s nonattaintment.” Brief for\nIndustry Respondents 23 (emphasis added). See also post,\nat 6. The cost of preventing emissions, they urge, is\nwholly unrelated to the actual “amoun[t]” of air pollution\nan upwind State contributes. Brief for Industry Respond­\nents 23. Because the Transport Rule considers costs,\nrespondents argue, “States that contribute identical\n‘amounts’ . . . may be deemed [by EPA] to have [made]\nsubstantially different” contributions. Id., at 30.\n   But, as just explained, see supra, at 21–22, the Agency\ncannot avoid the task of choosing which among equal\n“amounts” to eliminate. The Agency has chosen, sensibly\nin our view, to reduce the amount easier, i.e., less costly, to\neradicate, and nothing in the text of the Good Neighbor\nProvision precludes that choice.\n   Using costs in the Transport Rule calculus, we agree\nwith EPA, also makes good sense. Eliminating those\namounts that can cost-effectively be reduced is an efficient\nand equitable solution to the allocation problem the Good\nNeighbor Provision requires the Agency to address. Effi­\ncient because EPA can achieve the levels of attainment,\ni.e., of emission reductions, the proportional approach\naims to achieve, but at a much lower overall cost.

Upwind States that have not yet\nimplemented pollution controls of the same stringency as\ntheir neighbors will be stopped from free riding on their\nneighbors’ efforts to reduce pollution. They will have to\nbring down their emissions by installing devices of the\nkind in which neighboring States have already invested.\n   Suppose, for example, that the industries of upwind\nState A have expended considerable resources installing\nmodern pollution-control devices on their plants. Facto­\nries in upwind State B, by contrast, continue to run old,\ndirty plants. Yet, perhaps because State A is more popu­\nlous and therefore generates a larger sum of pollution\noverall, the two States’ emissions have equal effects on\ndownwind attainment. If State A and State B are re­\nquired to eliminate emissions proportionally (i.e., equally),\nsources in State A will be compelled to spend far more per\nton of reductions because they have already utilized lower\ncost pollution controls. State A’s sources will also have to\nachieve greater reductions than would have been required\nhad they not made the cost-effective reductions in the first\nplace. State A, in other words, will be tolled for having\ndone more to reduce pollution in the past.20 EPA’s cost­\nbased allocation avoids these anomalies.\n   Obligated to require the elimination of only those\n“amounts” of pollutants that contribute to the nonattain­\nment of NAAQS in downwind States, EPA must decide\nhow to differentiate among the otherwise like contribu­\ntions of multiple upwind States. EPA found decisive the\n——————\n  20 The dissent’s approach is similarly infirm. It, too, would toll those\n\nupwind States that have already invested heavily in means to reduce\nthe pollution their industries cause, while lightening the burden on\nStates that have done relatively less to control pollution emanating\nfrom local enterprises.\n28         EPA v.

Once a State was screened in at step one of EPA’s\nanalysis, its emission budget was calculated solely with\nreference to the uniform cost thresholds the Agency selected\nat step two. The Transport Rule thus left open the\npossibility that a State might be compelled to reduce\nemissions beyond the point at which every affected down­\nwind State is in attainment, a phenomenon the Court of\nAppeals termed “over-control.” 696 F. 3d, at 22; see supra,\nat 12.

American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457 (2001). In\nWhitman, we held that the relevant text of the CAA “unambiguously\nbars” EPA from considering costs when determining a NAAQS. Id., at\n471. Section 7409(b)(1) commands EPA to set NAAQS at levels “requi­\nsite to protect the public health” with “an adequate margin of safety.”\nThis mandate, we observed in Whitman, was “absolute,” and precluded\nany other consideration (e.g., cost) in the NAAQS calculation. Id., at\n465 (internal quotation marks omitted). Not so of the Good Neighbor\nProvision, which grants EPA discretion to eliminate “amounts [of\npollution that] . . . contribute significantly to nonattainment” down­\nwind. On the particular “amounts” that should qualify for elimination,\nthe statute is silent. Unlike the provision at issue in Whitman, which\nprovides express criteria by which EPA is to set NAAQS, the Good\nNeighbor Provision, as earlier explained, fails to provide any metric by\nwhich EPA can differentiate among the contributions of multiple\nupwind States. See supra, at 21–22.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

If EPA requires an upwind State to\nreduce emissions by more than the amount necessary to\nachieve attainment in every downwind State to which it is\nlinked, the Agency will have overstepped its authority,\nunder the Good Neighbor Provision, to eliminate those\n“amounts [that] contribute . . . to nonattainment.” Nor\ncan EPA demand reductions that would drive an upwind\nState’s contribution to every downwind State to which it is\nlinked below one percent of the relevant NAAQS. Doing\nso would be counter to step one of the Agency’s interpreta­\ntion of the Good Neighbor Provision. See 76 Fed. Reg.\n48236 (“[S]tates whose contributions are below th[e]\nthresholds do not significantly contribute to nonattain­\nment . . . of the relevant NAAQS.”).\n   Neither possibility, however, justifies wholesale invali­\ndation of the Transport Rule. First, instances of “over­\ncontrol” in particular downwind locations, the D. C. Cir­\ncuit acknowledged, see 696 F. 3d, at 22, may be incidental\nto reductions necessary to ensure attainment elsewhere.\nBecause individual upwind States often “contribute signif­\nicantly” to nonattainment in multiple downwind locations,\nthe emissions reduction required to bring one linked\ndownwind State into attainment may well be large enough\nto push other linked downwind States over the attainment\nline.22 As the Good Neighbor Provision seeks attainment\n——————\n  22 The following example, based on the record, is offered in Brief for\n\nRespondent Calpine Corp. et al. in Support of Petitioners 52–54.

For reasons earlier explained, see supra,\nat 3–4, a degree of imprecision is inevitable in tackling the\nproblem of interstate air pollution. Slight changes in wind\npatterns or energy consumption, for example, may vary\ndownwind air quality in ways EPA might not have antici­\npated. The Good Neighbor Provision requires EPA to seek\n——————\nWest Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Indiana each contribute in varying\namounts to five different nonattainment areas in three downwind\nStates. Id., at 52. Implementation of the Transport Rule, EPA model­\ning demonstrates, will bring three of these five areas into attainment\nby a comfortable margin, and a fourth only barely. See id., at 53, fig. 2.\nThe fifth downwind receptor, however, will still fall short of attainment\ndespite the reductions the rule requires. See ibid. But if EPA were to\nlower the emission reductions required of the upwind States to reduce\nover-attainment in the first three areas, the area barely achieving\nattainment would no longer do so, and the area still in nonattainment\nwould fall even further behind. Thus, “over-control” of the first three\ndownwind receptors is essential to the attainment achieved by the\nfourth and to the fifth’s progress toward that goal.\n   23 The dissent suggests that our qualification of the term “over­\n\ncontrol” is tantamount to an admission that “nothing stands in the way\nof [a] proportional-reduction approach.” Post, at 9. Not so. Permitting\n“over-control” as to one State for the purpose of achieving attainment in\nanother furthers the stated goal of the Good Neighbor Provision, i.e.,\nattainment of NAAQS. By contrast, a proportional-reduction scheme is\nneither necessary to achieve downwind attainment, nor mandated by\nthe terms of the statute, as earlier discussed, see supra, at 21–25.\nPermitting “over-control” for the purpose of achieving proportionality\nwould thus contravene the clear limits the statute places on EPA’s good\nneighbor authority, i.e., to eliminate only those “amounts” of upwind\npollutants essential to achieving attainment downwind.\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           31\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndownwind attainment of NAAQS notwithstanding the\nuncertainties. Hence, some amount of over-control, i.e.,\nemission budgets that turn out to be more demanding\nthan necessary, would not be surprising. Required to\nbalance the possibilities of under-control and over-control,\nEPA must have leeway in fulfilling its statutory mandate.\n   Finally, in a voluminous record, involving thousands of\nupwind-to-downwind linkages, respondents point to only a\nfew instances of “unnecessary” emission reductions, and\neven those are contested by EPA. Compare Brief for\nIndustry Respondents 19 with Reply Brief for Federal\nPetitioners 21–22. EPA, for its part, offers data, contested\nby respondents, purporting to show that few (if any) up­\nwind States have been required to limit emissions below\nthe one-percent threshold of significance. Compare Brief\nfor Federal Petitioners 37, 54–55, with Brief for Industry\nRespondents 40.\n   If any upwind State concludes it has been forced to\nregulate emissions below the one-percent threshold or\nbeyond the point necessary to bring all downwind States\ninto attainment, that State may bring a particularized, as­\napplied challenge to the Transport Rule, along with any\nother as-applied challenges it may have. Cf. Babbitt v.\nSweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515\nU. S. 687, 699–700 (1995) (approving agency’s reasonable\ninterpretation of statute despite possibility of improper\napplications); American Hospital Assn. v. NLRB, 499 U.

With the statute\ninvolved in the present cases, however, Congress did it\nright. It specified quite precisely the responsibility of an\nupwind State under the Good Neighbor Provision: to\neliminate those amounts of pollutants that it contributes\nto downwind problem areas. But the Environmental\nProtection Agency was unsatisfied with this system.\nAgency personnel, perhaps correctly, thought it more\nefficient to require reductions not in proportion to the\namounts of pollutants for which each upwind State is\nresponsible, but on the basis of how cost-effectively each\ncan decrease emissions.\n2          EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  Today, the majority approves that undemocratic revi­\nsion of the Clean Air Act. The Agency came forward with\na textual justification for its action, relying on a farfetched\nmeaning of the word “significantly” in the statutory text.\nThat justification is so feeble that today’s majority does\nnot even recite it, much less defend it. The majority\nreaches its result (“Look Ma, no hands!”) without benefit\nof text, claiming to have identified a remarkable “gap” in\nthe statute, which it proceeds to fill (contrary to the plain\nlogic of the statute) with cost-benefit analysis—and then,\nwith no pretended textual justification at all, simply ex­\ntends cost-benefit analysis beyond the scope of the alleged\ngap.\n  Additionally, the majority relieves EPA of any obligation\nto announce novel interpretations of the Good Neighbor\nProvision before the States must submit plans that are\nrequired to comply with those interpretations. By accord­\ning the States primacy in deciding how to attain the gov­\nerning air-quality standards, the Clean Air Act is preg­\nnant with an obligation for the Agency to set those\nstandards before the States can be expected to achieve\nthem. The majority nonetheless approves EPA’s promul­\ngation of federal plans implementing good-neighbor\nbenchmarks before the States could conceivably have met\nthose benchmarks on their own.\n  I would affirm the judgment of the D.

Yet today the major-\nity treats the text of the Clean Air Act not as the source\nand ceiling of EPA’s authority to regulate interstate air\npollution, but rather as a difficulty to be overcome in\npursuit of the Agency’s responsibility to “craf[t] a solution\nto the problem of interstate air pollution.” Ante, at 3. In\nreality, Congress itself has crafted the solution. The Good\nNeighbor Provision requires each State to eliminate what­\never “amounts” of “air pollutant[s]” “contribute significantly\nto nonattainment” or “interfere with maintenance” of\nnational ambient air-quality standards (NAAQS) in other\nStates. 42 U. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The statute ad­\ndresses solely the environmental consequences of emis­\nsions, not the facility of reducing them; and it requires\nStates to shoulder burdens in proportion to the size of\ntheir contributions, not in proportion to the ease of bearing\nthem. EPA’s utterly fanciful “from each according to its\nability” construction sacrifices democratically adopted text\nto bureaucratically favored policy. It deserves no defer­\nence under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).\n         A. Alleged Textual Support: “Significantly”\n   In the Government’s argument here, the asserted tex­\ntual support for the efficient-reduction approach adopted by\nEPA in the Transport Rule is the ambiguity of the word\n“significantly” in the statutory requirement that each\nState eliminate those “amounts” of pollutants that “con­\ntribute significantly to nonattainment” in downwind\nStates. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) (emphasis added). As de­\nscribed in the Government’s briefing:\n    “[T]he term ‘significantly’ . . . is ambiguous, and . . .\n    EPA may permissibly determine the amount of a\n    State’s ‘significant’ contribution by reference to the\n    amount of emissions reductions achievable through\n    application of highly cost-effective controls.” Reply\n4        EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n    Brief for Federal Petitioners 15–16 (emphasis added;\n    some internal quotation marks omitted).\nAnd as the Government stated at oral argument:\n    “[I]n terms of the language, ‘contribute significantly,’\n    . . . EPA reasonably construed that term to include a\n    component of difficulty of achievement [i.e., cost]; that\n    is, in common parlance, we might say that dunking a\n    basketball is a more significant achievement for\n    somebody who is 5 feet 10 than for somebody who is 6\n    feet 10.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 9 (emphasis added).\n   But of course the statute does not focus on whether the\nupwind State has “achieved significantly”; it asks whether\nthe State has “contributed significantly” to downwind\npollution. The provision addresses the physical effects of\nphysical causes, and it is only the magnitude of the rela­\ntionship sufficient to trigger regulation that admits of\nsome vagueness. Stated differently, the statute is ambig­\nuous as to how much of a contribution to downwind pollu­\ntion is “significant,” but it is not at all ambiguous as to\nwhether factors unrelated to the amounts of pollutants\nthat make up a contribution affect the analysis. Just as\n“[i]t does not matter whether the word ‘yellow’ is ambigu­\nous when the agency has interpreted it to mean ‘purple,’ ”\nUnited States v. Home Concrete & Supply, LLC, 566 U. S.\n___, ___, n. 1 (2012) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2, n. 1), it does not\nmatter whether the phrase “amounts which . . . contribute\nsignificantly [to downwind NAAQS nonattainment]” is\nambiguous when EPA has interpreted it to mean\n“amounts which are inexpensive to eliminate.”\n   It would be extraordinary for Congress, by use of the\nsingle word “significantly,” to transmogrify a statute that\nassigns responsibility on the basis of amounts of pollut­\nants emitted into a statute authorizing EPA to reduce\ninterstate pollution in the manner that it believes most\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nefficient. We have repeatedly said that Congress “does not\nalter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in\nvague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not, one\nmight say, hide elephants in mouseholes.” Whitman v.\nAmerican Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001)\n(citing MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Tele-\nphone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 231 (1994); FDA v.\nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 159–\n160 (2000)).\n   The statute’s history demonstrates that “significantly” is\nnot code for “feel free to consider compliance costs.” The\nprevious version of the Good Neighbor Provision required\neach State to prohibit emissions that would “prevent at­\ntainment or maintenance by any other State of any\n[NAAQS].” 91 Stat. 693 (emphasis added). It is evident\nthat the current reformulation (targeting “any air pollut-\nant in amounts which will . . . contribute significantly to\nnonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any\nother State with respect to any [NAAQS]”) was meant\nsimply to eliminate any implication that the polluting\nState had to be a but-for rather than merely a contributing\ncause of the downwind nonattainment or maintenance\nproblem—not to allow cost concerns to creep in through\nthe back door.\n   In another respect also EPA’s reliance upon the word\n“significantly” is plainly mistaken. The Good Neighbor\nProvision targets for elimination not only those emissions\nthat “contribute significantly to nonattainment [of\nNAAQS] in . . . any other State,” but also those that “inter­\nfere with maintenance [of NAAQS] by . . . any other\nState.” §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The wiggle-word “significantly”\nis absent from the latter phrase.         EPA does not—\ncannot—provide any textual justification for the conclu­\nsion that, when the same amounts of a pollutant travel\ndownwind from States X and Y to a single area in State A,\nthe emissions from X but not Y can be said to “interfere\n6        EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwith maintenance” of the NAAQS in A just because they\nare cheaper to eliminate. Yet EPA proposes to use the\n“from each according to its ability” approach for nonat­\ntainment areas and maintenance areas.\n   To its credit, the majority does not allude to, much less\ntry to defend, the Government’s “significantly” argument.\nBut there is a serious downside to this. The sky-hook of\n“significantly” was called into service to counter the crite­\nrion of upwind-state responsibility plainly provided in the\nstatute’s text: amounts of pollutants contributed to down­\nwind problem areas. See Brief for Federal Petitioners 42–\n45. Having forsworn reliance on “significantly” to convert\nresponsibility for amounts of pollutants into responsibility\nfor easy reduction of pollutants, the majority is impaled\nupon the statutory text.\n                    B. The Alleged “Gap”\n   To fill the void created by its abandonment of EPA’s\n“significantly” argument, the majority identifies a sup­\nposed gap in the text, which EPA must fill: While the text\nsays that each upwind State must be responsible for its\nown contribution to downwind pollution, it does not say\nhow responsibility is to be divided among multiple States\nwhen the total of their combined contribution to downwind\npollution in a particular area exceeds the reduction that\nthe relevant NAAQS requires. In the example given by\nthe majority, ante, at 21–22, when each of three upwind\nStates contributes 30 units of a pollutant to a downwind\nState but the reduction required for that State to comply\nwith the NAAQS is only 30 units, how will responsibility\nfor that 30 units be apportioned? Wow, that’s a hard\none—almost the equivalent of asking who is buried in\nGrant’s Tomb. If the criterion of responsibility is amounts\nof pollutants, then surely shared responsibility must be\nbased upon relative amounts of pollutants—in the major­\nity’s example, 10 units for each State. The statute makes\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nno sense otherwise. The Good Neighbor Provision con­\ntains a gap only for those who blind themselves to the\nobvious in order to pursue a preferred policy.\n   But not only does the majority bring in cost-benefit\nanalysis to fill a gap that does not really exist. Having\nfilled that “gap,” it then extends the efficiency-based prin­\nciple to situations beyond the imaginary gap—that is,\nsituations where no apportionment is required. Even\nwhere an upwind State contributes pollutants to only a\nsingle downwind State, its annual emissions “budget” will\nbe based not upon the amounts of pollutants it contrib­\nutes, but upon what “pollution controls [are] available at\nthe chosen cost thresholds.” Ante, at 9. EPA’s justification\nwas its implausible (and only half-applicable) notion that\n“significantly” imports cost concerns into the provision.\nThe majority, having abandoned that absurdity, is left to\ndeal with the no-apportionment situation with no de­\nfense—not even an imaginary gap—against a crystal-clear\nstatutory text.\n   C. The Majority’s Criticisms of Proportional Reduction\n                      1. Impossibility\n   The majority contends that a proportional-reduction\napproach “could scarcely be satisfied in practice” and\n“appears to work neither mathematically nor in practical\napplication, ante, at 23—in essence, that the approach is\nimpossible of application. If that were true, I know of no\nlegal authority and no democratic principle that would\nderive from it the consequence that EPA could rewrite the\nstatute, rather than the consequence that the statute\nwould be inoperative. “There are sometimes statutes\nwhich no rule or canon of interpretation can make effec­\ntive or applicable to the situations of fact which they\npurport to govern. In such cases the statute must simply\nfail.” 3 R. Pound, Jurisprudence 493 (1959) (footnote\nomitted). In other words, the impossibility argument has\n8         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nno independent force: It is relevant only if the majority’s\ntextual interpretation is permissible. But in any event,\nthe argument is wrong.\n  The impossibility theorem rests upon the following\nscenario: “Imagine that States X and Y . . . contribute air\npollution to State A in a ratio of one to five . . . .” Ante, at\n23. And suppose that “States X and Y also contribute\npollutants to a second downwind State (State B), this time\nin a ratio of seven to one.” Ibid. The majority concludes\nthat “[t]he Court of Appeals’ proportionality edict with\nrespect to both State A and State B appears to work nei­\nther mathematically nor in practical application.” Ibid.\nBut why not? The majority’s model relies on two faulty\npremises—one an oversimplification and the other a mis­\napprehension.\n  First, the majority’s formulation suggests that EPA\nmeasures the comparative downwind drift of pollutants in\nfree-floating proportions between States. In reality, how­\never, EPA assesses quantities (in physical units), not\nproportions. So, the majority’s illustration of a 1-to-5 ratio\ndescribing the relative contributions of States X and Y to\nState A’s pollution might mean (for example) that X is\nresponsible for 0.2 unit of some pollutant above the\nNAAQS in A and that Y is responsible for 1 unit. And\nthe second example, assuming a 7-to-1 ratio underlying\nState X’s and Y’s contributions to State B’s pollution,\nmight mean that State X supplies 0.7 unit of the same pol­\nlutant above the NAAQS and State Y, 0.1 unit. Under a\nproportional-reduction approach, State X would be re­\nquired to eliminate emissions of that pollutant by what-\never minimum amount reduces both State A’s level by 0.2\nunit and State B’s by 0.7 unit. State Y, in turn, would be\nrequired to curtail its emissions by whatever minimum\namount decreases both State A’s measure by 1 unit and\nState B’s by 0.1 unit.\n  But, the majority objects, the reductions that State X\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmust make to help bring State B into compliance may be\nmore than those necessary for it to help bring State A into\ncompliance, resulting in “over-control” of X with respect to\nA. See ante, at 23–25, and n. 19. This objection discloses\nthe second flaw in the impossibility theorem. Echoing\nEPA, see Brief for Federal Petitioners 47–48, the majority\nbelieves that the D. C. Circuit’s interpretation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision forbids over-control with respect to\neven a single downwind receptor. That is the only way in\nwhich the proportional-reduction approach could be\ndeemed “to work neither mathematically nor in practical\napplication” on its face. Ante, at 23. But the premise is\nincorrect. Although some of the D. C. Circuit’s simplified\nexamples might support that conclusion, its opinion explic­\nitly acknowledged that the complexity of real-world condi­\ntions demands the contrary: “To be sure, . . . there may be\nsome truly unavoidable over-control in some downwind\nStates that occurs as a byproduct of the necessity of reduc­\ning upwind States’ emissions enough to meet the NAAQS\nin other downwind States.” 696 F. 3d 7, 22 (2012). More­\nover, the majority itself recognizes that the Good Neighbor\nProvision does not categorically prohibit over-control. “As\nthe Good Neighbor Provision seeks attainment in every\ndownwind State, . . . exceeding attainment in one State\ncannot rank as ‘over-control’ unless unnecessary to achiev­\ning attainment in any downwind State.” Ante, at 29–30.\nThe majority apparently fails to appreciate that, having\ncleared up that potential point of confusion, nothing\nstands in the way of the proportional-reduction approach.\n   The majority relies on an EPA document preceding the\nTransport Rule to establish the Agency’s supposed belief\nthat the proportional-reduction approach “could scarcely\nbe satisfied in practice.” Ante, at 23. But the document\nsays no such thing. Rather, it shows that the Agency\nrejected a proportion-based, “air[-]quality-only” methodol­\nogy not because it was impossible of application, but be­\n10       EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncause it failed to account for costs. See App. in No. 11–\n1302 etc. (CADC), pp. 2311–2312. The document labels as\na “technical difficulty” (not an impossibility) the fact that\n“most upwind states contribute to multiple downwind\n[receptors] (in multiple states) and would have a different\nreduction percentage for each one.” Id., at 2312. The\nClean Air Act is full of technical difficulties, and this one\nis overcome by requiring each State to make the greatest\nreduction necessary with respect to any downwind area.\n                       2. Over-Control\n   Apparently conceding that the proportional-reduction\napproach may not be impossible of application after all,\nthe majority alternatively asserts that it would cause\n“costly overregulation unnecessary to, indeed in conflict\nwith, the Good Neighbor Provision’s goal of attainment.”\nAnte, at 24. This assertion of massive overregulation\nassumes that a vast number of downwind States will be\nthe accidental beneficiaries of collateral pollution reduc­\ntions—that is, nontargeted reductions that occur as a\nconsequence of required reductions targeted at neighbor­\ning downwind States. (Collateral pollution reduction is\nthe opposite of collateral damage, so to speak.) The major­\nity contends that the collateral pollution reductions en­\njoyed by a downwind State will cause the required upwind\nreductions actually targeting that State to exceed the level\nnecessary to assure attainment or maintenance, thus\nproducing unnecessary over-control. I have no reason to\nbelieve that the problem of over-control is as extensive and\nthus “costly” as the majority alleges, and the majority\nprovides none.\n   But never mind that. It suffices to say that over-control\nis no more likely to occur when the required reductions are\napportioned among upwind States on the basis of amounts\nof pollutants contributed than when they are apportioned\non the basis of cost. There is no conceivable reason why\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 11\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe efficient-reduction States that bear the brunt of the\nmajority’s (and EPA’s) approach are less likely to be over­\ncontrolled than the major-pollution-causing States that\nwould bear the brunt of my (and the statute’s) approach.\nIndeed, EPA never attempted to establish that the\nTransport Rule did not produce gross over-control. See\n696 F. 3d, at 27. What causes the problem of over-control\nis not the manner of apportioning the required reductions,\nbut the composite volume of the required reductions in\neach downwind State. If the majority’s approach reduces\nover-control (it admittedly does not entirely eliminate it),\nthat is only because EPA applies its cost-effectiveness\nprinciple not just to determining the proportions of re­\nquired reductions that each upwind State must bear, but\nto determining the volume of those required reductions.\nSee supra, at 7.\n   In any case, the solution to over-control under a propor­\ntional-reduction system is not difficult to discern. In\ncalculating good-neighbor responsibilities, EPA would\nsimply be required to make allowance for what I have\ncalled collateral pollution reductions. The Agency would\nset upwind States’ obligations at levels that, after taking\ninto account those reductions, suffice to produce attain­\nment in all downwind States. Doubtless, there are multi­\nple ways for the Agency to accomplish that task in accord­\nance with the statute’s amounts-based, proportional\nfocus.2 The majority itself invokes an unexplained device\nto prevent over-control “in uncommon particular applica­\ntions” of its scheme. Ante, at 31. Whatever that device is,\nit can serve just as well to prevent over-control under the\napproach I have outlined.\n——————\n  2 The majority insists that “proportionality cannot be one of those\n\nways.” Ante, at 25. But it is easy to imagine precluding unnecessary\nover-control by reducing in a percent-based manner the burdens of each\nupwind State linked to a given downwind area, which would retain the\nproportionality produced by my approach.\n12       EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   I fully acknowledge that the proportional-reduction\napproach will demand some complicated computations\nwhere one upwind State is linked to multiple downwind\nStates and vice versa. I am confident, however, that\nEPA’s skilled number-crunchers can adhere to the stat­\nute’s quantitative (rather than efficiency) mandate by\ncrafting quantitative solutions. Indeed, those calculations\ncan be performed at the desk, whereas the “from each\naccording to its ability” approach requires the unwieldy\nfield examination of many pollution-producing sources\nwith many sorts of equipment.\n                      D. Plus Ça Change: \n\n     EPA’s Continuing Quest for Cost-Benefit Authority \n\n   The majority agrees with EPA’s assessment that\n“[u]sing costs in the Transport Rule calculus . . . makes\ngood sense.” Ante, at 26. Its opinion declares that\n“[e]liminating those amounts that can cost-effectively be\nreduced is an efficient and equitable solution to the alloca­\ntion problem the Good Neighbor Provision requires the\nAgency to address.” Ibid. Efficient, probably. Equitable?\nPerhaps so, but perhaps not. See Brief for Industry Re­\nspondents 35–36. But the point is that whether efficiency\nshould have a dominant or subordinate role is not for EPA\nor this Court to determine.\n   This is not the first time EPA has sought to convert the\nClean Air Act into a mandate for cost-effective regulation.\nWhitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457\n(2001), confronted EPA’s contention that it could consider\ncosts in setting NAAQS. The provision at issue there, like\nthis one, did not expressly bar cost-based decisionmak­\ning—and unlike this one, it even contained words that\nwere arguably ambiguous in the relevant respect. Specifi­\ncally, §7409(b)(1) instructed EPA to set primary NAAQS\n“the attainment and maintenance of which . . . are requi­\nsite to protect the public health” with “an adequate margin\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

As the respondents in American Trucking\nargued, setting NAAQS without considering costs may\nbring about failing industries and fewer jobs, which in\nturn may produce poorer and less healthy citizens. See\nid., at 466. But we concluded that “in the context of ” the\nentire provision, that interpretation “ma[de] no sense.”\nIbid. As quoted earlier, we said that Congress “does not\nalter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in\nvague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not . . . hide\nelephants in mouseholes.” Id., at 468.\n   In American Trucking, the Court “refused to find im­\nplicit in ambiguous sections of the [Clear Air Act] an\nauthorization to consider costs that has elsewhere, and so\noften, been expressly granted,” id., at 467, citing a tradition\ndating back to Union Elec. Co. v. EPA, 427 U. S. 246, 257,\nand n. 5 (1976). There are, indeed, numerous Clean Air\nAct provisions explicitly permitting costs to be taken into\naccount. See, e.g., §7404(a)(1); §7521(a)(2); §7545(c)(2);\n§7547(a)(3); §7554(b)(2); §7571(b); §7651c(f)(1)(A). Ameri-\ncan Trucking thus demanded “a textual commitment of\nauthority to the EPA to consider costs,” 531 U. S., at 468—\na hurdle that the Good Neighbor Provision comes nowhere\nclose to clearing. Today’s opinion turns its back upon that\ncase and is incompatible with that opinion.3\n——————\n  3 The   majority shrugs off American Trucking in a footnote, reasoning\nthat because it characterized the provision there in question as “abso­\nlute,” it has nothing to say about the Good Neighbor Provision, which is\nnot absolute. See ante, at 28, n. 21. This is a textbook example of\nbegging the question: Since the Good Neighbor Provision is not absolute\n(the very point at issue here), American Trucking, which dealt with a\nprovision that is absolute, is irrelevant. To the contrary, American\nTrucking is right on point. As described in text, the provision at issue\n14         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n      II. Imposition of Federal Implementation Plans\n   The D. C. Circuit vacated the Transport Rule for the\nadditional reason that EPA took the reins in allocating\nemissions budgets among pollution-producing sources\nthrough Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) without\nfirst providing the States a meaningful opportunity to\nperform that task through State Implementation Plans\n(SIPs). The majority rejects that ruling on the ground\nthat “the Act does not require EPA to furnish upwind\nStates with information of any kind about their good\nneighbor obligations before a FIP issues.” Ante, at 16.\n“[N]othing in the statute,” the majority says, “places EPA\nunder an obligation to provide specific metrics to States\nbefore they undertake to fulfill their good neighbor obliga­\ntions.” Ante, at 17. This remarkably expansive reasoning\nmakes a hash of the Clean Air Act, transforming it from a\nprogram based on cooperative federalism to one of central­\nized federal control. Nothing in the Good Neighbor Provi­\nsion suggests such a stark departure from the Act’s fun­\ndamental structure.\n        A. Implications of State Regulatory Primacy\n   Down to its very core, the Clean Air Act sets forth a\nfederalism-focused regulatory strategy. The Act begins by\ndeclaring that “air pollution prevention (that is, the reduc­\ntion or elimination, through any measures, of the amount\nof pollutants produced or created at the source) and air\npollution control at its source is the primary responsibility\nof States and local governments.” §7401(a)(3) (emphasis\nadded). State primacy permeates Title I, which addresses\nthe promulgation and implementation of NAAQS, in par­\nticular. Under §7409(a), EPA must promulgate NAAQS\nfor each pollutant for which air-quality criteria have been\n—————— \n\nhere is even more categorical (“absolute”) than the provision at issue in\n\nAmerican Trucking. \n\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nissued pursuant to §7408. Section 7410(a)(1), in turn,\nrequires each State, usually within three years of each\nnew or revised NAAQS, to submit a SIP providing for its\n“implementation, maintenance, and enforcement.” EPA\nmay step in to take over that responsibility if, and only if,\na State discharges it inadequately. Specifically, if the\nAgency finds that a State has failed to make a required or\ncomplete submission or disapproves a SIP, it “shall prom­\nulgate a [FIP] at any time within 2 years . . . , unless the\nState corrects the deficiency, and [EPA] approves the [SIP]\nor [SIP] revision.” §7410(c)(1).\n   To describe the effect of this statutory scheme in simple\nterms: After EPA sets numerical air-quality benchmarks,\n“Congress plainly left with the States . . . the power to\ndetermine which sources would be burdened by regulation\nand to what extent.” Union Elec. Co., 427 U. S., at 269.\nThe States are to present their chosen means of achieving\nEPA’s benchmarks in SIPs, and only if a SIP fails to meet\nthose goals may the Agency commandeer a State’s author­\nity by promulgating a FIP. “[S]o long as the ultimate\neffect of a State’s choice of emission limitations is compli­\nance with the [NAAQS], the State is at liberty to adopt\nwhatever mix of emission limitations it deems best suited\nto its particular situation.” Train v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 421 U. S. 60, 79 (1975). EPA, we\nhave emphasized, “is relegated by the Act to a secondary\nrole in the process of determining and enforcing the spe-\ncific, source-by-source emission limitations which are\nnecessary if the [NAAQS] are to be met.” Ibid.\n   The Good Neighbor Provision is one of the requirements\nwith which SIPs must comply. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The\nstatutory structure described above plainly demands that\nEPA afford States a meaningful opportunity to allocate\nreduction responsibilities among the sources within their\nborders. But the majority holds that EPA may in effect\nforce the States to guess at what those responsibilities\n16        EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmight be by requiring them to submit SIPs before learning\nwhat the Agency regards as a “significan[t]” contribu­\ntion—with the consequence of losing their regulatory\nprimacy if they guess wrong. EPA asserts that the D. C.\nCircuit “was wrong as a factual matter” in reasoning that\nStates cannot feasibly implement the Good Neighbor\nProvision without knowing what the Agency considers\ntheir obligations to be. Brief for Federal Petitioners 29.\nThat is literally unbelievable. The only support that EPA\ncan muster are the assertions that “States routinely un­\ndertake technically complex air quality determinations”\nand that “emissions information from all States is publicly\navailable.” Ibid. As respondents rightly state: “All the\nscientific knowledge in the world is useless if the States\nare left to guess the way in which EPA might ultimately\nquantify ‘significan[ce].’ ” Brief for State Respondents 50.\n   Call it “punish[ing] the States for failing to meet a\nstandard that EPA had not yet announced and [they] did\nnot yet know,” 696 F. 3d, at 28; asking them “to hit the\ntarget . . . before EPA defines [it],” id., at 32; requiring\nthem “to take [a] stab in the dark,” id., at 35; or “set[ting]\nthe States up to fail,” id., at 37.

Past EPA Practice\n   EPA itself has long acknowledged the proposition that it\nis nonsensical to expect States to comply with the Good\nNeighbor Provision absent direction about what consti­\ntutes a “significan[t]” contribution to interstate pollution.\n   The Agency consistently adopted that position prior to\nthe Transport Rule. In 1998, when it issued the NOX SIP\nCall under §7410(k)(5), EPA acknowledged that “[w]ithout\ndetermining an acceptable level of NOX reductions, the\nupwind State would not have guidance as to what is an\nacceptable submission.” 63 Fed. Reg. 57370. EPA deemed\nit “most efficient—indeed necessary—for the Federal\ngovernment to establish the overall emissions levels for\nthe various States.” Ibid. Accordingly, the Agency quanti­\nfied good-neighbor responsibilities and then allowed\nStates a year to submit SIPs to implement them. Id., at\n57450–57451.\n   Similarly, when EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate\nRule (CAIR) in 2005 under §7410(c), it explicitly “recog­\nnize[d] that States would face great difficulties in develop­\ning transport SIPs to meet the requirements of today’s\naction without th[e] data and policies” provided by the\nRule, including “judgments from EPA concerning the\nappropriate criteria for determining whether upwind\nsources contribute significantly to downwind nonattain­\nment under [§74]10(a)(2)(D).” 70 id., at 25268–25269.\nThe Agency thus gave the States 18 months to submit\nSIPs implementing their new good-neighbor responsibili­\nties. See id., at 25166–25167, 25176. Although EPA\npublished FIPs before that window closed, it specified that\nthey were meant to serve only as a “Federal backstop” and\nwould not become effective unless necessary “a year after\nthe CAIR SIP submission deadline.” 71 id., at 25330–\n25331 (2006).\n18          EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                           SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   Even since promulgating the Transport Rule, EPA has\nrepeatedly reaffirmed that States cannot be expected to\nread the Agency’s mind. In other proceedings, EPA has\ntime and again stated that although “[s]ome of the ele­\nments of the [SIP-submission process] are relatively\nstraightforward, . . . others clearly require interpretation\nby EPA through rulemaking, or recommendations through\nguidance, in order to give specific meaning for a particular\nNAAQS.” 76 id., at 58751 (2011). As an example of the\nlatter, the Agency has remarked that the Good Neighbor\nProvision “contains numerous terms that require substan­\ntial rulemaking by EPA in order to determine such basic\npoints as what constitutes significant contribution,” citing\nCAIR. Ibid., n. 6. In fact, EPA repeated those precise\nstatements not once, not twice, but 30 times following\npromulgation of the Transport Rule.4\n   Notwithstanding what parties may have argued in other\nlitigation many years ago, it is beyond responsible debate\nthat the States cannot possibly design FIP-proof SIPs\nwithout knowing the EPA-prescribed targets at which\nthey must aim. EPA insists that it enjoys significant\ndiscretion—indeed, that it can consider essentially what­\never factors it wishes—to determine what constitutes a\n“significan[t]” contribution to interstate pollution; and it\nsimultaneously asserts that the States ought to know\nwhat quantities it will choose.

Abuse of Discretion\n   The majority attempts to place the blame for hollowing\nout the core of the Clean Air Act on “the Act’s plain text.”\nAnte, at 16. The first textual element to which it refers is\n§7410(c)’s requirement that after EPA has disapproved a\nSIP, it “shall promulgate a [FIP] at any time within 2\nyears.” That is to say, the Agency has discretion whether\nto act at once or to defer action until some later point\nduring the 2-year period. But it also has discretion to\nwork within the prescribed timetable to respect the right­\nful role of States in the statutory scheme by delaying the\nissuance or enforcement of FIPs pending the resubmission\nand approval of SIPs—as EPA’s conduct surrounding\nCAIR clearly demonstrates. And all of this assumes that\nthe Agency insists on disapproving SIPs before promulgat­\ning the applicable good-neighbor standards—though in\nfact EPA has discretion to publicize those metrics before\nthe window to submit SIPs closes in the first place.\n   The majority states that the Agency “retained discretion\nto alter its course” from the one pursued in the NOX SIP\nCall and CAIR, ante, at 17, but that misses the point.\nThe point is that EPA has discretion to arrange things so\nas to preserve the Clean Air Act’s core principle of state\nprimacy—and that it is an abuse of discretion to refuse to\ndo so. See §7607(d)(9)(A); see also 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A)\n(identical text in the Administrative Procedure Act).\nIndeed, the proviso in §7410(c)(1) that the Agency’s au­\nthority to promulgate a FIP within the 2-year period\nterminates if “the State corrects the deficiency, and [EPA]\napproves the [SIP] or [SIP] revision” explicitly contem­\nplates just such an arrangement.5\n——————\n   5 I am unimpressed, by the way, with the explanation that the major-\n\nity accepts for EPA’s about-face: that the D. C. Circuit admonished it to\n“act with dispatch in amending or replacing CAIR.” Ante, at 18 (citing\n20         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   The majority’s conception of administrative discretion is\nso sprawling that it would allow EPA to subvert state\nprimacy not only with respect to the interstate-pollution\nconcerns of the Good Neighbor Provision, but with respect\nto the much broader concerns of the NAAQS program\nmore generally. States must submit SIPs “within 3 years”\nof each new or revised NAAQS “or such shorter period as\n[EPA] may prescribe.” §7410(a)(1) (emphasis added).\nBecause there is no principled reason to read that schedul­\ning provision in a less malleable manner than the one at\nissue here, under the majority’s view EPA could demand\nthat States submit SIPs within a matter of days—or even\nhours—after a NAAQS publication or else face the imme­\ndiate imposition of FIPs.\n   The second element of “plain text” on which the majority\nrelies is small beer indeed. The Good Neighbor Provision\ndoes not expressly state that EPA must publish target\nquantities before the States are required to submit SIPs—\neven though the Clean Air Act does so for NAAQS more\ngenerally and for vehicle inspection and maintenance\nprograms, see §7511a(c)(3)(B). From that premise, the\nmajority reasons that “[h]ad Congress intended similarly\nto defer States’ discharge of their obligations under the\nGood Neighbor Provision, Congress . . . would have included\na similar direction in that section.” Ante, at 17. Per­\nhaps so. But EPA itself read the statute differently when\nit declared in the NOX SIP Call that “[d]etermining the\noverall level of air pollutants allowed to be emitted in a\nState is comparable to determining [NAAQS], which the\ncourts have recognized as EPA’s responsibility, and is\n——————\nNorth Carolina v.

But because that interpretive canon, like\nothers, is just one clue to aid construction, it can be over­\ncome by more powerful indications of meaning elsewhere\nin the statute.

The negative-implication canon is\neasily overcome by the statute’s state-respecting struc­\nture—not to mention the sheer impossibility of submitting\na sensible SIP without EPA guidance.

Argued December 10, 2013—Decided April 29, 2014*\nCongress and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency)\n  have, over the course of several decades, made many efforts to deal\n  with the complex challenge of curtailing air pollution emitted in up-\n  wind States, but causing harm in other, downwind States. As rele-\n  vant here, the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) directs EPA to establish\n  national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for pollutants at\n  levels that will protect public health. 42 U. S. C. §§7408, 7409. Once\n  EPA settles on a NAAQS, the Agency must designate “nonattain-\n  ment” areas, i.e., locations where the concentration of a regulated pol-\n  lutant exceeds the NAAQS. §7407(d). Each State must submit a\n  State Implementation Plan, or SIP, to EPA within three years of any\n  new or revised NAAQS. §7410(a)(1). From the date EPA determines\n  that a State SIP is inadequate, the Agency has two years to promul-\n  gate a Federal Implementation Plan, or FIP. §7410(c)(1). Among\n  other components, the CAA mandates SIP compliance with the Good\n  Neighbor Provision, which requires SIPs to “contain adequate provi-\n  sions . . . prohibiting . . . any source or other type of emissions activity\n  within the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which\n  will . . . contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with\n  maintenance by, any other State with respect to any . . . [NAAQS].”\n  §7410(a)(2)(D)(i).\n     Several times over the past two decades, EPA has attempted to\n  delineate the Good Neighbor Provision’s scope by identifying when\n——————\n  * Together with No. 12–1183, American Lung Association et al. v.\nEME Homer City Generation, L.

Circuit found fault with the Agency’s 2005 attempt, the\n    Clean Air Interstate Rule, or CAIR, which regulated both nitrogen\n    oxide (NOX) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, the gasses at issue\n    here. The D. C. Circuit nevertheless left CAIR temporarily in place,\n    while encouraging EPA to act with dispatch in dealing with problems\n    the court had identified.\n       EPA’s response to that decision is the Cross-State Air Pollution\n    Rule (Transport Rule), which curbs NOX and SO2 emissions in 27 up-\n    wind States to achieve downwind attainment of three NAAQS. Un-\n    der the Transport Rule, an upwind State “contribute[d] significantly”\n    to downwind nonattainment to the extent its exported pollution both\n    (1) produced one percent or more of a NAAQS in at least one down-\n    wind State and (2) could be eliminated cost-effectively, as determined\n    by EPA. Upwind States are obliged to eliminate only emissions\n    meeting both of these criteria. Through complex modeling, EPA cre-\n    ated an annual emissions “budget” for each regulated State upwind,\n    representing the total quantity of pollution an upwind State could\n    produce in a given year under the Transport Rule. Having earlier de-\n    termined each regulated State’s SIP to be inadequate, EPA, contem-\n    poraneous with the Transport Rule, promulgated FIPs allocating\n    each State’s emissions budgets among its in-state pollution sources.\n       A group of state and local governments (State respondents), joined\n    by industry and labor groups (Industry respondents), petitioned for\n    review of the Transport Rule in the D. C. Circuit. The court vacated\n    the rule in its entirety, holding that EPA’s actions exceeded the\n    Agency’s statutory authority in two respects. Acknowledging that\n    EPA’s FIP authority is generally triggered when the Agency disap-\n    proves a SIP, the court was nevertheless concerned that States would\n    be incapable of fulfilling the Good Neighbor Provision without prior\n    EPA guidance. The court thus concluded that EPA must give States\n    a reasonable opportunity to allocate their emission budgets before is-\n    suing FIPs. The court also found the Agency’s two-part interpreta-\n    tion of the Good Neighbor Provision unreasonable, concluding that\n    EPA must disregard costs and consider exclusively each upwind\n    State’s physically proportionate responsibility for air quality prob-\n    lems downwind.\nHeld:\n    1. The CAA does not command that States be given a second oppor-\n tunity to file a SIP after EPA has quantified the State’s interstate\n pollution obligations. Pp. 13–18.\n       (a) The State respondents do not challenge EPA’s disapproval of\n any particular SIP. Instead, they argue that, notwithstanding these\n disapprovals, the Agency was still obliged to grant upwind States an\n                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nadditional opportunity to promulgate adequate SIPs after EPA had\nset the State’s emission budget. This claim does not turn on the va-\nlidity of the prior SIP disapprovals, but on whether the CAA requires\nEPA do more than disapprove a SIP to trigger the Agency’s authority\nto issue a FIP. Pp. 13–14.\n      (b) The CAA’s plain text supports the Agency: Disapproval of a\nSIP, without more, triggers EPA’s obligation to issue a FIP. The\nstatute sets precise deadlines for the States and EPA. Once EPA is-\nsues any new or revised NAAQS, a State “shall” propose a SIP within\nthree years, 42 U. S. C. §7410(a)(1), and that SIP “shall” include, in-\nter alia, provisions adequate to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision,\n§7410(a)(2). If the EPA finds a SIP inadequate, the Agency has a\nstatutory duty to issue a FIP “at any time” within two years.\n§7410(c)(1). However sensible the D. C. Circuit’s exception to this\nstrict time prescription may be, a reviewing court’s “task is to apply\nthe text [of the statute], not to improve upon it.” Pavelic & LeFlore v.\nMarvel Entertainment Group, Div. of Cadence Industries Corp., 493\nU. S. 120, 126. Nothing in the Act differentiates the Good Neighbor\nProvision from the several other matters a State must address in its\nSIP. Nor does the Act condition the duty to promulgate a FIP on\nEPA’s having first quantified an upwind State’s good neighbor obliga-\ntions. By altering Congress’ SIP and FIP schedule, the D. C. Circuit\nallowed a delay Congress did not order and placed an information\nsubmission obligation on EPA Congress did not impose. Pp. 14–17.\n      (c) The fact that EPA had previously accorded upwind States a\nchance to allocate emission budgets among their in-state sources does\nnot show that the Agency acted arbitrarily by refraining to do so\nhere. EPA retained discretion to alter its course provided it gave a\nreasonable explanation for doing so. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of\nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S.\n29, 42. Here, the Agency had been admonished by the D. C. Circuit\nto act with dispatch in amending or replacing CAIR. Endeavoring to\nsatisfy that directive, EPA acted speedily, issuing FIPs and the\nTransport Rule contemporaneously. Pp. 17–18.\n   2. EPA’s cost-effective allocation of emission reductions among up-\nwind States is a permissible, workable, and equitable interpretation\nof the Good Neighbor Provision. Pp. 18–31.\n      (a) Respondents’ attack on EPA’s interpretation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision is not foreclosed by §7607(d)(7)(B), which pro-\nvides that “[o]nly an objection to a rule . . . raised with reasonable\nspecificity during the period for public comment . . . may be raised\nduring judicial review.” Even assuming that respondents failed to\nobject to the Transport Rule with “reasonable specificity,” that lapse\nis not jurisdictional. Section 7607(d)(7)(B) is a “mandatory,” but not\n4            EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    “jurisdictional,” rule, see Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 510,\n    which speaks to a party’s procedural obligations, not a court’s author-\n    ity, see Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455. Because EPA did not\n    press this argument unequivocally before the D. C. Circuit, it does\n    not pose an impassable hindrance to this Court’s review. Pp. 18–19.\n         (b) This Court routinely accords dispositive effect to an agency’s\n    reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutory language. The\n    Good Neighbor Provision delegates authority to EPA at least as cer-\n    tainly as the CAA provisions involved in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\n    Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. EPA’s au-\n    thority to reduce upwind pollution extends only to those “amounts” of\n    pollution that “contribute significantly to nonattainment” in down-\n    wind States. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i). Because a downwind State’s excess\n    pollution is often caused by multiple upwind States, however, EPA\n    must address how to allocate responsibility among multiple contribu-\n    tors. The Good Neighbor Provision does not dictate a method of ap-\n    portionment. Nothing in the provision, for example, directs the pro-\n    portional allocation method advanced by the D. C. Circuit, a method\n    that works neither mathematically nor in practical application. Un-\n    der Chevron, Congress’ silence effectively delegates authority to EPA\n    to select from among reasonable options. See United States v. Mead\n    Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229.\n       EPA’s chosen allocation method is a “permissible construction of\n    the statute.” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843. The Agency, tasked with\n    choosing which among equal “amounts” to eliminate, has chosen sen-\n    sibly to reduce the amount easier, i.e., less costly, to eradicate. The\n    Industry respondents argue that the final calculation cannot rely on\n    costs, but nothing in the Good Neighbor Provision’s text precludes\n    that choice. And using costs in the Transport Rule calculus is an effi-\n    cient and equitable solution to the allocation problem the Good\n    Neighbor Provision compels the Agency to address. Efficient because\n    EPA can achieve the same levels of attainment, i.e., of emission re-\n    ductions, the proportional approach aims to achieve, but at a much\n    lower overall cost. Equitable because, by imposing uniform cost\n    thresholds on regulated States, EPA’s rule subjects to stricter regula-\n    tion those States that have done less in the past to control their pol-\n    lution. Pp. 20–28.\n         (c) Wholesale invalidation of the Transport Rule is not justified\n    by either of the D. C. Circuit’s remaining objections: that the\n    Transport Rule leaves open the possibility that a State might be\n    compelled to reduce emissions beyond the point at which every af-\n    fected downwind State is in attainment, so-called “over-control”; and\n    that EPA’s use of costs does not foreclose the possibility that an up-\n    wind State would be required to reduce its emissions by so much that\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     5\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  the State would be placed below the one-percent mark EPA set as the\n  initial threshold of “significan[ce].” First, instances of “over-control”\n  in particular downwind locations may be incidental to reductions\n  necessary to ensure attainment elsewhere. As the Good Neighbor\n  Provision seeks attainment in every downwind State, however, ex-\n  ceeding attainment in one State cannot rank as “over-control” unless\n  unnecessary to achieving attainment in any downwind State. Sec-\n  ond, the EPA must have leeway in fulfilling its statutory mandate to\n  balance the possibilities of over-control and “under-control,” i.e., to\n  maximize achievement of attainment downwind. Finally, in a volu-\n  minous record, involving thousands of upwind-to-downwind linkages,\n  respondents point to only a few instances of “unnecessary” emission\n  reductions, and even those are contested by EPA.

Left unregulated,\nthe emitting or upwind State reaps the benefits of the\neconomic activity causing the pollution without bearing all\nthe costs. See Revesz, Federalism and Interstate Envi­\nronmental Externalities, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2341, 2343\n(1996). Conversely, downwind States to which the pollu­\ntion travels are unable to achieve clean air because of the\ninflux of out-of-state pollution they lack authority to con­\ntrol. See S. Rep. No. 101–228, p. 49 (1989). To tackle the\n2        EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproblem, Congress included a Good Neighbor Provision in\nthe Clean Air Act (Act or CAA). That provision, in its\ncurrent phrasing, instructs States to prohibit in-state\nsources “from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which\nwill . . . contribute significantly” to downwind States’\n“nonattainment . . . , or interfere with maintenance,” of\nany EPA-promulgated national air quality standard. 42\nU. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i).\n   Interpreting the Good Neighbor Provision, EPA adopted\nthe Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (commonly and herein­\nafter called the Transport Rule). The rule calls for consid­\neration of costs, among other factors, when determining\nthe emission reductions an upwind State must make to\nimprove air quality in polluted downwind areas. The\nCourt of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit vacated the rule in\nits entirety. It held, 2 to 1, that the Good Neighbor Provi­\nsion requires EPA to consider only each upwind State’s\nphysically proportionate responsibility for each downwind\nState’s air quality problem. That reading is demanded,\naccording to the D. C. Circuit, so that no State will be\nrequired to decrease its emissions by more than its ratable\nshare of downwind-state pollution.\n   In Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), we reversed a D. C.\nCircuit decision that failed to accord deference to EPA’s\nreasonable interpretation of an ambiguous Clean Air Act\nprovision. Satisfied that the Good Neighbor Provision\ndoes not command the Court of Appeals’ cost-blind con­\nstruction, and that EPA reasonably interpreted the provi­\nsion, we reverse the D. C. Circuit’s judgment.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  Air pollution is transient, heedless of state boundaries.\nPollutants generated by upwind sources are often trans­\nported by air currents, sometimes over hundreds of miles,\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nto downwind States. As the pollution travels out of state,\nupwind States are relieved of the associated costs. Those\ncosts are borne instead by the downwind States, whose\nability to achieve and maintain satisfactory air quality is\nhampered by the steady stream of infiltrating pollution.\n   For several reasons, curtailing interstate air pollution\nposes a complex challenge for environmental regulators.\nFirst, identifying the upwind origin of downwind air pollu­\ntion is no easy endeavor. Most upwind States propel\npollutants to more than one downwind State, many\ndownwind States receive pollution from multiple upwind\nStates, and some States qualify as both upwind and\ndownwind. See Brief for Federal Petitioners 6. The over­\nlapping and interwoven linkages between upwind and\ndownwind States with which EPA had to contend number\nin the thousands.1\n   Further complicating the problem, pollutants do not\nemerge from the smokestacks of an upwind State and\nuniformly migrate downwind. Some pollutants stay with­\nin upwind States’ borders, the wind carries others to\ndownwind States, and some subset of that group drifts to\nStates without air quality problems. “The wind bloweth\nwhere it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but\ncanst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.”\nThe Holy Bible, John 3:8 (King James Version). In craft­\ning a solution to the problem of interstate air pollution,\nregulators must account for the vagaries of the wind.\n   Finally, upwind pollutants that find their way down­\nwind are not left unaltered by the journey. Rather, as the\ngases emitted by upwind polluters are carried downwind,\nthey are transformed, through various chemical processes,\ninto altogether different pollutants. The offending gases\n——————\n  1 For the rule challenged here, EPA evaluated 2,479 separate link­\n\nages between downwind and upwind States. Brief for Federal Petition­\ners 6.\n4        EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat issue in these cases—nitrogen oxide (NOX) and sulfur\ndioxide (SO2)—often develop into ozone and fine particu­\nlate matter (PM2.5) by the time they reach the atmos­\npheres of downwind States. See 76 Fed. Reg. 48222–\n48223 (2011). See also 69 Fed. Reg. 4575–4576 (2004)\n(describing the components of ozone and PM2.5). Down­\nwind air quality must therefore be measured for ozone and\nPM2.5 concentrations. EPA’s chore is to quantify the\namount of upwind gases (NOX and SO2) that must be\nreduced to enable downwind States to keep their levels of\nozone and PM2.5 in check.\n                               B\n   Over the past 50 years, Congress has addressed inter­\nstate air pollution several times and with increasing rigor.\nIn 1963, Congress directed federal authorities to “encour­\nage cooperative activities by the States and local govern­\nments for the prevention and control of air pollution.” 77\nStat. 393, 42 U. S. C. §1857a (1964 ed.). In 1970, Congress\nmade this instruction more concrete, introducing features\nstill key to the Act. For the first time, Congress directed\nEPA to establish national ambient air quality standards\n(NAAQS) for pollutants at levels that will protect public\nhealth. See 84 Stat. 1679–1680, as amended, 42 U. S. C.\n§§7408, 7409 (2006 ed.). Once EPA settles on a NAAQS,\nthe Act requires the Agency to designate “nonattainment”\nareas, i.e., locations where the concentration of a regulated\npollutant exceeds the NAAQS. §7407(d).\n   The Act then shifts the burden to States to propose\nplans adequate for compliance with the NAAQS. Each\nState must submit a State Implementation Plan, or SIP,\nto EPA within three years of any new or revised NAAQS.\n§7410(a)(1). If EPA determines that a State has failed to\nsubmit an adequate SIP, either in whole or in part, the Act\nrequires the Agency to promulgate a Federal Implementa­\ntion Plan, or FIP, within two years of EPA’s determina­\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntion, “unless the State corrects the deficiency” before a FIP\nis issued. §7410(c)(1).2\n   The Act lists the matters a SIP must cover. Among SIP\ncomponents, the 1970 version of the Act required SIPs to\ninclude “adequate provisions for intergovernmental coop­\neration” concerning interstate air pollution. §110(a)(2)(E),\n84 Stat. 1681, 42 U. S. C. §1857c–5(a)(2)(E). This statutory\nrequirement, with its text altered over time, has come\nto be called the Good Neighbor Provision.\n   In 1977, Congress amended the Good Neighbor Provi­\nsion to require more than “cooperation.” It directed States\nto submit SIPs that included provisions “adequate” to\n“prohibi[t] any stationary source within the State from\nemitting any air pollutant in amounts which will . . .\nprevent attainment or maintenance [of air quality stand­\nards] by any other State.” §108(a)(4), 91 Stat. 693, 42\nU. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(E) (1976 ed., Supp. II). The amended\nprovision thus explicitly instructed upwind States to\nreduce emissions to account for pollution exported beyond\ntheir borders. As then written, however, the provision\nregulated only individual sources that, considered alone,\nemitted enough pollution to cause nonattainment in a\ndownwind State. Because it is often “impossible to say\nthat any single source or group of sources is the one which\nactually prevents attainment” downwind, S. Rep. No. 101–\n228, p. 21 (1989), the 1977 version of the Good Neighbor\nProvision proved ineffective, see ibid. (noting the provi­\nsion’s inability to curb the collective “emissions [of] multi­\nple sources”).\n   Congress most recently amended the Good Neighbor\nProvision in 1990. The statute, in its current form, re­\nquires SIPs to “contain adequate provisions . . . prohibiting\n——————\n  2 FIPs and SIPs were introduced in the 1970 version of the Act; the\n\nparticular deadlines discussed here were added in 1990. See 104 Stat.\n2409, 2422–2423, 42 U. S. C. §§7401(a)(1), 7410(c) (2006 ed.).\n6        EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n. . . any source or other type of emissions activity within\nthe State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts\nwhich will . . . contribute significantly to nonattainment\nin, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State with\nrespect to any . . . [NAAQS].” 42 U. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)\n(2006 ed.). The controversy before us centers on EPA’s\nmost recent attempt to construe this provision.\n                             C\n   Three times over the past two decades, EPA has at­\ntempted to delineate the Good Neighbor Provision’s scope\nby identifying when upwind States “contribute significantly”\nto nonattainment downwind. In 1998, EPA issued a\nrule known as the “NOX SIP Call.” That regulation lim­\nited NOX emissions in 23 upwind States to the extent such\nemissions contributed to nonattainment of ozone stand­\nards in downwind States. See 63 Fed. Reg. 57356, 57358.\nIn Michigan v. EPA, 213 F. 3d 663 (2000), the D. C. Cir­\ncuit upheld the NOX SIP Call, specifically affirming EPA’s\nuse of costs to determine when an upwind State’s contri­\nbution was “significan[t]” within the meaning of the stat­\nute. Id., at 674–679.\n   In 2005, EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule, or\nCAIR. 70 Fed. Reg. 25162. CAIR regulated both NOX and\nSO2 emissions, insofar as such emissions contributed to\ndownwind nonattainment of two NAAQS, both set in 1997,\none concerning the permissible annual measure of PM2.5,\nand another capping the average ozone level gauged over\nan 8-hour period. See id., at 25171. The D. C. Circuit\ninitially vacated CAIR as arbitrary and capricious. See\nNorth Carolina v. EPA, 531 F. 3d 896, 921 (2008) (per\ncuriam). On rehearing, the court decided to leave the rule\nin place, while encouraging EPA to act with dispatch in\ndealing with problems the court had identified. See North\nCarolina v. EPA, 550 F. 3d 1176, 1178 (2008) (per curiam).\n   The rule challenged here—the Transport Rule—is EPA’s\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nresponse to the D. C. Circuit’s North Carolina decision.\nFinalized in August 2011, the Transport Rule curtails NOX\nand SO2 emissions of 27 upwind States to achieve down­\nwind attainment of three different NAAQS: the two 1997\nNAAQS previously addressed by CAIR, and the 2006\nNAAQS for PM2.5 levels measured on a daily basis. See 76\nFed. Reg. 48208–48209.\n   Under the Transport Rule, EPA employed a “two-step\napproach” to determine when upwind States “contribute[d]\nsignificantly to nonattainment,” id., at 48254, and there­\nfore in “amounts” that had to be eliminated. At step one,\ncalled the “screening” analysis, the Agency excluded as de\nminimis any upwind State that contributed less than one\npercent of the three NAAQS3 to any downwind State\n“receptor,” a location at which EPA measures air quality.\nSee id., at 48236–48237.4 If all of an upwind State’s con­\ntributions fell below the one-percent threshold, that State\nwould be considered not to have “contribute[d] signifi-\ncantly” to the nonattainment of any downwind State. Id.,\nat 48236. States in that category were screened out and\nexempted from regulation under the rule.\n   The remaining States were subjected to a second in­\nquiry, which EPA called the “control” analysis. At this\nstage, the Agency sought to generate a cost-effective allo­\ncation of emission reductions among those upwind States\n“screened in” at step one.\n   The control analysis proceeded this way. EPA first\ncalculated, for each upwind State, the quantity of emis­\nsions the State could eliminate at each of several cost\n——————\n  3 With respect to each NAAQS addressed by the rule, the one-percent\n\nthreshold corresponded to levels of 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter\n(µg/m3) for annual PM2.5, 0.35 µg/m3 for daily PM2.5, and 0.8 parts per\nbillion (ppb) for 8-hour ozone. See 76 Fed. Reg. 48236–48237.\n  4 If, for example, the NAAQS for ozone were 100 ppb, a contribution of\n\nless than 1 ppb to any downwind location would fall outside EPA’s\ncriteria for significance.\n8          EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthresholds. See id., at 48248–48249. Cost for these pur­\nposes is measured as cost per ton of emissions prevented,\nfor instance, by installing scrubbers on powerplant smoke­\nstacks.5 EPA estimated, for example, the amount each\nupwind State’s NOX emissions would fall if all pollution\nsources within each State employed every control measure\navailable at a cost of $500 per ton or less. See id., at\n48249–48251. The Agency then repeated that analysis at\nascending cost thresholds. See ibid.6\n  Armed with this information, EPA conducted complex\nmodeling to establish the combined effect the upwind\nreductions projected at each cost threshold would have on\nair quality in downwind States. See id., at 48249. The\nAgency then identified “significant cost threshold[s],”\npoints in its model where a “noticeable change occurred in\ndownwind air quality, such as . . . where large upwind\nemission reductions become available because a certain\ntype of emissions control strategy becomes cost-effective.”\nIbid. For example, reductions of NOX sufficient to resolve\nor significantly curb downwind air quality problems could\nbe achieved, EPA determined, at a cost threshold of $500\nper ton (applied uniformly to all regulated upwind States).\n“Moving beyond the $500 cost threshold,” EPA concluded,\n“would result in only minimal additional . . . reductions [in\nemissions].” Id., at 48256.7\n  Finally, EPA translated the cost thresholds it had se­\n——————\n    5 Toillustrate, a technology priced at $5,000 and capable of eliminat­\ning two tons of pollution would be stated to “cost” $2,500 per ton.\n   6 For SO2, EPA modeled reductions that would be achieved at cost\n\nlevels of $500, $1,600, $2,300, $2,800, $3,300, and $10,000 per ton\neliminated. See id., at 48251–48253.\n   7 For SO2, EPA determined that, for one group of upwind States, all\n\ndownwind air quality problems would be resolved at the $500 per ton\nthreshold. See id., at 48257. For another group of States, however,\nthis level of controls would not suffice. For those States, EPA found\nthat pollution controls costing $2,300 per ton were necessary.

For each regulated upwind State,\nEPA created an annual emissions “budget.” These budg­\nets represented the quantity of pollution an upwind State\nwould produce in a given year if its in-state sources im­\nplemented all pollution controls available at the chosen\ncost thresholds. See id., at 48249.8 If EPA’s projected\nimprovements to downwind air quality were to be realized,\nan upwind State’s emissions could not exceed the level this\nbudget allocated to it, subject to certain adjustments not\nrelevant here.\n   Taken together, the screening and control inquiries\ndefined EPA’s understanding of which upwind emissions\nwere within the Good Neighbor Provision’s ambit. In\nshort, under the Transport Rule, an upwind State “con­\ntribute[d] significantly” to downwind nonattainment to the\nextent its exported pollution both (1) produced one percent\nor more of a NAAQS in at least one downwind State (step\none) and (2) could be eliminated cost-effectively, as deter­\nmined by EPA (step two). See id., at 48254. Upwind\nStates would be obliged to eliminate all and only emis­\nsions meeting both of these criteria.9\n   For each State regulated by the Transport Rule, EPA\ncontemporaneously promulgated a FIP allocating that\nState’s emission budget among its in-state sources. See\nid., at 48271, 48284–48287.10 For each of these States,\n——————\n  8 In  2014, for example, pollution sources within Texas would be per­\nmitted to emit no more than 243,954 tons of SO2, subject to variations\nspecified by EPA. See id., at 48269 (Table VI.F–1).\n   9 Similarly, upwind States EPA independently determined to be “in­\n\nterfer[ing] with [the] maintenance” of NAAQS downwind were required\nto eliminate pollution only to the extent their emissions satisfied both\nof these criteria. See id., at 48254.\n   10 These FIPs specified the maximum amount of pollution each in­\n\nstate pollution source could emit. Sources below this ceiling could sell\nunused “allocations” to sources that could not reduce emissions to the\nnecessary level as cheaply. See id., at 48271–48272.

P.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nEPA had determined that the State had failed to submit\na SIP adequate for compliance with the Good Neighbor\nProvision. These determinations regarding SIPs became\nfinal after 60 days, see 42 U. S. C. §7607(b)(1)(2006 ed.,\nSupp. V ), and many went unchallenged.11 EPA views the\nSIP determinations as having triggered its statutory\nobligation to promulgate a FIP within two years, see\n§7410(c), a view contested by respondents, see Part II,\ninfra.\n                              D\n  A group of state and local governments (State respond­\nents), joined by industry and labor groups (Industry re­\nspondents), petitioned for review of the Transport Rule in\nthe U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit. Over the\ndissent of Judge Rogers, the Court of Appeals vacated the\nrule in its entirety. See 696 F. 3d 7, 37 (2012).\n  EPA’s actions, the appeals court held, exceeded the\nAgency’s statutory authority in two respects. By promul­\ngating FIPs before giving States a meaningful opportunity\nto adopt their own implementation plans, EPA had, in the\ncourt’s view, upset the CAA’s division of responsibility\nbetween the States and the Federal Government. In the\nmain, the Court of Appeals acknowledged, EPA’s FIP\nauthority is triggered at the moment the Agency disap­\nproves a SIP. See id., at 30. Thus, when a State proposes\n——————\nand-trade” system cuts costs while still reducing pollution to target\nlevels.\n  11 Three States did challenge EPA’s determinations. See Petition for\n\nReview in Ohio v. EPA, No. 11–3988 (CA6); Petition for Review in\nKansas v. EPA, No. 12–1019 (CADC); Notice in Georgia v. EPA, No. 11–\n1427 (CADC). Those challenges were not consolidated with this pro­\nceeding, and they remain pending (held in abeyance for these cases) in\nthe Sixth and D. C. Circuits. See Twelfth Joint Status Report in Ohio\nv. EPA, No. 11–3988 (CA6); Order in Kansas v. EPA, No. 11–1333\n(CADC, May 10, 2013); Order in Georgia v.

See\nid., at 32.\n   But the Court of Appeals ruled that a different regime\napplies to a State’s failure to meet its obligations under\nthe Good Neighbor Provision. While a NAAQS was a\n“clear numerical target,” a State’s good neighbor obligation\nremained “nebulous and unknown,” the court observed,\nuntil EPA calculated the State’s emission budget. Ibid.\nWithout these budgets, the Court of Appeals said, upwind\nStates would be compelled to take a “stab in the dark” at\ncalculating their own significant contribution to interstate\nair pollution. Id., at 35. The D. C. Circuit read the Act to\navoid putting States in this position: EPA had an implicit\nstatutory duty, the court held, to give upwind States a\nreasonable opportunity to allocate their emission budgets\namong in-state sources before the Agency’s authority to\nissue FIPs could be triggered. Id., at 37.\n   The D. C. Circuit also held that the Agency’s two-part\ninterpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision ignored\nthree “red lines . . . cabin[ing the] EPA’s authority.” Id., at\n19. First, the D. C. Circuit interpreted the Good Neighbor\nProvision to require upwind States to reduce emissions in\n“a manner proportional to their contributio[n]” to pollution\nin downwind States. Id., at 21. The Transport Rule,\nhowever, treated all regulated upwind States alike, re­\ngardless of their relative contribution to the overall prob­\nlem. See id., at 23. It required all upwind States\n“screened in” at step one to reduce emissions in accord\nwith the uniform cost thresholds set during the step two\ncontrol analysis. Imposing these uniform cost thresholds,\nthe Court of Appeals observed, could force some upwind\nStates to reduce emissions by more than their “fair share.”\nId., at 27.\n   According to the Court of Appeals, EPA had also failed\nto ensure that the Transport Rule did not mandate up­\n12       EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwind States to reduce pollution unnecessarily. The Good\nNeighbor Provision, the D. C. Circuit noted, “targets [only]\nthose emissions from upwind States that ‘contribute sig­\nnificantly to nonattainment’ ” of a NAAQS in downwind\nStates. Id., at 22. Pollution reduction beyond that goal\nwas “unnecessary over-control,” outside the purview of the\nAgency’s statutory mandate. Ibid. Because the emission\nbudgets were calculated by reference to cost alone, the\ncourt concluded that EPA had done nothing to guard\nagainst, or even measure, the “over-control” potentially\nimposed by the Transport Rule. See ibid.\n   Finally, by deciding, at the screening analysis, that\nupwind contributions below the one-percent threshold\nwere insignificant, EPA had established a “floor” on the\nAgency’s authority to act. See id., at 20, and n. 13. Again\npointing to the rule’s reliance on costs, the Court of Ap­\npeals held that EPA had failed to ensure that upwind\nStates were not being forced to reduce emissions below the\none-percent threshold. See ibid.\n   In dissent, Judge Rogers criticized the majority for\ndeciding two questions that were not, in her view, properly\nbefore the court. See id., at 40–46, 51–58. First, she\naddressed the majority’s insistence that FIPs abide a\nState’s opportunity to allocate its emission budget among\nin-state sources. She regarded the respondents’ plea to\nthat effect as an untimely attack on EPA’s previous SIP\ndisapprovals. See id., at 40–46. Second, in Judge Rogers’\nassessment, the respondents had failed to raise their\nsubstantive objections to the Transport Rule with the\nspecificity necessary to preserve them for review. See id.,\nat 51–58. On the merits, Judge Rogers found nothing in\nthe Act to require, or even suggest, that EPA must quan-\ntify a State’s good neighbor obligations before it promul­\ngated a FIP. See id., at 46–51. She also disagreed with\nthe court’s conclusion that the Transport Rule unreasona­\nbly interpreted the Act. See id., at 58–60.\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Cir­\ncuit had accurately construed the limits the CAA places on\nEPA’s authority. See 570 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                             II\n\n                              A\n\n   Once EPA has calculated emission budgets, the D. C.\nCircuit held, the Agency must give upwind States the\nopportunity to propose SIPs allocating those budgets\namong in-state sources before issuing a FIP. 696 F. 3d, at\n37. As the State respondents put it, a FIP allocating a\nState’s emission budget “must issue after EPA has quanti­\nfied the States’ good-neighbor obligations [in an emission\nbudget] and given the States a reasonable opportunity to\nmeet those obligations in SIPs.” Brief for State Respond­\nents 20.\n   Before reaching the merits of this argument, we first\nreject EPA’s threshold objection that the claim is untimely.\nAccording to the Agency, this argument—and the D. C.\nCircuit’s opinion accepting it—rank as improper collateral\nattacks on EPA’s prior SIP disapprovals. As earlier re­\ncounted, see supra, at 9–10, EPA, by the time it issued the\nTransport Rule, had determined that each regulated\nupwind State had failed to submit a SIP adequate to\nsatisfy the Good Neighbor Provision. Many of those de­\nterminations, because unchallenged, became final after 60\ndays, see 42 U. S. C. §7607(b)(1), and did so before the\npetitions here at issue were filed. EPA argues that the\nCourt cannot question exercise of the Agency’s FIP author­\nity without subjecting these final SIP disapprovals to\nuntimely review.\n   We disagree. The gravamen of the State respondents’\nchallenge is not that EPA’s disapproval of any particular\nSIP was erroneous. Rather, respondents urge that, not­\nwithstanding these disapprovals, the Agency was obliged\nto grant an upwind State a second opportunity to promul­\n14         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngate adequate SIPs once EPA set the State’s emission\nbudget. This claim does not depend on the validity of the\nprior SIP disapprovals. Even assuming the legitimacy of\nthose disapprovals, the question remains whether EPA\nwas required to do more than disapprove a SIP, as the\nState respondents urge, to trigger the Agency’s statutory\nauthority to issue a FIP.12\n                             B\n  Turning to the merits, we hold that the text of the stat­\nute supports EPA’s position. As earlier noted, see supra,\nat 4–5, the CAA sets a series of precise deadlines to which\nthe States and EPA must adhere. Once EPA issues any\nnew or revised NAAQS, a State has three years to adopt a\nSIP adequate for compliance with the Act’s requirements.\nSee 42 U. S. C. §7410(a)(1). Among those requirements is\nthe Act’s mandate that SIPs “shall” include provisions\nsufficient to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision.\n§7410(a)(2).\n  If EPA determines a SIP to be inadequate, the Agency’s\nmandate to replace it with a FIP is no less absolute:\n       “[EPA] shall promulgate a [FIP] at any time within\n     2 years after the [Agency]\n       “(A) finds that a State has failed to make a required\n     submission or finds that the plan or plan revision\n     submitted by the State does not satisfy the minimum\n     [relevant] criteria . . . , or\n\n——————\n  12 The State respondents make a second argument we do not reach.\n\nThey urge that EPA could not impose FIPs on several upwind States\nwhose SIPs had been previously approved by the Agency under CAIR.\nEPA changed those approvals to disapprovals when it issued the\nTransport Rule, see 76 Fed. Reg. 48220, and the States assert that the\nprocess by which EPA did so was improper. That argument was not\npassed on by the D. C. Circuit, see 696 F. 3d 7, 31, n. 29 (2012), and we\nleave it for the Court of Appeals to consider in the first instance on\nremand.\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n       “(B) disapproves a [SIP] in whole or in part,\n     “unless the State corrects the deficiency, and [EPA]\n     approves the plan or plan revision, before the [Agency]\n     promulgates such [FIP].” §7410(c)(1).\nIn other words, once EPA has found a SIP inadequate, the\nAgency has a statutory duty to issue a FIP “at any time”\nwithin two years (unless the State first “corrects the defi­\nciency,” which no one contends occurred here).\n   The D. C. Circuit, however, found an unwritten excep­\ntion to this strict time prescription for SIPs aimed at\nimplementing the Good Neighbor Provision. Expecting\nany one State to develop a “comprehensive solution” to the\n“collective problem” of interstate air pollution without first\nreceiving EPA’s guidance was, in the Court of Appeals’\nassessment, “set[ting] the States up to fail.” 696 F. 3d, at\n36–37. The D. C. Circuit therefore required EPA, after\npromulgating each State’s emission budget, to give the\nState a “reasonable” period of time to propose SIPs im­\nplementing its budget. See id., at 37.\n   However sensible (or not) the Court of Appeals’ posi­\ntion,13 a reviewing court’s “task is to apply the text [of the\nstatute], not to improve upon it.” Pavelic & LeFlore v.\nMarvel Entertainment Group, Div. of Cadence Industries\nCorp., 493 U. S. 120, 126 (1989). Nothing in the Act dif­\n——————\n   13 On this point, the dissent argues that it is “beyond responsible\n\ndebate that the States cannot possibly design FIP-proof SIPs without\nknowing the EPA-prescribed targets at which they must aim.” Post, at\n18. Many of the State respondents thought otherwise, however, when\nlitigating the matter in Michigan v. EPA, 213 F. 3d 663 (CADC 2000).\nSee Final Brief for Petitioning States in No. 98–1497 (CADC), p. 34\n(“EPA has the responsibility to establish NAAQS,” but without further\nintervention by EPA, “States [have] the duty and right to develop . . .\nSIPs . . . to meet those NAAQS.”). See also id., at 37 (“EPA’s role is to\ndetermine whether the SIP submitted is ‘adequate’ . . . not to dictate\ncontents of the submittal in the first instance. . . . [E]ach State has the\nright and the obligation to write a SIP that complies with §[74]10(a)(2),\nincluding the ‘good neighbor’ provision.”).\n16       EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nferentiates the Good Neighbor Provision from the several\nother matters a State must address in its SIP. Rather, the\nstatute speaks without reservation: Once a NAAQS has\nbeen issued, a State “shall” propose a SIP within three\nyears, §7410(a)(1), and that SIP “shall” include, among\nother components, provisions adequate to satisfy the Good\nNeighbor Provision, §7410(a)(2).\n   Nor does the Act condition the duty to promulgate a FIP\non EPA’s having first quantified an upwind State’s good\nneighbor obligations. As Judge Rogers observed in her\ndissent from the D. C. Circuit’s decision, the Act does not\nrequire EPA to furnish upwind States with information of\nany kind about their good neighbor obligations before a\nFIP issues. See 696 F. 3d, at 47. Instead, a SIP’s failure\nto satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision, without more,\ntriggers EPA’s obligation to issue a federal plan within\ntwo years. §7410(c). After EPA has disapproved a SIP,\nthe Agency can wait up to two years to issue a FIP, during\nwhich time the State can “correc[t] the deficiency” on its\nown. Ibid. But EPA is not obliged to wait two years or\npostpone its action even a single day: The Act empowers\nthe Agency to promulgate a FIP “at any time” within the\ntwo-year limit. Ibid. Carving out an exception to the Act’s\nprecise deadlines, as the D. C. Circuit did, “rewrites a\ndecades-old statute whose plain text and structure estab­\nlish a clear chronology of federal and State responsibili­\nties.” 696 F. 3d, at 47 (Rogers, J., dissenting).\n   The practical difficulties cited by the Court of Appeals\ndo not justify departure from the Act’s plain text. See\nBarnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 461–462\n(2002) (We “must presume that a legislature says in a\nstatute what it means and means in a statute what it says\nthere.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). When Con­\ngress elected to make EPA’s input a prerequisite to state\naction under the Act, it did so expressly. States develop­\ning vehicle inspection and maintenance programs under\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe CAA, for example, must await EPA guidance before\nissuing SIPs. 42 U. S. C. §7511a(c)(3)(B). A State’s obli­\ngation to adopt a SIP, moreover, arises only after EPA has\nfirst set the NAAQS the State must meet. §7410(a)(1).\nHad Congress intended similarly to defer States’ discharge\nof their obligations under the Good Neighbor Provision,\nCongress, we take it, would have included a similar direc­\ntion in that section. See Jama v. Immigration and Cus-\ntoms Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 341 (2005) (“We do not\nlightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted\ntext requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply,\nand our reluctance is even greater when Congress has\nshown elsewhere in the same statute that it knows how to\nmake such a requirement manifest.”).\n   In short, nothing in the statute places EPA under an\nobligation to provide specific metrics to States before they\nundertake to fulfill their good neighbor obligations. By\naltering the schedule Congress provided for SIPs and\nFIPs, the D. C. Circuit stretched out the process. It al­\nlowed a delay Congress did not order and placed an infor­\nmation submission obligation on EPA Congress did not\nimpose. The D. C. Circuit, we hold, had no warrant thus\nto revise the CAA’s action-ordering prescriptions.\n                              C\n   At oral argument, the State respondents emphasized\nEPA’s previous decisions, in the NOX SIP Call and CAIR,\nto quantify the emission reductions required of upwind\nStates before the window to propose a SIP closed. See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 37–39, 42–43, 45–46. In their view, by failing\nto accord States a similar grace period after issuing States’\nemission budgets, EPA acted arbitrarily. See ibid.\n   Whatever pattern the Agency followed in its NOX SIP\ncall and CAIR proceedings, EPA retained discretion to\nalter its course provided it gave a reasonable explanation\nfor doing so. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States,\n18         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nInc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29,\n42 (1983). The Agency presented such an explanation in\nthe Transport Rule. As noted, see supra, at 6, the D. C.\nCircuit’s North Carolina decision admonished EPA to act\nwith dispatch in amending or replacing CAIR, the\nTransport Rule’s predecessor. See 550 F. 3d, at 1178\n(warning EPA that the stay of the court’s decision to va­\ncate CAIR would not persist “indefinite[ly]”). Given North\nCarolina’s stress on expeditious action to cure the infir-\nmities the court identified in CAIR, EPA thought\nit “[in]appropriate to establish [the] lengthy transition\nperiod” entailed in allowing States time to propose new or\namended SIPs implementing the Transport Rule emission\nbudgets. See 76 Fed. Reg. 48220 (citing North Carolina,\n550 F. 3d 1176). Endeavoring to satisfy the D. C. Circuit’s\ndirective, EPA acted speedily, issuing FIPs contemporane­\nously with the Transport Rule. In light of the firm dead­\nlines imposed by the Act, which we hold the D. C. Circuit\nlacked authority to alter, we cannot condemn EPA’s deci­\nsion as arbitrary or capricious.14\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n  The D. C.

Post, at 19. But nothing in the statute so restricts\nEPA. To the contrary, as earlier observed, see supra, at 16, the plain\ntext of the CAA grants EPA plenary authority to issue a FIP “at any\ntime” within the two-year period that begins the moment EPA deter­\nmines a SIP to be inadequate. §7410(c)(1) (emphasis added).\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

See Brief for Federal Petitioners 34–42.\nThis failure at the administrative level, EPA urges, fore­\ncloses judicial review. Id., at 34.\n  Assuming, without deciding, that respondents did not\nmeet the Act’s “reasonable specificity” requirement during\nthe comment period, we do not regard that lapse as “juris­\ndictional.” This Court has cautioned against “profligate\nuse” of the label “jurisdictional.” Sebelius v. Auburn Re-\ngional Medical Center, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op.,\nat 6). A rule may be “mandatory,” yet not “jurisdictional,”\nwe have explained. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 510 (2006). Section 7607(d)(7)(B), we hold, is of that\ncharacter. It does not speak to a court’s authority, but\nonly to a party’s procedural obligations. See Kontrick v.\nRyan, 540 U. S. 443, 455 (2004). Had EPA pursued the\n“reasonable specificity” argument vigorously before the\nD. C. Circuit, we would be obligated to address the merits\nof the argument. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. ___,\n___ (2012) (slip op., at 10). But EPA did not press the\nargument unequivocally. Before the D. C. Circuit, it indi­\ncated only that the “reasonable specificity” prescription\nmight bar judicial review. Brief for Respondent EPA et al.\nin No. 11–1302 (CADC), p. 30. See also id., at 32. We\ntherefore do not count the prescription an impassable\nhindrance to our adjudication of the respondents’ attack\non EPA’s interpretation of the Transport Rule. We turn to\nthat attack mindful of the importance of the issues re­\nspondents raise to the ongoing implementation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision.\n20       EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L.

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), is the pathmarking\ndecision, and it bears a notable resemblance to the cases\nbefore us. Chevron concerned EPA’s definition of the term\n“source,” as used in the 1977 Amendments to the CAA.\nId., at 840, n. 1. Those amendments placed additional\nrestrictions on companies’ liberty to add new pollution\n“sources” to their factories. See id., at 840. Although\n“source” might have been interpreted to refer to an indi­\nvidual smokestack, EPA construed the term to refer to an\nentire plant, thereby “treat[ing] all of the pollution­\nemitting devices within the [plant] as though they were\nencased within a single ‘bubble.’” Ibid. Under the Agency’s\ninterpretation, a new pollution-emitting device would not\nsubject a plant to the additional restrictions if the “altera­\ntion [did] not increase the total emissions [produced by]\nthe plant.” Ibid.\n    This Court held EPA’s interpretation of “source” a rea­\nsonable construction of an ambiguous statutory term.\nWhen “Congress has not directly addressed the precise\n[interpretative] question at issue,” we cautioned, a review­\ning court cannot “simply impose its own construction o[f]\nthe statute.” Id., at 843. Rather, the agency is charged\nwith filling the “gap left open” by the ambiguity. Id., at\n866. Because “ ‘a full understanding of the force of the\nstatutory policy . . . depend[s] upon more than ordinary\nknowledge’ ” of the situation, the administering agency’s\nconstruction is to be accorded “controlling weight unless\n. . . arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the\nstatute.” Id., at 844 (quoting United States v. Shimer, 367\nU. S. 374, 382 (1961)). Determining that none of those\nterms fit EPA’s interpretation of “source,” the Court de­\nferred to the Agency’s judgment.\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 21\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   We conclude that the Good Neighbor Provision delegates\nauthority to EPA at least as certainly as the CAA provi­\nsions involved in Chevron. The statute requires States to\neliminate those “amounts” of pollution that “contribute\nsignificantly to nonattainment” in downwind States. 42\nU. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i) (emphasis added). Thus, EPA’s\ntask15 is to reduce upwind pollution, but only in “amounts”\nthat push a downwind State’s pollution concentrations\nabove the relevant NAAQS. As noted earlier, however, the\nnonattainment of downwind States results from the collec­\ntive and interwoven contributions of multiple upwind\nStates. See supra, at 3. The statute therefore calls\nupon the Agency to address a thorny causation problem:\nHow should EPA allocate among multiple contributing up-\nwind States responsibility for a downwind State’s excess\npollution?\n   A simplified example illustrates the puzzle EPA faced.\nSuppose the Agency sets a NAAQS, with respect to a\nparticular pollutant, at 100 parts per billion (ppb), and\nthat the level of the pollutant in the atmosphere of down­\nwind State A is 130 ppb. Suppose further that EPA has\ndetermined that each of three upwind States—X, Y, and\nZ—contributes the equivalent of 30 ppb of the relevant\npollutant to State A’s airspace. The Good Neighbor Provi­\nsion, as just observed, prohibits only upwind emissions\nthat contribute significantly to downwind nonattainment.\nEPA’s authority under the provision is therefore limited to\neliminating a total of 30 ppb,16 i.e., the overage caused by\n\n——————\n  15 Though we speak here of “EPA’s task,” the Good Neighbor Provi­\n\nsion is initially directed to upwind States. As earlier explained, see\nPart II–B, supra, only after a State has failed to propose a SIP ade­\nquate for compliance with the provision is EPA called upon to act.\n  16 Because of the uncertainties inherent in measuring interstate air\n\npollution, see supra, at 3–4, reductions of exactly 30 ppb likely are\nunattainable. See infra, at 30–31.\n22         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe collective contribution of States X, Y, and Z.17\n   How is EPA to divide responsibility among the three\nStates? Should the Agency allocate reductions propor­\ntionally (10 ppb each), on a per capita basis, on the basis of\nthe cost of abatement, or by some other metric? See Brief\nfor Federal Petitioners 50 (noting EPA’s consideration of\ndifferent approaches). The Good Neighbor Provision does\nnot answer that question for EPA. Cf. Chevron, 467 U. S.,\nat 860 (“[T]he language of [the CAA] simply does not\ncompel any given interpretation of the term ‘source.’ ”).\nUnder Chevron, we read Congress’ silence as a delegation\nof authority to EPA to select from among reasonable op­\ntions. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229\n(2001).18\n   Yet the Court of Appeals believed that the Act speaks\nclearly, requiring EPA to allocate responsibility for reduc­\ning emissions in “a manner proportional to” each State’s\n“contributio[n]” to the problem. 696 F. 3d, at 21. Nothing\n——————\n  17 For  simplicity’s sake, the hypothetical assumes that EPA has not\nrequired any emission reductions by the downwind State itself.\n   18 The statutory gap identified also exists in the Good Neighbor Provi­\n\nsion’s second instruction. That instruction requires EPA to eliminate\namounts of upwind pollution that “interfere with maintenance” of a\nNAAQS by a downwind State. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i). This mandate con­\ntains no qualifier analogous to “significantly,” and yet it entails a\ndelegation of administrative authority of the same character as the one\ndiscussed above. Just as EPA is constrained, under the first part of the\nGood Neighbor Provision, to eliminate only those amounts that “con­\ntribute . . . to nonattainment,” EPA is limited, by the second part of the\nprovision, to reduce only by “amounts” that “interfere with mainte-\nnance,” i.e., by just enough to permit an already-attaining State to\nmaintain satisfactory air quality. (Emphasis added.) With multiple\nupwind States contributing to the maintenance problem, however, EPA\nconfronts the same challenge that the “contribute significantly” man­\ndate creates: How should EPA allocate reductions among multiple\nupwind States, many of which contribute in amounts sufficient to\nimpede downwind maintenance? Nothing in either clause of the Good\nNeighbor Provision provides the criteria by which EPA is meant to\napportion responsibility.\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin the text of the Good Neighbor Provision propels EPA\ndown this path. Understandably so, for as EPA notes, the\nD. C. Circuit’s proportionality approach could scarcely be\nsatisfied in practice. See App. in No. 11–1302 etc.\n(CADC), p. 2312 (“[W]hile it is possible to determine an\nemission reduction percentage if there is a single down­\nwind [receptor], most upwind states contribute to multiple\ndownwind [receptors] (in multiple states) and would have\na different reduction percentage for each one.”).\n  To illustrate, consider a variation on the example set out\nabove. Imagine that States X and Y now contribute air\npollution to State A in a ratio of one to five, i.e., State Y\ncontributes five times the amount of pollution to State A\nthan does State X. If State A were the only downwind\nState to which the two upwind States contributed, the\nD. C. Circuit’s proportionality requirement would be easy\nto meet: EPA could require State Y to reduce its emissions\nby five times the amount demanded of State X.\n  The realities of interstate air pollution, however, are not\nso simple. Most upwind States contribute pollution to\nmultiple downwind States in varying amounts. See 76\nFed. Reg. 48239–48246. See also Brief for Respondent\nCalpine Corp. et al. in Support of Petitioners 48–49 (offer­\ning examples). Suppose then that States X and Y also\ncontribute pollutants to a second downwind State (State\nB), this time in a ratio of seven to one. Though State Y\ncontributed a relatively larger share of pollution to State\nA, with respect to State B, State X is the greater offender.\nFollowing the proportionality approach with respect to\nState B would demand that State X reduce its emissions\nby seven times as much as State Y. Recall, however, that\nState Y, as just hypothesized, had to effect five times as\nlarge a reduction with respect to State A. The Court of\nAppeals’ proportionality edict with respect to both State A\nand State B appears to work neither mathematically nor\nin practical application. Proportionality as to one down­\n24         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwind State will not achieve proportionality as to others.\nQuite the opposite. And where, as is generally true, up­\nwind States contribute pollution to more than two down­\nwind receptors, proportionality becomes all the more\nelusive.\n  Neither the D. C. Circuit nor respondents face up to this\nproblem. The dissent, for its part, strains to give meaning\nto the D. C. Circuit’s proportionality constraint as applied\nto a world in which multiple upwind States contribute\nemissions to multiple downwind locations. In the dissent’s\nview, upwind States must eliminate emissions by “what­\never minimum amount reduces” their share of the overage\nin each and every one of the downwind States to which\nthey are linked. See post, at 8. In practical terms, this\nmeans each upwind State will be required to reduce emis­\nsions by the amount necessary to eliminate that State’s\nlargest downwind contribution. The dissent’s formulation,\nhowever, does not account for the combined and cumu-\nlative effect of each upwind State’s reductions on attain­\nment in multiple downwind locations. See ibid. (“Under a\nproportional-reduction approach, State X would be required\nto eliminate emissions of that pollutant by whatever min­\nimum amount reduces both State A’s level by 0.2 unit and\nState B’s by 0.7 unit.” (emphasis added)). The result\nwould be costly overregulation unnecessary to, indeed\nin conflict with, the Good Neighbor Provision’s goal of\nattainment.19\n——————\n  19 To see why, one need only slightly complicate the world envisioned\n\nby the dissent. Assume the world is made up of only four States—two\nupwind (States X and Y), and two downwind (States A and B). Suppose\nalso, as the dissent allows, see post, at 9, that the reductions State X\nmust make to eliminate its share of the amount by which State A is in\nnonattainment are more than necessary for State X to eliminate its\nshare of State B’s nonattainment. As later explained, see infra, at 29–\n30, this kind of “over-control,” we agree with the dissent, is acceptable\nunder the statute. Suppose, however, that State Y also contributes to\npollution in both State A and State B such that the reductions it must\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  25\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   In response, the dissent asserts that EPA will “simply\nbe required to make allowance for” the overregulation\ncaused by its “proportional-reduction” approach. Post, at\n11. What criterion should EPA employ to determine\nwhich States will have to make those “allowance[s]” and\nby how much? The dissent admits there are “multiple\nways” EPA might answer those questions. Ibid. But\nproportionality cannot be one of those ways, for the\nproportional-reduction approach is what led to the over­\nregulation in the first place. And if a nonproportional\napproach can play a role in setting the final allocation of\nreduction obligations, then it is hardly apparent why EPA,\nfree to depart from proportionality at the back end, cannot\ndo so at the outset.\n   Persuaded that the Good Neighbor Provision does not\ndictate the particular allocation of emissions among con­\ntributing States advanced by the D. C. Circuit, we must\nnext decide whether the allocation method chosen by EPA\nis a “permissible construction of the statute.” Chevron,\n467 U. S., at 843. As EPA interprets the statute, upwind\nemissions rank as “amounts [that] . . . contribute signifi­\ncantly to nonattainment” if they (1) constitute one percent\n——————\nmake to eliminate its proportion of State B’s overage exceed the reduc­\ntions it must make to bring State A into attainment. In this case, the\ndissent would have State X reduce by just enough to eliminate its share\nof State A’s nonattainment and more than enough to eliminate its\nshare of State B’s overage. The converse will be true as to State Y:\nUnder the dissent’s approach, State Y would have to reduce by the\n“minimum” necessary to eliminate its proportional share of State B’s\nnonattainment and more than enough to eliminate its proportion of\nState A’s overage. The result is that the total amount by which both\nStates X and Y are required to reduce will exceed what is necessary for\nattainment in all downwind States involved (i.e., in both State A and\nState B). Over-control thus unnecessary to achieving attainment in all\ninvolved States is impermissible under the Good Neighbor Provision.\nSee infra, at 30, n. 23. The problem would worsen were the hypothet­\nical altered to include more than two downwind States and two upwind\nStates, the very real circumstances EPA must address.\n26       EPA v.

Reg. 48254. In other\nwords, to identify which emissions were to be eliminated,\nEPA considered both the magnitude of upwind States’\ncontributions and the cost associated with eliminating\nthem.\n   The Industry respondents argue that, however EPA\nultimately divides responsibility among upwind States,\nthe final calculation cannot rely on costs. The Good\nNeighbor Provision, respondents and the dissent empha­\nsize, “requires each State to prohibit only those ‘amounts’\nof air pollution emitted within the State that ‘contribute\nsignificantly’ to another State’s nonattaintment.” Brief for\nIndustry Respondents 23 (emphasis added). See also post,\nat 6. The cost of preventing emissions, they urge, is\nwholly unrelated to the actual “amoun[t]” of air pollution\nan upwind State contributes. Brief for Industry Respond­\nents 23. Because the Transport Rule considers costs,\nrespondents argue, “States that contribute identical\n‘amounts’ . . . may be deemed [by EPA] to have [made]\nsubstantially different” contributions. Id., at 30.\n   But, as just explained, see supra, at 21–22, the Agency\ncannot avoid the task of choosing which among equal\n“amounts” to eliminate. The Agency has chosen, sensibly\nin our view, to reduce the amount easier, i.e., less costly, to\neradicate, and nothing in the text of the Good Neighbor\nProvision precludes that choice.\n   Using costs in the Transport Rule calculus, we agree\nwith EPA, also makes good sense. Eliminating those\namounts that can cost-effectively be reduced is an efficient\nand equitable solution to the allocation problem the Good\nNeighbor Provision requires the Agency to address. Effi­\ncient because EPA can achieve the levels of attainment,\ni.e., of emission reductions, the proportional approach\naims to achieve, but at a much lower overall cost.

Upwind States that have not yet\nimplemented pollution controls of the same stringency as\ntheir neighbors will be stopped from free riding on their\nneighbors’ efforts to reduce pollution. They will have to\nbring down their emissions by installing devices of the\nkind in which neighboring States have already invested.\n   Suppose, for example, that the industries of upwind\nState A have expended considerable resources installing\nmodern pollution-control devices on their plants. Facto­\nries in upwind State B, by contrast, continue to run old,\ndirty plants. Yet, perhaps because State A is more popu­\nlous and therefore generates a larger sum of pollution\noverall, the two States’ emissions have equal effects on\ndownwind attainment. If State A and State B are re­\nquired to eliminate emissions proportionally (i.e., equally),\nsources in State A will be compelled to spend far more per\nton of reductions because they have already utilized lower\ncost pollution controls. State A’s sources will also have to\nachieve greater reductions than would have been required\nhad they not made the cost-effective reductions in the first\nplace. State A, in other words, will be tolled for having\ndone more to reduce pollution in the past.20 EPA’s cost­\nbased allocation avoids these anomalies.\n   Obligated to require the elimination of only those\n“amounts” of pollutants that contribute to the nonattain­\nment of NAAQS in downwind States, EPA must decide\nhow to differentiate among the otherwise like contribu­\ntions of multiple upwind States. EPA found decisive the\n——————\n  20 The dissent’s approach is similarly infirm. It, too, would toll those\n\nupwind States that have already invested heavily in means to reduce\nthe pollution their industries cause, while lightening the burden on\nStates that have done relatively less to control pollution emanating\nfrom local enterprises.\n28         EPA v.

S., at 866.21\n                              C\n   The D. C. Circuit stated two further objections to EPA’s\ncost-based method of defining an upwind State’s contribu­\ntion. Once a State was screened in at step one of EPA’s\nanalysis, its emission budget was calculated solely with\nreference to the uniform cost thresholds the Agency selected\nat step two. The Transport Rule thus left open the\npossibility that a State might be compelled to reduce\nemissions beyond the point at which every affected down­\nwind State is in attainment, a phenomenon the Court of\nAppeals termed “over-control.” 696 F. 3d, at 22; see supra,\nat 12.

American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457 (2001). In\nWhitman, we held that the relevant text of the CAA “unambiguously\nbars” EPA from considering costs when determining a NAAQS. Id., at\n471. Section 7409(b)(1) commands EPA to set NAAQS at levels “requi­\nsite to protect the public health” with “an adequate margin of safety.”\nThis mandate, we observed in Whitman, was “absolute,” and precluded\nany other consideration (e.g., cost) in the NAAQS calculation. Id., at\n465 (internal quotation marks omitted). Not so of the Good Neighbor\nProvision, which grants EPA discretion to eliminate “amounts [of\npollution that] . . . contribute significantly to nonattainment” down­\nwind. On the particular “amounts” that should qualify for elimination,\nthe statute is silent. Unlike the provision at issue in Whitman, which\nprovides express criteria by which EPA is to set NAAQS, the Good\nNeighbor Provision, as earlier explained, fails to provide any metric by\nwhich EPA can differentiate among the contributions of multiple\nupwind States. See supra, at 21–22.\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

If EPA requires an upwind State to\nreduce emissions by more than the amount necessary to\nachieve attainment in every downwind State to which it is\nlinked, the Agency will have overstepped its authority,\nunder the Good Neighbor Provision, to eliminate those\n“amounts [that] contribute . . . to nonattainment.” Nor\ncan EPA demand reductions that would drive an upwind\nState’s contribution to every downwind State to which it is\nlinked below one percent of the relevant NAAQS. Doing\nso would be counter to step one of the Agency’s interpreta­\ntion of the Good Neighbor Provision. See 76 Fed. Reg.\n48236 (“[S]tates whose contributions are below th[e]\nthresholds do not significantly contribute to nonattain­\nment . . . of the relevant NAAQS.”).\n   Neither possibility, however, justifies wholesale invali­\ndation of the Transport Rule. First, instances of “over­\ncontrol” in particular downwind locations, the D. C. Cir­\ncuit acknowledged, see 696 F. 3d, at 22, may be incidental\nto reductions necessary to ensure attainment elsewhere.\nBecause individual upwind States often “contribute signif­\nicantly” to nonattainment in multiple downwind locations,\nthe emissions reduction required to bring one linked\ndownwind State into attainment may well be large enough\nto push other linked downwind States over the attainment\nline.22 As the Good Neighbor Provision seeks attainment\n——————\n  22 The following example, based on the record, is offered in Brief for\n\nRespondent Calpine Corp. et al. in Support of Petitioners 52–54.

P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nin every downwind State, however, exceeding attainment\nin one State cannot rank as “over-control” unless unneces­\nsary to achieving attainment in any downwind State.\nOnly reductions unnecessary to downwind attainment\nanywhere fall outside the Agency’s statutory authority.23\n  Second, while EPA has a statutory duty to avoid over­\ncontrol, the Agency also has a statutory obligation to avoid\n“under-control,” i.e., to maximize achievement of attain­\nment downwind. For reasons earlier explained, see supra,\nat 3–4, a degree of imprecision is inevitable in tackling the\nproblem of interstate air pollution. Slight changes in wind\npatterns or energy consumption, for example, may vary\ndownwind air quality in ways EPA might not have antici­\npated. The Good Neighbor Provision requires EPA to seek\n——————\nWest Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Indiana each contribute in varying\namounts to five different nonattainment areas in three downwind\nStates. Id., at 52. Implementation of the Transport Rule, EPA model­\ning demonstrates, will bring three of these five areas into attainment\nby a comfortable margin, and a fourth only barely. See id., at 53, fig. 2.\nThe fifth downwind receptor, however, will still fall short of attainment\ndespite the reductions the rule requires. See ibid. But if EPA were to\nlower the emission reductions required of the upwind States to reduce\nover-attainment in the first three areas, the area barely achieving\nattainment would no longer do so, and the area still in nonattainment\nwould fall even further behind. Thus, “over-control” of the first three\ndownwind receptors is essential to the attainment achieved by the\nfourth and to the fifth’s progress toward that goal.\n   23 The dissent suggests that our qualification of the term “over­\n\ncontrol” is tantamount to an admission that “nothing stands in the way\nof [a] proportional-reduction approach.” Post, at 9. Not so. Permitting\n“over-control” as to one State for the purpose of achieving attainment in\nanother furthers the stated goal of the Good Neighbor Provision, i.e.,\nattainment of NAAQS. By contrast, a proportional-reduction scheme is\nneither necessary to achieve downwind attainment, nor mandated by\nthe terms of the statute, as earlier discussed, see supra, at 21–25.\nPermitting “over-control” for the purpose of achieving proportionality\nwould thus contravene the clear limits the statute places on EPA’s good\nneighbor authority, i.e., to eliminate only those “amounts” of upwind\npollutants essential to achieving attainment downwind.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

Hence, some amount of over-control, i.e.,\nemission budgets that turn out to be more demanding\nthan necessary, would not be surprising. Required to\nbalance the possibilities of under-control and over-control,\nEPA must have leeway in fulfilling its statutory mandate.\n   Finally, in a voluminous record, involving thousands of\nupwind-to-downwind linkages, respondents point to only a\nfew instances of “unnecessary” emission reductions, and\neven those are contested by EPA. Compare Brief for\nIndustry Respondents 19 with Reply Brief for Federal\nPetitioners 21–22.

Compare Brief\nfor Federal Petitioners 37, 54–55, with Brief for Industry\nRespondents 40.\n   If any upwind State concludes it has been forced to\nregulate emissions below the one-percent threshold or\nbeyond the point necessary to bring all downwind States\ninto attainment, that State may bring a particularized, as­\napplied challenge to the Transport Rule, along with any\nother as-applied challenges it may have.

With the statute\ninvolved in the present cases, however, Congress did it\nright. It specified quite precisely the responsibility of an\nupwind State under the Good Neighbor Provision: to\neliminate those amounts of pollutants that it contributes\nto downwind problem areas. But the Environmental\nProtection Agency was unsatisfied with this system.\nAgency personnel, perhaps correctly, thought it more\nefficient to require reductions not in proportion to the\namounts of pollutants for which each upwind State is\nresponsible, but on the basis of how cost-effectively each\ncan decrease emissions.\n2          EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  Today, the majority approves that undemocratic revi­\nsion of the Clean Air Act. The Agency came forward with\na textual justification for its action, relying on a farfetched\nmeaning of the word “significantly” in the statutory text.\nThat justification is so feeble that today’s majority does\nnot even recite it, much less defend it. The majority\nreaches its result (“Look Ma, no hands!”) without benefit\nof text, claiming to have identified a remarkable “gap” in\nthe statute, which it proceeds to fill (contrary to the plain\nlogic of the statute) with cost-benefit analysis—and then,\nwith no pretended textual justification at all, simply ex­\ntends cost-benefit analysis beyond the scope of the alleged\ngap.\n  Additionally, the majority relieves EPA of any obligation\nto announce novel interpretations of the Good Neighbor\nProvision before the States must submit plans that are\nrequired to comply with those interpretations. By accord­\ning the States primacy in deciding how to attain the gov­\nerning air-quality standards, the Clean Air Act is preg­\nnant with an obligation for the Agency to set those\nstandards before the States can be expected to achieve\nthem. The majority nonetheless approves EPA’s promul­\ngation of federal plans implementing good-neighbor\nbenchmarks before the States could conceivably have met\nthose benchmarks on their own.\n  I would affirm the judgment of the D. C. Circuit that\nEPA violated the law both in crafting the Transport Rule\nand in implementing it.1\n                     I. The Transport Rule\n   “It is axiomatic that an administrative agency’s power to\npromulgate legislative regulations is limited to the author­\nity delegated by Congress.” Bowen v. Georgetown Univ.\n\n——————\n  1 I agree with the majority’s analysis turning aside EPA’s threshold\n\nobjections to judicial review. See ante, at 13–14, 18–19.\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

Yet today the major-\nity treats the text of the Clean Air Act not as the source\nand ceiling of EPA’s authority to regulate interstate air\npollution, but rather as a difficulty to be overcome in\npursuit of the Agency’s responsibility to “craf[t] a solution\nto the problem of interstate air pollution.” Ante, at 3. In\nreality, Congress itself has crafted the solution. The Good\nNeighbor Provision requires each State to eliminate what­\never “amounts” of “air pollutant[s]” “contribute significantly\nto nonattainment” or “interfere with maintenance” of\nnational ambient air-quality standards (NAAQS) in other\nStates. 42 U. S. C. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The statute ad­\ndresses solely the environmental consequences of emis­\nsions, not the facility of reducing them; and it requires\nStates to shoulder burdens in proportion to the size of\ntheir contributions, not in proportion to the ease of bearing\nthem. EPA’s utterly fanciful “from each according to its\nability” construction sacrifices democratically adopted text\nto bureaucratically favored policy. It deserves no defer­\nence under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).\n         A. Alleged Textual Support: “Significantly”\n   In the Government’s argument here, the asserted tex­\ntual support for the efficient-reduction approach adopted by\nEPA in the Transport Rule is the ambiguity of the word\n“significantly” in the statutory requirement that each\nState eliminate those “amounts” of pollutants that “con­\ntribute significantly to nonattainment” in downwind\nStates. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) (emphasis added). As de­\nscribed in the Government’s briefing:\n    “[T]he term ‘significantly’ . . . is ambiguous, and . . .\n    EPA may permissibly determine the amount of a\n    State’s ‘significant’ contribution by reference to the\n    amount of emissions reductions achievable through\n    application of highly cost-effective controls.” Reply\n4        EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n    Brief for Federal Petitioners 15–16 (emphasis added;\n    some internal quotation marks omitted).\nAnd as the Government stated at oral argument:\n    “[I]n terms of the language, ‘contribute significantly,’\n    . . . EPA reasonably construed that term to include a\n    component of difficulty of achievement [i.e., cost]; that\n    is, in common parlance, we might say that dunking a\n    basketball is a more significant achievement for\n    somebody who is 5 feet 10 than for somebody who is 6\n    feet 10.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 9 (emphasis added).\n   But of course the statute does not focus on whether the\nupwind State has “achieved significantly”; it asks whether\nthe State has “contributed significantly” to downwind\npollution. The provision addresses the physical effects of\nphysical causes, and it is only the magnitude of the rela­\ntionship sufficient to trigger regulation that admits of\nsome vagueness. Stated differently, the statute is ambig­\nuous as to how much of a contribution to downwind pollu­\ntion is “significant,” but it is not at all ambiguous as to\nwhether factors unrelated to the amounts of pollutants\nthat make up a contribution affect the analysis. Just as\n“[i]t does not matter whether the word ‘yellow’ is ambigu­\nous when the agency has interpreted it to mean ‘purple,’ ”\nUnited States v. Home Concrete & Supply, LLC, 566 U. S.\n___, ___, n. 1 (2012) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2, n. 1), it does not\nmatter whether the phrase “amounts which . . . contribute\nsignificantly [to downwind NAAQS nonattainment]” is\nambiguous when EPA has interpreted it to mean\n“amounts which are inexpensive to eliminate.”\n   It would be extraordinary for Congress, by use of the\nsingle word “significantly,” to transmogrify a statute that\nassigns responsibility on the basis of amounts of pollut­\nants emitted into a statute authorizing EPA to reduce\ninterstate pollution in the manner that it believes most\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nefficient. We have repeatedly said that Congress “does not\nalter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in\nvague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not, one\nmight say, hide elephants in mouseholes.” Whitman v.\nAmerican Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001)\n(citing MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Tele-\nphone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 231 (1994); FDA v.\nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 159–\n160 (2000)).\n   The statute’s history demonstrates that “significantly” is\nnot code for “feel free to consider compliance costs.” The\nprevious version of the Good Neighbor Provision required\neach State to prohibit emissions that would “prevent at­\ntainment or maintenance by any other State of any\n[NAAQS].” 91 Stat. 693 (emphasis added). It is evident\nthat the current reformulation (targeting “any air pollut-\nant in amounts which will . . . contribute significantly to\nnonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any\nother State with respect to any [NAAQS]”) was meant\nsimply to eliminate any implication that the polluting\nState had to be a but-for rather than merely a contributing\ncause of the downwind nonattainment or maintenance\nproblem—not to allow cost concerns to creep in through\nthe back door.\n   In another respect also EPA’s reliance upon the word\n“significantly” is plainly mistaken. The Good Neighbor\nProvision targets for elimination not only those emissions\nthat “contribute significantly to nonattainment [of\nNAAQS] in . . . any other State,” but also those that “inter­\nfere with maintenance [of NAAQS] by . . . any other\nState.” §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The wiggle-word “significantly”\nis absent from the latter phrase.         EPA does not—\ncannot—provide any textual justification for the conclu­\nsion that, when the same amounts of a pollutant travel\ndownwind from States X and Y to a single area in State A,\nthe emissions from X but not Y can be said to “interfere\n6        EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwith maintenance” of the NAAQS in A just because they\nare cheaper to eliminate. Yet EPA proposes to use the\n“from each according to its ability” approach for nonat­\ntainment areas and maintenance areas.\n   To its credit, the majority does not allude to, much less\ntry to defend, the Government’s “significantly” argument.\nBut there is a serious downside to this. The sky-hook of\n“significantly” was called into service to counter the crite­\nrion of upwind-state responsibility plainly provided in the\nstatute’s text: amounts of pollutants contributed to down­\nwind problem areas. See Brief for Federal Petitioners 42–\n45. Having forsworn reliance on “significantly” to convert\nresponsibility for amounts of pollutants into responsibility\nfor easy reduction of pollutants, the majority is impaled\nupon the statutory text.\n                    B. The Alleged “Gap”\n   To fill the void created by its abandonment of EPA’s\n“significantly” argument, the majority identifies a sup­\nposed gap in the text, which EPA must fill: While the text\nsays that each upwind State must be responsible for its\nown contribution to downwind pollution, it does not say\nhow responsibility is to be divided among multiple States\nwhen the total of their combined contribution to downwind\npollution in a particular area exceeds the reduction that\nthe relevant NAAQS requires. In the example given by\nthe majority, ante, at 21–22, when each of three upwind\nStates contributes 30 units of a pollutant to a downwind\nState but the reduction required for that State to comply\nwith the NAAQS is only 30 units, how will responsibility\nfor that 30 units be apportioned? Wow, that’s a hard\none—almost the equivalent of asking who is buried in\nGrant’s Tomb. If the criterion of responsibility is amounts\nof pollutants, then surely shared responsibility must be\nbased upon relative amounts of pollutants—in the major­\nity’s example, 10 units for each State. The statute makes\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nno sense otherwise. The Good Neighbor Provision con­\ntains a gap only for those who blind themselves to the\nobvious in order to pursue a preferred policy.\n   But not only does the majority bring in cost-benefit\nanalysis to fill a gap that does not really exist. Having\nfilled that “gap,” it then extends the efficiency-based prin­\nciple to situations beyond the imaginary gap—that is,\nsituations where no apportionment is required. Even\nwhere an upwind State contributes pollutants to only a\nsingle downwind State, its annual emissions “budget” will\nbe based not upon the amounts of pollutants it contrib­\nutes, but upon what “pollution controls [are] available at\nthe chosen cost thresholds.” Ante, at 9. EPA’s justification\nwas its implausible (and only half-applicable) notion that\n“significantly” imports cost concerns into the provision.\nThe majority, having abandoned that absurdity, is left to\ndeal with the no-apportionment situation with no de­\nfense—not even an imaginary gap—against a crystal-clear\nstatutory text.\n   C. The Majority’s Criticisms of Proportional Reduction\n                      1. Impossibility\n   The majority contends that a proportional-reduction\napproach “could scarcely be satisfied in practice” and\n“appears to work neither mathematically nor in practical\napplication, ante, at 23—in essence, that the approach is\nimpossible of application. If that were true, I know of no\nlegal authority and no democratic principle that would\nderive from it the consequence that EPA could rewrite the\nstatute, rather than the consequence that the statute\nwould be inoperative. “There are sometimes statutes\nwhich no rule or canon of interpretation can make effec­\ntive or applicable to the situations of fact which they\npurport to govern. In such cases the statute must simply\nfail.” 3 R. Pound, Jurisprudence 493 (1959) (footnote\nomitted). In other words, the impossibility argument has\n8         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nno independent force: It is relevant only if the majority’s\ntextual interpretation is permissible. But in any event,\nthe argument is wrong.\n  The impossibility theorem rests upon the following\nscenario: “Imagine that States X and Y . . . contribute air\npollution to State A in a ratio of one to five . . . .” Ante, at\n23. And suppose that “States X and Y also contribute\npollutants to a second downwind State (State B), this time\nin a ratio of seven to one.” Ibid. The majority concludes\nthat “[t]he Court of Appeals’ proportionality edict with\nrespect to both State A and State B appears to work nei­\nther mathematically nor in practical application.” Ibid.\nBut why not? The majority’s model relies on two faulty\npremises—one an oversimplification and the other a mis­\napprehension.\n  First, the majority’s formulation suggests that EPA\nmeasures the comparative downwind drift of pollutants in\nfree-floating proportions between States. In reality, how­\never, EPA assesses quantities (in physical units), not\nproportions. So, the majority’s illustration of a 1-to-5 ratio\ndescribing the relative contributions of States X and Y to\nState A’s pollution might mean (for example) that X is\nresponsible for 0.2 unit of some pollutant above the\nNAAQS in A and that Y is responsible for 1 unit. And\nthe second example, assuming a 7-to-1 ratio underlying\nState X’s and Y’s contributions to State B’s pollution,\nmight mean that State X supplies 0.7 unit of the same pol­\nlutant above the NAAQS and State Y, 0.1 unit. Under a\nproportional-reduction approach, State X would be re­\nquired to eliminate emissions of that pollutant by what-\never minimum amount reduces both State A’s level by 0.2\nunit and State B’s by 0.7 unit. State Y, in turn, would be\nrequired to curtail its emissions by whatever minimum\namount decreases both State A’s measure by 1 unit and\nState B’s by 0.1 unit.\n  But, the majority objects, the reductions that State X\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmust make to help bring State B into compliance may be\nmore than those necessary for it to help bring State A into\ncompliance, resulting in “over-control” of X with respect to\nA. See ante, at 23–25, and n. 19. This objection discloses\nthe second flaw in the impossibility theorem. Echoing\nEPA, see Brief for Federal Petitioners 47–48, the majority\nbelieves that the D. C. Circuit’s interpretation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision forbids over-control with respect to\neven a single downwind receptor. That is the only way in\nwhich the proportional-reduction approach could be\ndeemed “to work neither mathematically nor in practical\napplication” on its face. Ante, at 23. But the premise is\nincorrect. Although some of the D. C. Circuit’s simplified\nexamples might support that conclusion, its opinion explic­\nitly acknowledged that the complexity of real-world condi­\ntions demands the contrary: “To be sure, . . . there may be\nsome truly unavoidable over-control in some downwind\nStates that occurs as a byproduct of the necessity of reduc­\ning upwind States’ emissions enough to meet the NAAQS\nin other downwind States.” 696 F. 3d 7, 22 (2012). More­\nover, the majority itself recognizes that the Good Neighbor\nProvision does not categorically prohibit over-control. “As\nthe Good Neighbor Provision seeks attainment in every\ndownwind State, . . . exceeding attainment in one State\ncannot rank as ‘over-control’ unless unnecessary to achiev­\ning attainment in any downwind State.” Ante, at 29–30.\nThe majority apparently fails to appreciate that, having\ncleared up that potential point of confusion, nothing\nstands in the way of the proportional-reduction approach.\n   The majority relies on an EPA document preceding the\nTransport Rule to establish the Agency’s supposed belief\nthat the proportional-reduction approach “could scarcely\nbe satisfied in practice.” Ante, at 23. But the document\nsays no such thing. Rather, it shows that the Agency\nrejected a proportion-based, “air[-]quality-only” methodol­\nogy not because it was impossible of application, but be­\n10       EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncause it failed to account for costs. See App. in No. 11–\n1302 etc. (CADC), pp. 2311–2312. The document labels as\na “technical difficulty” (not an impossibility) the fact that\n“most upwind states contribute to multiple downwind\n[receptors] (in multiple states) and would have a different\nreduction percentage for each one.” Id., at 2312. The\nClean Air Act is full of technical difficulties, and this one\nis overcome by requiring each State to make the greatest\nreduction necessary with respect to any downwind area.\n                       2. Over-Control\n   Apparently conceding that the proportional-reduction\napproach may not be impossible of application after all,\nthe majority alternatively asserts that it would cause\n“costly overregulation unnecessary to, indeed in conflict\nwith, the Good Neighbor Provision’s goal of attainment.”\nAnte, at 24. This assertion of massive overregulation\nassumes that a vast number of downwind States will be\nthe accidental beneficiaries of collateral pollution reduc­\ntions—that is, nontargeted reductions that occur as a\nconsequence of required reductions targeted at neighbor­\ning downwind States. (Collateral pollution reduction is\nthe opposite of collateral damage, so to speak.) The major­\nity contends that the collateral pollution reductions en­\njoyed by a downwind State will cause the required upwind\nreductions actually targeting that State to exceed the level\nnecessary to assure attainment or maintenance, thus\nproducing unnecessary over-control. I have no reason to\nbelieve that the problem of over-control is as extensive and\nthus “costly” as the majority alleges, and the majority\nprovides none.\n   But never mind that. It suffices to say that over-control\nis no more likely to occur when the required reductions are\napportioned among upwind States on the basis of amounts\nof pollutants contributed than when they are apportioned\non the basis of cost. There is no conceivable reason why\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 11\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe efficient-reduction States that bear the brunt of the\nmajority’s (and EPA’s) approach are less likely to be over­\ncontrolled than the major-pollution-causing States that\nwould bear the brunt of my (and the statute’s) approach.\nIndeed, EPA never attempted to establish that the\nTransport Rule did not produce gross over-control. See\n696 F. 3d, at 27. What causes the problem of over-control\nis not the manner of apportioning the required reductions,\nbut the composite volume of the required reductions in\neach downwind State. If the majority’s approach reduces\nover-control (it admittedly does not entirely eliminate it),\nthat is only because EPA applies its cost-effectiveness\nprinciple not just to determining the proportions of re­\nquired reductions that each upwind State must bear, but\nto determining the volume of those required reductions.\nSee supra, at 7.\n   In any case, the solution to over-control under a propor­\ntional-reduction system is not difficult to discern. In\ncalculating good-neighbor responsibilities, EPA would\nsimply be required to make allowance for what I have\ncalled collateral pollution reductions. The Agency would\nset upwind States’ obligations at levels that, after taking\ninto account those reductions, suffice to produce attain­\nment in all downwind States. Doubtless, there are multi­\nple ways for the Agency to accomplish that task in accord­\nance with the statute’s amounts-based, proportional\nfocus.2 The majority itself invokes an unexplained device\nto prevent over-control “in uncommon particular applica­\ntions” of its scheme. Ante, at 31. Whatever that device is,\nit can serve just as well to prevent over-control under the\napproach I have outlined.\n——————\n  2 The majority insists that “proportionality cannot be one of those\n\nways.” Ante, at 25. But it is easy to imagine precluding unnecessary\nover-control by reducing in a percent-based manner the burdens of each\nupwind State linked to a given downwind area, which would retain the\nproportionality produced by my approach.\n12       EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   I fully acknowledge that the proportional-reduction\napproach will demand some complicated computations\nwhere one upwind State is linked to multiple downwind\nStates and vice versa. I am confident, however, that\nEPA’s skilled number-crunchers can adhere to the stat­\nute’s quantitative (rather than efficiency) mandate by\ncrafting quantitative solutions. Indeed, those calculations\ncan be performed at the desk, whereas the “from each\naccording to its ability” approach requires the unwieldy\nfield examination of many pollution-producing sources\nwith many sorts of equipment.\n                      D. Plus Ça Change: \n\n     EPA’s Continuing Quest for Cost-Benefit Authority \n\n   The majority agrees with EPA’s assessment that\n“[u]sing costs in the Transport Rule calculus . . . makes\ngood sense.” Ante, at 26. Its opinion declares that\n“[e]liminating those amounts that can cost-effectively be\nreduced is an efficient and equitable solution to the alloca­\ntion problem the Good Neighbor Provision requires the\nAgency to address.” Ibid. Efficient, probably. Equitable?\nPerhaps so, but perhaps not. See Brief for Industry Re­\nspondents 35–36. But the point is that whether efficiency\nshould have a dominant or subordinate role is not for EPA\nor this Court to determine.\n   This is not the first time EPA has sought to convert the\nClean Air Act into a mandate for cost-effective regulation.\nWhitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457\n(2001), confronted EPA’s contention that it could consider\ncosts in setting NAAQS. The provision at issue there, like\nthis one, did not expressly bar cost-based decisionmak­\ning—and unlike this one, it even contained words that\nwere arguably ambiguous in the relevant respect. Specifi­\ncally, §7409(b)(1) instructed EPA to set primary NAAQS\n“the attainment and maintenance of which . . . are requi­\nsite to protect the public health” with “an adequate margin\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

As the respondents in American Trucking\nargued, setting NAAQS without considering costs may\nbring about failing industries and fewer jobs, which in\nturn may produce poorer and less healthy citizens. See\nid., at 466. But we concluded that “in the context of ” the\nentire provision, that interpretation “ma[de] no sense.”\nIbid. As quoted earlier, we said that Congress “does not\nalter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in\nvague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not . . . hide\nelephants in mouseholes.” Id., at 468.\n   In American Trucking, the Court “refused to find im­\nplicit in ambiguous sections of the [Clear Air Act] an\nauthorization to consider costs that has elsewhere, and so\noften, been expressly granted,” id., at 467, citing a tradition\ndating back to Union Elec. Co. v. EPA, 427 U. S. 246, 257,\nand n. 5 (1976). There are, indeed, numerous Clean Air\nAct provisions explicitly permitting costs to be taken into\naccount. See, e.g., §7404(a)(1); §7521(a)(2); §7545(c)(2);\n§7547(a)(3); §7554(b)(2); §7571(b); §7651c(f)(1)(A). Ameri-\ncan Trucking thus demanded “a textual commitment of\nauthority to the EPA to consider costs,” 531 U. S., at 468—\na hurdle that the Good Neighbor Provision comes nowhere\nclose to clearing. Today’s opinion turns its back upon that\ncase and is incompatible with that opinion.3\n——————\n  3 The   majority shrugs off American Trucking in a footnote, reasoning\nthat because it characterized the provision there in question as “abso­\nlute,” it has nothing to say about the Good Neighbor Provision, which is\nnot absolute. See ante, at 28, n. 21. This is a textbook example of\nbegging the question: Since the Good Neighbor Provision is not absolute\n(the very point at issue here), American Trucking, which dealt with a\nprovision that is absolute, is irrelevant. To the contrary, American\nTrucking is right on point. As described in text, the provision at issue\n14         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L.

Circuit vacated the Transport Rule for the\nadditional reason that EPA took the reins in allocating\nemissions budgets among pollution-producing sources\nthrough Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) without\nfirst providing the States a meaningful opportunity to\nperform that task through State Implementation Plans\n(SIPs). The majority rejects that ruling on the ground\nthat “the Act does not require EPA to furnish upwind\nStates with information of any kind about their good\nneighbor obligations before a FIP issues.” Ante, at 16.\n“[N]othing in the statute,” the majority says, “places EPA\nunder an obligation to provide specific metrics to States\nbefore they undertake to fulfill their good neighbor obliga­\ntions.” Ante, at 17. This remarkably expansive reasoning\nmakes a hash of the Clean Air Act, transforming it from a\nprogram based on cooperative federalism to one of central­\nized federal control. Nothing in the Good Neighbor Provi­\nsion suggests such a stark departure from the Act’s fun­\ndamental structure.\n        A. Implications of State Regulatory Primacy\n   Down to its very core, the Clean Air Act sets forth a\nfederalism-focused regulatory strategy. The Act begins by\ndeclaring that “air pollution prevention (that is, the reduc­\ntion or elimination, through any measures, of the amount\nof pollutants produced or created at the source) and air\npollution control at its source is the primary responsibility\nof States and local governments.” §7401(a)(3) (emphasis\nadded). State primacy permeates Title I, which addresses\nthe promulgation and implementation of NAAQS, in par­\nticular. Under §7409(a), EPA must promulgate NAAQS\nfor each pollutant for which air-quality criteria have been\n—————— \n\nhere is even more categorical (“absolute”) than the provision at issue in\n\nAmerican Trucking. \n\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Section 7410(a)(1), in turn,\nrequires each State, usually within three years of each\nnew or revised NAAQS, to submit a SIP providing for its\n“implementation, maintenance, and enforcement.” EPA\nmay step in to take over that responsibility if, and only if,\na State discharges it inadequately. Specifically, if the\nAgency finds that a State has failed to make a required or\ncomplete submission or disapproves a SIP, it “shall prom­\nulgate a [FIP] at any time within 2 years . . . , unless the\nState corrects the deficiency, and [EPA] approves the [SIP]\nor [SIP] revision.” §7410(c)(1).\n   To describe the effect of this statutory scheme in simple\nterms: After EPA sets numerical air-quality benchmarks,\n“Congress plainly left with the States . . . the power to\ndetermine which sources would be burdened by regulation\nand to what extent.” Union Elec. Co., 427 U. S., at 269.\nThe States are to present their chosen means of achieving\nEPA’s benchmarks in SIPs, and only if a SIP fails to meet\nthose goals may the Agency commandeer a State’s author­\nity by promulgating a FIP. “[S]o long as the ultimate\neffect of a State’s choice of emission limitations is compli­\nance with the [NAAQS], the State is at liberty to adopt\nwhatever mix of emission limitations it deems best suited\nto its particular situation.” Train v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 421 U. S. 60, 79 (1975). EPA, we\nhave emphasized, “is relegated by the Act to a secondary\nrole in the process of determining and enforcing the spe-\ncific, source-by-source emission limitations which are\nnecessary if the [NAAQS] are to be met.” Ibid.\n   The Good Neighbor Provision is one of the requirements\nwith which SIPs must comply. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The\nstatutory structure described above plainly demands that\nEPA afford States a meaningful opportunity to allocate\nreduction responsibilities among the sources within their\nborders. But the majority holds that EPA may in effect\nforce the States to guess at what those responsibilities\n16        EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmight be by requiring them to submit SIPs before learning\nwhat the Agency regards as a “significan[t]” contribu­\ntion—with the consequence of losing their regulatory\nprimacy if they guess wrong. EPA asserts that the D. C.\nCircuit “was wrong as a factual matter” in reasoning that\nStates cannot feasibly implement the Good Neighbor\nProvision without knowing what the Agency considers\ntheir obligations to be. Brief for Federal Petitioners 29.\nThat is literally unbelievable. The only support that EPA\ncan muster are the assertions that “States routinely un­\ndertake technically complex air quality determinations”\nand that “emissions information from all States is publicly\navailable.” Ibid.

Past EPA Practice\n   EPA itself has long acknowledged the proposition that it\nis nonsensical to expect States to comply with the Good\nNeighbor Provision absent direction about what consti­\ntutes a “significan[t]” contribution to interstate pollution.\n   The Agency consistently adopted that position prior to\nthe Transport Rule. In 1998, when it issued the NOX SIP\nCall under §7410(k)(5), EPA acknowledged that “[w]ithout\ndetermining an acceptable level of NOX reductions, the\nupwind State would not have guidance as to what is an\nacceptable submission.” 63 Fed. Reg. 57370. EPA deemed\nit “most efficient—indeed necessary—for the Federal\ngovernment to establish the overall emissions levels for\nthe various States.” Ibid. Accordingly, the Agency quanti­\nfied good-neighbor responsibilities and then allowed\nStates a year to submit SIPs to implement them. Id., at\n57450–57451.\n   Similarly, when EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate\nRule (CAIR) in 2005 under §7410(c), it explicitly “recog­\nnize[d] that States would face great difficulties in develop­\ning transport SIPs to meet the requirements of today’s\naction without th[e] data and policies” provided by the\nRule, including “judgments from EPA concerning the\nappropriate criteria for determining whether upwind\nsources contribute significantly to downwind nonattain­\nment under [§74]10(a)(2)(D).” 70 id., at 25268–25269.\nThe Agency thus gave the States 18 months to submit\nSIPs implementing their new good-neighbor responsibili­\nties. See id., at 25166–25167, 25176. Although EPA\npublished FIPs before that window closed, it specified that\nthey were meant to serve only as a “Federal backstop” and\nwould not become effective unless necessary “a year after\nthe CAIR SIP submission deadline.” 71 id., at 25330–\n25331 (2006).\n18          EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                           SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   Even since promulgating the Transport Rule, EPA has\nrepeatedly reaffirmed that States cannot be expected to\nread the Agency’s mind. In other proceedings, EPA has\ntime and again stated that although “[s]ome of the ele­\nments of the [SIP-submission process] are relatively\nstraightforward, . . . others clearly require interpretation\nby EPA through rulemaking, or recommendations through\nguidance, in order to give specific meaning for a particular\nNAAQS.” 76 id., at 58751 (2011). As an example of the\nlatter, the Agency has remarked that the Good Neighbor\nProvision “contains numerous terms that require substan­\ntial rulemaking by EPA in order to determine such basic\npoints as what constitutes significant contribution,” citing\nCAIR. Ibid., n. 6. In fact, EPA repeated those precise\nstatements not once, not twice, but 30 times following\npromulgation of the Transport Rule.4\n   Notwithstanding what parties may have argued in other\nlitigation many years ago, it is beyond responsible debate\nthat the States cannot possibly design FIP-proof SIPs\nwithout knowing the EPA-prescribed targets at which\nthey must aim. EPA insists that it enjoys significant\ndiscretion—indeed, that it can consider essentially what­\never factors it wishes—to determine what constitutes a\n“significan[t]” contribution to interstate pollution; and it\nsimultaneously asserts that the States ought to know\nwhat quantities it will choose.

Abuse of Discretion\n   The majority attempts to place the blame for hollowing\nout the core of the Clean Air Act on “the Act’s plain text.”\nAnte, at 16. The first textual element to which it refers is\n§7410(c)’s requirement that after EPA has disapproved a\nSIP, it “shall promulgate a [FIP] at any time within 2\nyears.” That is to say, the Agency has discretion whether\nto act at once or to defer action until some later point\nduring the 2-year period. But it also has discretion to\nwork within the prescribed timetable to respect the right­\nful role of States in the statutory scheme by delaying the\nissuance or enforcement of FIPs pending the resubmission\nand approval of SIPs—as EPA’s conduct surrounding\nCAIR clearly demonstrates. And all of this assumes that\nthe Agency insists on disapproving SIPs before promulgat­\ning the applicable good-neighbor standards—though in\nfact EPA has discretion to publicize those metrics before\nthe window to submit SIPs closes in the first place.\n   The majority states that the Agency “retained discretion\nto alter its course” from the one pursued in the NOX SIP\nCall and CAIR, ante, at 17, but that misses the point.\nThe point is that EPA has discretion to arrange things so\nas to preserve the Clean Air Act’s core principle of state\nprimacy—and that it is an abuse of discretion to refuse to\ndo so. See §7607(d)(9)(A); see also 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A)\n(identical text in the Administrative Procedure Act).\nIndeed, the proviso in §7410(c)(1) that the Agency’s au­\nthority to promulgate a FIP within the 2-year period\nterminates if “the State corrects the deficiency, and [EPA]\napproves the [SIP] or [SIP] revision” explicitly contem­\nplates just such an arrangement.5\n——————\n   5 I am unimpressed, by the way, with the explanation that the major-\n\nity accepts for EPA’s about-face: that the D. C. Circuit admonished it to\n“act with dispatch in amending or replacing CAIR.” Ante, at 18 (citing\n20         EPA v. EME HOMER CITY GENERATION, L. P.\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   The majority’s conception of administrative discretion is\nso sprawling that it would allow EPA to subvert state\nprimacy not only with respect to the interstate-pollution\nconcerns of the Good Neighbor Provision, but with respect\nto the much broader concerns of the NAAQS program\nmore generally. States must submit SIPs “within 3 years”\nof each new or revised NAAQS “or such shorter period as\n[EPA] may prescribe.” §7410(a)(1) (emphasis added).\nBecause there is no principled reason to read that schedul­\ning provision in a less malleable manner than the one at\nissue here, under the majority’s view EPA could demand\nthat States submit SIPs within a matter of days—or even\nhours—after a NAAQS publication or else face the imme­\ndiate imposition of FIPs.\n   The second element of “plain text” on which the majority\nrelies is small beer indeed. The Good Neighbor Provision\ndoes not expressly state that EPA must publish target\nquantities before the States are required to submit SIPs—\neven though the Clean Air Act does so for NAAQS more\ngenerally and for vehicle inspection and maintenance\nprograms, see §7511a(c)(3)(B). From that premise, the\nmajority reasons that “[h]ad Congress intended similarly\nto defer States’ discharge of their obligations under the\nGood Neighbor Provision, Congress . . . would have included\na similar direction in that section.” Ante, at 17. Per­\nhaps so. But EPA itself read the statute differently when\nit declared in the NOX SIP Call that “[d]etermining the\noverall level of air pollutants allowed to be emitted in a\nState is comparable to determining [NAAQS], which the\ncourts have recognized as EPA’s responsibility, and is\n——————\nNorth Carolina v.

Reg. 57369 (emphasis added).\n   The negative implication suggested by a statute’s failure\nto use consistent terminology can be a helpful guide to\ndetermining meaning, especially when all the provisions\nin question were enacted at the same time (which is not\nthe case here). But because that interpretive canon, like\nothers, is just one clue to aid construction, it can be over­\ncome by more powerful indications of meaning elsewhere\nin the statute. It is, we have said, “no more than a rule of\nthumb that can tip the scales when a statute could be read\nin multiple ways.” Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical\nCenter, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9) (internal\nquotation marks and brackets omitted). The Clean Air\nAct simply cannot be read to make EPA the primary regu­\nlator in this context. The negative-implication canon is\neasily overcome by the statute’s state-respecting struc­\nture—not to mention the sheer impossibility of submitting\na sensible SIP without EPA guidance.
