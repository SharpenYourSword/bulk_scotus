JEFFREY WAYNE COTTON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 13–551.   Decided May 5, 2014\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   During the early morning hours of New Year’s Eve,\n2008, police sergeant Jeffrey Cotton fired three bullets at\nRobert Tolan; one of those bullets hit its target and punc-\ntured Tolan’s right lung. At the time of the shooting,\nTolan was unarmed on his parents’ front porch about 15 to\n20 feet away from Cotton. Tolan sued, alleging that Cot-\nton had exercised excessive force in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment. The District Court granted summary judg-\nment to Cotton, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, reasoning\nthat regardless of whether Cotton used excessive force, he\nwas entitled to qualified immunity because he did not\nviolate any clearly established right. 713 F. 3d 299 (2013).\nIn articulating the factual context of the case, the Fifth\nCircuit failed to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a\nmotion for summary judgment, “[t]he evidence of the\nnonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences\nare to be drawn in his favor.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U. S. 242, 255 (1986). For that reason, we vacate\nits decision and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The following facts, which we view in the light most\nfavorable to Tolan, are taken from the record evidence and\nthe opinions below. At around 2:00 on the morning of\nDecember 31, 2008, John Edwards, a police officer, was on\npatrol in Bellaire, Texas, when he noticed a black Nissan\n2                    TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nsport utility vehicle turning quickly onto a residential\nstreet. The officer watched the vehicle park on the side of\nthe street in front of a house. Two men exited: Tolan and\nhis cousin, Anthony Cooper.\n   Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number of\nthe vehicle into a computer in his squad car. But he keyed\nan incorrect character; instead of entering plate number\n696BGK, he entered 695BGK. That incorrect number\nmatched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make. This\nmatch caused the squad car’s computer to send an auto-\nmatic message to other police units, informing them that\nEdwards had found a stolen vehicle.\n   Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his service pistol and\nordered Tolan and Cooper to the ground. He accused\nTolan and Cooper of having stolen the car. Cooper re-\nsponded, “That’s not true.” Record 1295. And Tolan ex-\nplained, “That’s my car.” Ibid. Tolan then complied with\nthe officer’s demand to lie face-down on the home’s front\nporch.\n   As it turned out, Tolan and Cooper were at the home\nwhere Tolan lived with his parents. Hearing the commo-\ntion, Tolan’s parents exited the front door in their paja-\nmas. In an attempt to keep the misunderstanding from\nescalating into something more, Tolan’s father instructed\nCooper to lie down, and instructed Tolan and Cooper to\nsay nothing. Tolan and Cooper then remained facedown.\n   Edwards told Tolan’s parents that he believed Tolan and\nCooper had stolen the vehicle. In response, Tolan’s father\nidentified Tolan as his son, and Tolan’s mother explained\nthat the vehicle belonged to the family and that no crime\nhad been committed. Tolan’s father explained, with his\nhands in the air, “[T]his is my nephew. This is my son.\nWe live here. This is my house.” Id., at 2059. Tolan’s\nmother similarly offered, “[S]ir this is a big mistake. This\ncar is not stolen. . . . That’s our car.” Id., at 2075.\n   While Tolan and Cooper continued to lie on the ground\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nin silence, Edwards radioed for assistance. Shortly there-\nafter, Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton arrived on the scene and\ndrew his pistol. Edwards told Cotton that Cooper and\nTolan had exited a stolen vehicle. Tolan’s mother reiter-\nated that she and her husband owned both the car Tolan\nhad been driving and the home where these events were\nunfolding. Cotton then ordered her to stand against the\nfamily’s garage door. In response to Cotton’s order, To-\nlan’s mother asked, “[A]re you kidding me? We’ve lived\nher[e] 15 years. We’ve never had anything like this hap-\npen before.” Id., at 2077; see also id., at 1465.\n  The parties disagree as to what happened next. Tolan’s\nmother and Cooper testified during Cotton’s criminal trial1\nthat Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the\ngarage door with such force that she fell to the ground.\nId., at 2035, 2078–2080. Tolan similarly testified that\nCotton pushed his mother against the garage door. Id., at\n2479. In addition, Tolan offered testimony from his mother\nand photographic evidence to demonstrate that Cotton\nused enough force to leave bruises on her arms and back\nthat lasted for days. Id., at 2078–2079, 2089–2091. By\ncontrast, Cotton testified in his deposition that when he\nwas escorting the mother to the garage, she flipped her\narm up and told him to get his hands off her. Id., at 1043.\nHe also testified that he did not know whether he left\nbruises but believed that he had not. Id., at 1044.\n  The parties also dispute the manner in which Tolan\nresponded. Tolan testified in his deposition and during\nthe criminal trial that upon seeing his mother being\npushed, id., at 1249, he rose to his knees, id., at 1928.\nEdwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet.\n——————\n  1 The events described here led to Cotton’s criminal indictment in\n\nHarris County, Texas, for aggravated assault by a public servant. 713\nF. 3d 299, 303 (CA5 2013). He was acquitted. Ibid. The testimony of\nTolan’s mother during Cotton’s trial is a part of the record in this civil\naction. Record 2066–2087.\n4                        TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nId., at 1051–1052, 1121.\n  Both parties agree that Tolan then exclaimed, from\nroughly 15 to 20 feet away, 713 F. 3d, at 303, “[G]et your\nfucking hands off my mom.” Record 1928. The parties\nalso agree that Cotton then drew his pistol and fired three\nshots at Tolan. Tolan and his mother testified that these\nshots came with no verbal warning. Id., at 2019, 2080.\nOne of the bullets entered Tolan’s chest, collapsing his\nright lung and piercing his liver. While Tolan survived, he\nsuffered a life-altering injury that disrupted his budding\nprofessional baseball career and causes him to experience\npain on a daily basis.\n                             B\n  In May 2009, Cooper, Tolan, and Tolan’s parents filed\nthis suit in the Southern District of Texas, alleging claims\nunder Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Tolan claimed,\namong other things, that Cotton had used excessive force\nagainst him in violation of the Fourth Amendment.2 After\ndiscovery, Cotton moved for summary judgment, arguing\nthat the doctrine of qualified immunity barred the suit.\nThat doctrine immunizes government officials from dam-\nages suits unless their conduct has violated a clearly\nestablished right.\n  The District Court granted summary judgment to Cot-\nton. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (SD Tex. 2012). It reasoned that\nCotton’s use of force was not unreasonable and therefore\ndid not violate the Fourth Amendment. Id., at 477–478.\nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed, but on a different basis. 713\nF. 3d 299. It declined to decide whether Cotton’s actions\n——————\n   2 The complaint also alleged that the officers’ actions violated the\n\nEqual Protection Clause to the extent they were motivated by Tolan’s\nand Cooper’s race. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 465 (SD Tex. 2012). In addi-\ntion, the complaint alleged that Cotton used excessive force against\nTolan’s mother. Id., at 468. Those claims, which were dismissed, id., at\n465, 470, are not before this Court.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nviolated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, it held that\neven if Cotton’s conduct did violate the Fourth Amend-\nment, Cotton was entitled to qualified immunity because\nhe did not violate a clearly established right. Id., at 306.\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit began by\nnoting that at the time Cotton shot Tolan, “it was . . .\nclearly established that an officer had the right to use\ndeadly force if that officer harbored an objective and rea-\nsonable belief that a suspect presented an ‘immediate\nthreat to [his] safety.’ ” Id., at 306 (quoting Deville v.\nMarcantel, 567 F. 3d 156, 167 (CA5 2009)). The Court\nof Appeals reasoned that Tolan failed to overcome the\nqualified-immunity bar because “an objectively-reasonable\nofficer in Sergeant Cotton’s position could have . . . be-\nlieved” that Tolan “presented an ‘immediate threat to the\nsafety of the officers.’ ” 713 F. 3d, at 307.3 In support of\nthis conclusion, the court relied on the following facts: the\nfront porch had been “dimly-lit”; Tolan’s mother had “re-\nfus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm”; and Tolan’s\nwords had amounted to a “verba[l] threa[t].” Ibid. Most\ncritically, the court also relied on the purported fact that\nTolan was “moving to intervene in” Cotton’s handling of\nhis mother, id., at 305, and that Cotton therefore could\nreasonably have feared for his life, id., at 307. Accord-\ningly, the court held, Cotton did not violate clearly estab-\nlished law in shooting Tolan.\n   The Fifth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. 538 Fed.\nAppx. 374 (2013). Three judges voted to grant rehearing.\nJudge Dennis filed a dissent, contending that the panel\nopinion “fail[ed] to address evidence that, when viewed in\n——————\n  3 Tolan argues that the Fifth Circuit incorrectly analyzed the reason-\n\nableness of Sergeant Cotton’s beliefs under the second prong of the\nqualified-immunity analysis rather than the first. See Pet. for Cert. 12,\n20. Because we rule in Tolan’s favor on the narrow ground that the\nFifth Circuit erred in its application of the summary judgment stand-\nard, we express no view as to Tolan’s additional argument.\n6                    TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff, creates genuine\nissues of material fact as to whether an objective officer in\nCotton’s position could have reasonably and objectively\nbelieved that [Tolan] posed an immediate, significant\nthreat of substantial injury to him.” Id., at 377.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n   In resolving questions of qualified immunity at sum-\nmary judgment, courts engage in a two-pronged inquiry.\nThe first asks whether the facts, “[t]aken in the light most\nfavorable to the party asserting the injury, . . . show the\nofficer’s conduct violated a [federal] right[.]” Saucier v.\nKatz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). When a plaintiff alleges\nexcessive force during an investigation or arrest, the\nfederal right at issue is the Fourth Amendment right\nagainst unreasonable seizures. Graham v. Connor, 490\nU. S. 386, 394 (1989). The inquiry into whether this right\nwas violated requires a balancing of “ ‘the nature and\nquality of the intrusion on the individual’s Fourth\nAmendment interests against the importance of the gov-\nernmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.’ ”\nTennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1, 8 (1985); see Graham,\nsupra, at 396.\n   The second prong of the qualified-immunity analysis\nasks whether the right in question was “clearly estab-\nlished” at the time of the violation. Hope v. Pelzer, 536\nU. S. 730, 739 (2002). Governmental actors are “shielded\nfrom liability for civil damages if their actions did not\nviolate ‘clearly established statutory or constitutional\nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.’ ”\nIbid. “[T]he salient question . . . is whether the state of\nthe law” at the time of an incident provided “fair warning”\nto the defendants “that their alleged [conduct] was uncon-\nstitutional.” Id., at 741.\n    Courts have discretion to decide the order in which to\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nengage these two prongs. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S.\n223, 236 (2009). But under either prong, courts may not\nresolve genuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seek-\ning summary judgment. See Brosseau v. Haugen, 543\nU. S. 194, 195, n. 2 (2004) (per curiam); Saucier, supra, at\n201; Hope, supra, at 733, n. 1. This is not a rule specific to\nqualified immunity; it is simply an application of the more\ngeneral rule that a “judge’s function” at summary judg-\nment is not “to weigh the evidence and determine the\ntruth of the matter but to determine whether there is a\ngenuine issue for trial.” Anderson, 477 U. S., at 249.\nSummary judgment is appropriate only if “the movant\nshows that there is no genuine issue as to any material\nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a). In making that determi-\nnation, a court must view the evidence “in the light most\nfavorable to the opposing party.” Adickes v. S. H. Kress &\nCo., 398 U. S. 144, 157 (1970); see also Anderson, supra, at\n255.\n  Our qualified-immunity cases illustrate the importance\nof drawing inferences in favor of the nonmovant, even\nwhen, as here, a court decides only the clearly-established\nprong of the standard. In cases alleging unreasonable\nsearches or seizures, we have instructed that courts\nshould define the “clearly established” right at issue on\nthe basis of the “specific context of the case.” Saucier,\nsupra, at 201; see also Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S.\n635, 640–641 (1987). Accordingly, courts must take care\nnot to define a case’s “context” in a manner that imports\ngenuinely disputed factual propositions. See Brosseau,\nsupra, at 195, 198 (inquiring as to whether conduct violated\nclearly established law “ ‘in light of the specific context\nof the case’ ” and construing “facts . . . in a light most\nfavorable to” the nonmovant).\n8                     TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n                               B\n   In holding that Cotton’s actions did not violate clearly\nestablished law, the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evi-\ndence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to\nTolan with respect to the central facts of this case. By\nfailing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key\nfactual conclusions, the court improperly “weigh[ed] the\nevidence” and resolved disputed issues in favor of the\nmoving party, Anderson, 477 U. S., at 249.\n   First, the court relied on its view that at the time of the\nshooting, the Tolans’ front porch was “dimly-lit.” 713\nF. 3d, at 307. The court appears to have drawn this as-\nsessment from Cotton’s statements in a deposition that\nwhen he fired at Tolan, the porch was “ ‘fairly dark,’ ” and\nlit by a gas lamp that was “ ‘decorative.’ ” Id., at 302. In\nhis own deposition, however, Tolan’s father was asked\nwhether the gas lamp was in fact “more decorative than\nilluminating.” Record 1552. He said that it was not. Ibid.\nMoreover, Tolan stated in his deposition that two flood-\nlights shone on the driveway during the incident, id.,\nat 2496, and Cotton acknowledged that there were two\nmotion-activated lights in front of the house. Id., at 1034.\nAnd Tolan confirmed that at the time of the shooting, he\nwas “not in darkness.” Id., at 2498–2499.\n   Second, the Fifth Circuit stated that Tolan’s mother\n“refus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm,” thereby “com-\npound[ing]” Cotton’s belief that Tolan “presented an im-\nmediate threat to the safety of the officers.” 713 F. 3d, at\n307 (internal quotation marks omitted). But here, too, the\ncourt did not credit directly contradictory evidence. Al-\nthough the parties agree that Tolan’s mother repeatedly\ninformed officers that Tolan was her son, that she lived in\nthe home in front of which he had parked, and that the\nvehicle he had been driving belonged to her and her hus-\nband, there is a dispute as to how calmly she provided this\ninformation. Cotton stated during his deposition that\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nTolan’s mother was “very agitated” when she spoke to the\nofficers. Record 1032–1033. By contrast, Tolan’s mother\ntestified at Cotton’s criminal trial that she was neither\n“aggravated” nor “agitated.” Id., at 2075, 2077.\n  Third, the Court concluded that Tolan was “shouting,”\n713 F. 3d, at 306, 308, and “verbally threatening” the\nofficer, id., at 307, in the moments before the shooting.\nThe court noted, and the parties agree, that while Cotton\nwas grabbing the arm of his mother, Tolan told Cotton,\n“[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.” Record 1928. But\nTolan testified that he “was not screaming.” Id., at 2544.\nAnd a jury could reasonably infer that his words, in con-\ntext, did not amount to a statement of intent to inflict\nharm. Cf. United States v. White, 258 F. 3d 374, 383 (CA5\n2001) (“A threat imports ‘[a] communicated intent to\ninflict physical or other harm’ ” (quoting Black’s Law\nDictionary 1480 (6th ed. 1990))); Morris v. Noe, 672 F. 3d\n1185, 1196 (CA10 2012) (inferring that the words “Why\nwas you talking to Mama that way” did not constitute an\n“overt threa[t]”). Tolan’s mother testified in Cotton’s\ncriminal trial that he slammed her against a garage door\nwith enough force to cause bruising that lasted for days.\nRecord 2078–2079. A jury could well have concluded that\na reasonable officer would have heard Tolan’s words not as\na threat, but as a son’s plea not to continue any assault of\nhis mother.\n  Fourth, the Fifth Circuit inferred that at the time of the\nshooting, Tolan was “moving to intervene in Sergeant\nCotton’s” interaction with his mother. 713 F. 3d, at\n305; see also id., at 308 (characterizing Tolan’s behavior\nas “abruptly attempting to approach Sergeant Cotton,”\nthereby “inflam[ing] an already tense situation”). The\ncourt appears to have credited Edwards’ account that at\nthe time of the shooting, Tolan was on both feet “[i]n a\ncrouch” or a “charging position” looking as if he was going\nto move forward. Record 1121–1122. Tolan testified at\n10                   TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ntrial, however, that he was on his knees when Cotton shot\nhim, id., at 1928, a fact corroborated by his mother, id., at\n2081. Tolan also testified in his deposition that he “wasn’t\ngoing anywhere,” id., at 2502, and emphasized that he did\nnot “jump up,” id., at 2544.\n   Considered together, these facts lead to the inescapable\nconclusion that the court below credited the evidence of\nthe party seeking summary judgment and failed properly\nto acknowledge key evidence offered by the party opposing\nthat motion. And while “this Court is not equipped to\ncorrect every perceived error coming from the lower federal\ncourts,” Boag v. MacDougall 454 U. S. 364, 366 (1982)\n(O’Connor, J., concurring), we intervene here because the\nopinion below reflects a clear misapprehension of sum-\nmary judgment standards in light of our precedents. Cf.\nBrosseau, 543 U. S., at 197–198 (summarily reversing\ndecision in a Fourth Amendment excessive force case “to\ncorrect a clear misapprehension of the qualified immunity\nstandard”); see also Florida Dept. of Health and Rehabili-\ntative Servs. v. Florida Nursing Home Assn., 450 U. S.\n147, 150 (1981) (per curiam) (summarily reversing an\nopinion that could not “be reconciled with the principles\nset out” in this Court’s sovereign immunity jurisprudence).\n   The witnesses on both sides come to this case with their\nown perceptions, recollections, and even potential biases.\nIt is in part for that reason that genuine disputes are\ngenerally resolved by juries in our adversarial system. By\nweighing the evidence and reaching factual inferences\ncontrary to Tolan’s competent evidence, the court below\nneglected to adhere to the fundamental principle that at\nthe summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences\nshould be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.\n   Applying that principle here, the court should have\nacknowledged and credited Tolan’s evidence with regard\nto the lighting, his mother’s demeanor, whether he shouted\nwords that were an overt threat, and his positioning\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

This is not to say, of course, that\nthese are the only facts that the Fifth Circuit should con-\nsider, or that no other facts might contribute to the rea-\nsonableness of the officer’s actions as a matter of law. Nor\ndo we express a view as to whether Cotton’s actions vio-\nlated clearly established law. We instead vacate the Fifth\nCircuit’s judgment so that the court can determine whether,\nwhen Tolan’s evidence is properly credited and factual\ninferences are reasonably drawn in his favor, Cotton’s\nactions violated clearly established law.\n                        *   *    *\n  The petition for certiorari and the NAACP Legal De-\nfense and Educational Fund’s motion to file an amicus\ncuriae brief are granted.

Hartnett, & D.\nHimmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice §5.12(c)(3), p. 352\n(10th ed. 2013) (“[E]rror correction . . . is outside the\nmainstream of the Court’s functions and . . . not among\nthe ‘compelling reasons’ . . . that govern the grant of\ncertiorari”).\n   In my experience, a substantial percentage of the civil\nappeals heard each year by the courts of appeals present\nthe question whether the evidence in the summary judg-\nment record is just enough or not quite enough to support\na grant of summary judgment. The present case falls into\nthat very large category. There is no confusion in the\ncourts of appeals about the standard to be applied in\nruling on a summary judgment motion, and the Court of\nAppeals invoked the correct standard here. See 713 F. 3d\n2                     TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n299, 304 (CA5 2013). Thus, the only issue is whether the\nrelevant evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to\nthe nonmoving party, is sufficient to support a judgment\nfor that party. In the courts of appeals, cases presenting\nthis question are utterly routine. There is no question\nthat this case is important for the parties, but the same is\ntrue for a great many other cases that fall into the same\ncategory.\n  On the merits of the case, while I do not necessarily\nagree in all respects with the Court’s characterization of\nthe evidence, I agree that there are genuine issues of\nmaterial fact and that this is a case in which summary\njudgment should not have been granted.\n  I therefore concur in the judgment.\n</pre>", "id": 2672535, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/05/05/tolan_v._cotton.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 572 U.

JEFFREY WAYNE COTTON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 13–551.   Decided May 5, 2014\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   During the early morning hours of New Year’s Eve,\n2008, police sergeant Jeffrey Cotton fired three bullets at\nRobert Tolan; one of those bullets hit its target and punc-\ntured Tolan’s right lung. At the time of the shooting,\nTolan was unarmed on his parents’ front porch about 15 to\n20 feet away from Cotton. Tolan sued, alleging that Cot-\nton had exercised excessive force in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment. The District Court granted summary judg-\nment to Cotton, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, reasoning\nthat regardless of whether Cotton used excessive force, he\nwas entitled to qualified immunity because he did not\nviolate any clearly established right. 713 F. 3d 299 (2013).\nIn articulating the factual context of the case, the Fifth\nCircuit failed to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a\nmotion for summary judgment, “[t]he evidence of the\nnonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences\nare to be drawn in his favor.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U. S. 242, 255 (1986). For that reason, we vacate\nits decision and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The following facts, which we view in the light most\nfavorable to Tolan, are taken from the record evidence and\nthe opinions below. At around 2:00 on the morning of\nDecember 31, 2008, John Edwards, a police officer, was on\npatrol in Bellaire, Texas, when he noticed a black Nissan\n2                    TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nsport utility vehicle turning quickly onto a residential\nstreet. The officer watched the vehicle park on the side of\nthe street in front of a house. Two men exited: Tolan and\nhis cousin, Anthony Cooper.\n   Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number of\nthe vehicle into a computer in his squad car. But he keyed\nan incorrect character; instead of entering plate number\n696BGK, he entered 695BGK. That incorrect number\nmatched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make. This\nmatch caused the squad car’s computer to send an auto-\nmatic message to other police units, informing them that\nEdwards had found a stolen vehicle.\n   Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his service pistol and\nordered Tolan and Cooper to the ground. He accused\nTolan and Cooper of having stolen the car. Cooper re-\nsponded, “That’s not true.” Record 1295. And Tolan ex-\nplained, “That’s my car.” Ibid. Tolan then complied with\nthe officer’s demand to lie face-down on the home’s front\nporch.\n   As it turned out, Tolan and Cooper were at the home\nwhere Tolan lived with his parents. Hearing the commo-\ntion, Tolan’s parents exited the front door in their paja-\nmas. In an attempt to keep the misunderstanding from\nescalating into something more, Tolan’s father instructed\nCooper to lie down, and instructed Tolan and Cooper to\nsay nothing. Tolan and Cooper then remained facedown.\n   Edwards told Tolan’s parents that he believed Tolan and\nCooper had stolen the vehicle. In response, Tolan’s father\nidentified Tolan as his son, and Tolan’s mother explained\nthat the vehicle belonged to the family and that no crime\nhad been committed. Tolan’s father explained, with his\nhands in the air, “[T]his is my nephew. This is my son.\nWe live here. This is my house.” Id., at 2059. Tolan’s\nmother similarly offered, “[S]ir this is a big mistake. This\ncar is not stolen. . . . That’s our car.” Id., at 2075.\n   While Tolan and Cooper continued to lie on the ground\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nin silence, Edwards radioed for assistance. Shortly there-\nafter, Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton arrived on the scene and\ndrew his pistol. Edwards told Cotton that Cooper and\nTolan had exited a stolen vehicle. Tolan’s mother reiter-\nated that she and her husband owned both the car Tolan\nhad been driving and the home where these events were\nunfolding. Cotton then ordered her to stand against the\nfamily’s garage door. In response to Cotton’s order, To-\nlan’s mother asked, “[A]re you kidding me? We’ve lived\nher[e] 15 years. We’ve never had anything like this hap-\npen before.” Id., at 2077; see also id., at 1465.\n  The parties disagree as to what happened next. Tolan’s\nmother and Cooper testified during Cotton’s criminal trial1\nthat Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the\ngarage door with such force that she fell to the ground.\nId., at 2035, 2078–2080. Tolan similarly testified that\nCotton pushed his mother against the garage door. Id., at\n2479. In addition, Tolan offered testimony from his mother\nand photographic evidence to demonstrate that Cotton\nused enough force to leave bruises on her arms and back\nthat lasted for days. Id., at 2078–2079, 2089–2091. By\ncontrast, Cotton testified in his deposition that when he\nwas escorting the mother to the garage, she flipped her\narm up and told him to get his hands off her. Id., at 1043.\nHe also testified that he did not know whether he left\nbruises but believed that he had not. Id., at 1044.\n  The parties also dispute the manner in which Tolan\nresponded. Tolan testified in his deposition and during\nthe criminal trial that upon seeing his mother being\npushed, id., at 1249, he rose to his knees, id., at 1928.\nEdwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet.\n——————\n  1 The events described here led to Cotton’s criminal indictment in\n\nHarris County, Texas, for aggravated assault by a public servant. 713\nF. 3d 299, 303 (CA5 2013). He was acquitted. Ibid. The testimony of\nTolan’s mother during Cotton’s trial is a part of the record in this civil\naction. Record 2066–2087.\n4                        TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nId., at 1051–1052, 1121.\n  Both parties agree that Tolan then exclaimed, from\nroughly 15 to 20 feet away, 713 F. 3d, at 303, “[G]et your\nfucking hands off my mom.” Record 1928. The parties\nalso agree that Cotton then drew his pistol and fired three\nshots at Tolan. Tolan and his mother testified that these\nshots came with no verbal warning. Id., at 2019, 2080.\nOne of the bullets entered Tolan’s chest, collapsing his\nright lung and piercing his liver. While Tolan survived, he\nsuffered a life-altering injury that disrupted his budding\nprofessional baseball career and causes him to experience\npain on a daily basis.\n                             B\n  In May 2009, Cooper, Tolan, and Tolan’s parents filed\nthis suit in the Southern District of Texas, alleging claims\nunder Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Tolan claimed,\namong other things, that Cotton had used excessive force\nagainst him in violation of the Fourth Amendment.2 After\ndiscovery, Cotton moved for summary judgment, arguing\nthat the doctrine of qualified immunity barred the suit.\nThat doctrine immunizes government officials from dam-\nages suits unless their conduct has violated a clearly\nestablished right.\n  The District Court granted summary judgment to Cot-\nton. 854 F. Supp. 2d 444 (SD Tex. 2012). It reasoned that\nCotton’s use of force was not unreasonable and therefore\ndid not violate the Fourth Amendment. Id., at 477–478.\nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed, but on a different basis. 713\nF. 3d 299. It declined to decide whether Cotton’s actions\n——————\n   2 The complaint also alleged that the officers’ actions violated the\n\nEqual Protection Clause to the extent they were motivated by Tolan’s\nand Cooper’s race. 854 F. Supp. 2d 444, 465 (SD Tex. 2012). In addi-\ntion, the complaint alleged that Cotton used excessive force against\nTolan’s mother. Id., at 468. Those claims, which were dismissed, id., at\n465, 470, are not before this Court.\n                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nviolated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, it held that\neven if Cotton’s conduct did violate the Fourth Amend-\nment, Cotton was entitled to qualified immunity because\nhe did not violate a clearly established right. Id., at 306.\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit began by\nnoting that at the time Cotton shot Tolan, “it was . . .\nclearly established that an officer had the right to use\ndeadly force if that officer harbored an objective and rea-\nsonable belief that a suspect presented an ‘immediate\nthreat to [his] safety.’ ” Id., at 306 (quoting Deville v.\nMarcantel, 567 F. 3d 156, 167 (CA5 2009)). The Court\nof Appeals reasoned that Tolan failed to overcome the\nqualified-immunity bar because “an objectively-reasonable\nofficer in Sergeant Cotton’s position could have . . . be-\nlieved” that Tolan “presented an ‘immediate threat to the\nsafety of the officers.’ ” 713 F. 3d, at 307.3 In support of\nthis conclusion, the court relied on the following facts: the\nfront porch had been “dimly-lit”; Tolan’s mother had “re-\nfus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm”; and Tolan’s\nwords had amounted to a “verba[l] threa[t].” Ibid. Most\ncritically, the court also relied on the purported fact that\nTolan was “moving to intervene in” Cotton’s handling of\nhis mother, id., at 305, and that Cotton therefore could\nreasonably have feared for his life, id., at 307. Accord-\ningly, the court held, Cotton did not violate clearly estab-\nlished law in shooting Tolan.\n   The Fifth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. 538 Fed.\nAppx. 374 (2013). Three judges voted to grant rehearing.\nJudge Dennis filed a dissent, contending that the panel\nopinion “fail[ed] to address evidence that, when viewed in\n——————\n  3 Tolan argues that the Fifth Circuit incorrectly analyzed the reason-\n\nableness of Sergeant Cotton’s beliefs under the second prong of the\nqualified-immunity analysis rather than the first. See Pet. for Cert. 12,\n20. Because we rule in Tolan’s favor on the narrow ground that the\nFifth Circuit erred in its application of the summary judgment stand-\nard, we express no view as to Tolan’s additional argument.\n6                    TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff, creates genuine\nissues of material fact as to whether an objective officer in\nCotton’s position could have reasonably and objectively\nbelieved that [Tolan] posed an immediate, significant\nthreat of substantial injury to him.” Id., at 377.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n   In resolving questions of qualified immunity at sum-\nmary judgment, courts engage in a two-pronged inquiry.\nThe first asks whether the facts, “[t]aken in the light most\nfavorable to the party asserting the injury, . . . show the\nofficer’s conduct violated a [federal] right[.]” Saucier v.\nKatz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). When a plaintiff alleges\nexcessive force during an investigation or arrest, the\nfederal right at issue is the Fourth Amendment right\nagainst unreasonable seizures. Graham v. Connor, 490\nU. S. 386, 394 (1989). The inquiry into whether this right\nwas violated requires a balancing of “ ‘the nature and\nquality of the intrusion on the individual’s Fourth\nAmendment interests against the importance of the gov-\nernmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.’ ”\nTennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1, 8 (1985); see Graham,\nsupra, at 396.\n   The second prong of the qualified-immunity analysis\nasks whether the right in question was “clearly estab-\nlished” at the time of the violation. Hope v. Pelzer, 536\nU. S. 730, 739 (2002). Governmental actors are “shielded\nfrom liability for civil damages if their actions did not\nviolate ‘clearly established statutory or constitutional\nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.’ ”\nIbid. “[T]he salient question . . . is whether the state of\nthe law” at the time of an incident provided “fair warning”\nto the defendants “that their alleged [conduct] was uncon-\nstitutional.” Id., at 741.\n    Courts have discretion to decide the order in which to\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nengage these two prongs. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S.\n223, 236 (2009). But under either prong, courts may not\nresolve genuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seek-\ning summary judgment. See Brosseau v. Haugen, 543\nU. S. 194, 195, n. 2 (2004) (per curiam); Saucier, supra, at\n201; Hope, supra, at 733, n. 1. This is not a rule specific to\nqualified immunity; it is simply an application of the more\ngeneral rule that a “judge’s function” at summary judg-\nment is not “to weigh the evidence and determine the\ntruth of the matter but to determine whether there is a\ngenuine issue for trial.” Anderson, 477 U. S., at 249.\nSummary judgment is appropriate only if “the movant\nshows that there is no genuine issue as to any material\nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a). In making that determi-\nnation, a court must view the evidence “in the light most\nfavorable to the opposing party.” Adickes v. S. H. Kress &\nCo., 398 U. S. 144, 157 (1970); see also Anderson, supra, at\n255.\n  Our qualified-immunity cases illustrate the importance\nof drawing inferences in favor of the nonmovant, even\nwhen, as here, a court decides only the clearly-established\nprong of the standard. In cases alleging unreasonable\nsearches or seizures, we have instructed that courts\nshould define the “clearly established” right at issue on\nthe basis of the “specific context of the case.” Saucier,\nsupra, at 201; see also Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S.\n635, 640–641 (1987). Accordingly, courts must take care\nnot to define a case’s “context” in a manner that imports\ngenuinely disputed factual propositions. See Brosseau,\nsupra, at 195, 198 (inquiring as to whether conduct violated\nclearly established law “ ‘in light of the specific context\nof the case’ ” and construing “facts . . . in a light most\nfavorable to” the nonmovant).\n8                     TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n                               B\n   In holding that Cotton’s actions did not violate clearly\nestablished law, the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evi-\ndence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to\nTolan with respect to the central facts of this case. By\nfailing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key\nfactual conclusions, the court improperly “weigh[ed] the\nevidence” and resolved disputed issues in favor of the\nmoving party, Anderson, 477 U. S., at 249.\n   First, the court relied on its view that at the time of the\nshooting, the Tolans’ front porch was “dimly-lit.” 713\nF. 3d, at 307. The court appears to have drawn this as-\nsessment from Cotton’s statements in a deposition that\nwhen he fired at Tolan, the porch was “ ‘fairly dark,’ ” and\nlit by a gas lamp that was “ ‘decorative.’ ” Id., at 302. In\nhis own deposition, however, Tolan’s father was asked\nwhether the gas lamp was in fact “more decorative than\nilluminating.” Record 1552. He said that it was not. Ibid.\nMoreover, Tolan stated in his deposition that two flood-\nlights shone on the driveway during the incident, id.,\nat 2496, and Cotton acknowledged that there were two\nmotion-activated lights in front of the house. Id., at 1034.\nAnd Tolan confirmed that at the time of the shooting, he\nwas “not in darkness.” Id., at 2498–2499.\n   Second, the Fifth Circuit stated that Tolan’s mother\n“refus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm,” thereby “com-\npound[ing]” Cotton’s belief that Tolan “presented an im-\nmediate threat to the safety of the officers.” 713 F. 3d, at\n307 (internal quotation marks omitted). But here, too, the\ncourt did not credit directly contradictory evidence. Al-\nthough the parties agree that Tolan’s mother repeatedly\ninformed officers that Tolan was her son, that she lived in\nthe home in front of which he had parked, and that the\nvehicle he had been driving belonged to her and her hus-\nband, there is a dispute as to how calmly she provided this\ninformation. Cotton stated during his deposition that\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nTolan’s mother was “very agitated” when she spoke to the\nofficers. Record 1032–1033. By contrast, Tolan’s mother\ntestified at Cotton’s criminal trial that she was neither\n“aggravated” nor “agitated.” Id., at 2075, 2077.\n  Third, the Court concluded that Tolan was “shouting,”\n713 F. 3d, at 306, 308, and “verbally threatening” the\nofficer, id., at 307, in the moments before the shooting.\nThe court noted, and the parties agree, that while Cotton\nwas grabbing the arm of his mother, Tolan told Cotton,\n“[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.” Record 1928. But\nTolan testified that he “was not screaming.” Id., at 2544.\nAnd a jury could reasonably infer that his words, in con-\ntext, did not amount to a statement of intent to inflict\nharm. Cf. United States v. White, 258 F. 3d 374, 383 (CA5\n2001) (“A threat imports ‘[a] communicated intent to\ninflict physical or other harm’ ” (quoting Black’s Law\nDictionary 1480 (6th ed. 1990))); Morris v. Noe, 672 F. 3d\n1185, 1196 (CA10 2012) (inferring that the words “Why\nwas you talking to Mama that way” did not constitute an\n“overt threa[t]”). Tolan’s mother testified in Cotton’s\ncriminal trial that he slammed her against a garage door\nwith enough force to cause bruising that lasted for days.\nRecord 2078–2079. A jury could well have concluded that\na reasonable officer would have heard Tolan’s words not as\na threat, but as a son’s plea not to continue any assault of\nhis mother.\n  Fourth, the Fifth Circuit inferred that at the time of the\nshooting, Tolan was “moving to intervene in Sergeant\nCotton’s” interaction with his mother. 713 F. 3d, at\n305; see also id., at 308 (characterizing Tolan’s behavior\nas “abruptly attempting to approach Sergeant Cotton,”\nthereby “inflam[ing] an already tense situation”). The\ncourt appears to have credited Edwards’ account that at\nthe time of the shooting, Tolan was on both feet “[i]n a\ncrouch” or a “charging position” looking as if he was going\nto move forward. Record 1121–1122. Tolan testified at\n10                   TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ntrial, however, that he was on his knees when Cotton shot\nhim, id., at 1928, a fact corroborated by his mother, id., at\n2081. Tolan also testified in his deposition that he “wasn’t\ngoing anywhere,” id., at 2502, and emphasized that he did\nnot “jump up,” id., at 2544.\n   Considered together, these facts lead to the inescapable\nconclusion that the court below credited the evidence of\nthe party seeking summary judgment and failed properly\nto acknowledge key evidence offered by the party opposing\nthat motion. And while “this Court is not equipped to\ncorrect every perceived error coming from the lower federal\ncourts,” Boag v. MacDougall 454 U. S. 364, 366 (1982)\n(O’Connor, J., concurring), we intervene here because the\nopinion below reflects a clear misapprehension of sum-\nmary judgment standards in light of our precedents. Cf.\nBrosseau, 543 U. S., at 197–198 (summarily reversing\ndecision in a Fourth Amendment excessive force case “to\ncorrect a clear misapprehension of the qualified immunity\nstandard”); see also Florida Dept. of Health and Rehabili-\ntative Servs. v. Florida Nursing Home Assn., 450 U. S.\n147, 150 (1981) (per curiam) (summarily reversing an\nopinion that could not “be reconciled with the principles\nset out” in this Court’s sovereign immunity jurisprudence).\n   The witnesses on both sides come to this case with their\nown perceptions, recollections, and even potential biases.\nIt is in part for that reason that genuine disputes are\ngenerally resolved by juries in our adversarial system. By\nweighing the evidence and reaching factual inferences\ncontrary to Tolan’s competent evidence, the court below\nneglected to adhere to the fundamental principle that at\nthe summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences\nshould be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.\n   Applying that principle here, the court should have\nacknowledged and credited Tolan’s evidence with regard\nto the lighting, his mother’s demeanor, whether he shouted\nwords that were an overt threat, and his positioning\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

This is not to say, of course, that\nthese are the only facts that the Fifth Circuit should con-\nsider, or that no other facts might contribute to the rea-\nsonableness of the officer’s actions as a matter of law. Nor\ndo we express a view as to whether Cotton’s actions vio-\nlated clearly established law. We instead vacate the Fifth\nCircuit’s judgment so that the court can determine whether,\nwhen Tolan’s evidence is properly credited and factual\ninferences are reasonably drawn in his favor, Cotton’s\nactions violated clearly established law.\n                        *   *    *\n  The petition for certiorari and the NAACP Legal De-\nfense and Educational Fund’s motion to file an amicus\ncuriae brief are granted.

Hartnett, & D.\nHimmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice §5.12(c)(3), p. 352\n(10th ed. 2013) (“[E]rror correction . . . is outside the\nmainstream of the Court’s functions and . . . not among\nthe ‘compelling reasons’ . . . that govern the grant of\ncertiorari”).\n   In my experience, a substantial percentage of the civil\nappeals heard each year by the courts of appeals present\nthe question whether the evidence in the summary judg-\nment record is just enough or not quite enough to support\na grant of summary judgment. The present case falls into\nthat very large category. There is no confusion in the\ncourts of appeals about the standard to be applied in\nruling on a summary judgment motion, and the Court of\nAppeals invoked the correct standard here. See 713 F. 3d\n2                     TOLAN v. COTTON\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n299, 304 (CA5 2013). Thus, the only issue is whether the\nrelevant evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to\nthe nonmoving party, is sufficient to support a judgment\nfor that party. In the courts of appeals, cases presenting\nthis question are utterly routine. There is no question\nthat this case is important for the parties, but the same is\ntrue for a great many other cases that fall into the same\ncategory.\n  On the merits of the case, while I do not necessarily\nagree in all respects with the Court’s characterization of\nthe evidence, I agree that there are genuine issues of\nmaterial fact and that this is a case in which summary\njudgment should not have been granted.\n  I therefore concur in the judgment.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2672535/", "sha1": "84de5f6fa6911001a2df82d340d9fa65a7019cd3", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-044", "time_retrieved": "2014-05-05T07:46:12.070762"}
