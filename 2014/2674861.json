METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC., ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12–1315. Argued January 21, 2014—Decided May 19, 2014\nThe Copyright Act (Act) protects copyrighted works published before\n  1978 for an initial period of 28 years, renewable for a period of up to\n  67 years. 17 U. S. C. §304(a). The author’s heirs inherit the renewal\n  rights. See §304(a)(1)(C)(ii)–(iv). When an author who has assigned\n  her rights away “dies before the renewal period, . . . the assignee may\n  continue to use the original work only if the author’s successor trans-\n  fers the renewal rights to the assignee,” Stewart v. Abend, 495 U. S.\n  207, 221. The Act provides both equitable and legal remedies for in-\n  fringement: an injunction “on such terms as [a court] may deem rea-\n  sonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright,” §502(a);\n  and, at the copyright owner’s election, either (1) the “owner’s actual\n  damages and any additional profits of the infringer,” §504(a)(1),\n  which petitioner seeks in this case, or (2) specified statutory damag-\n  es, §504(c). The Act’s statute of limitations provides: “No civil action\n  shall be maintained under the [Act] unless it is commenced within\n  three years after the claim accrued.” §507(b). A claim ordinarily ac-\n  crues when an infringing act occurs. Under the separate-accrual rule\n  that attends the copyright statute of limitations, when a defendant\n  has committed successive violations, each infringing act starts a new\n  limitations period. However, under §507(b), each infringement is ac-\n  tionable only within three years of its occurrence.\n     Here, the allegedly infringing work is the motion picture Raging\n  Bull, based on the life of boxing champion Jake LaMotta, who, with\n  Frank Petrella, told his story in, inter alia, a screenplay copyrighted\n  in 1963. In 1976, the pair assigned their rights and renewal rights,\n  which were later acquired by respondent United Artists Corporation,\n  a subsidiary of respondent Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (collectively,\n  MGM). In 1980, MGM released, and registered a copyright in, the\n2           PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    film Raging Bull, and it continues to market the film today. Frank\n    Petrella died during the initial copyright term, so renewal rights re-\n    verted to his heirs. Plaintiff below, petitioner here, Paula Petrella\n    (Petrella), his daughter, renewed the 1963 copyright in 1991, becom-\n    ing its sole owner. Seven years later, she advised MGM that its ex-\n    ploitation of Raging Bull violated her copyright and threatened suit.\n    Some nine years later, on January 6, 2009, she filed an infringement\n    suit, seeking monetary and injunctive relief limited to acts of in-\n    fringement occurring on or after January 6, 2006. Invoking the equi-\n    table doctrine of laches, MGM moved for summary judgment. Pet-\n    rella’s 18-year delay in filing suit, MGM argued, was unreasonable\n    and prejudicial to MGM. The District Court granted MGM’s motion,\n    holding that laches barred Petrella’s complaint. The Ninth Circuit\n    affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Laches cannot be invoked as a bar to Petrella’s pursuit of a claim\n for damages brought within §507(b)’s three-year window. Pp. 11–19.\n       (a) By permitting a successful plaintiff to gain retrospective relief\n only three years back from the time of suit, the copyright statute of\n limitations itself takes account of delay. Brought to bear here,\n §507(b) directs that Petrella cannot reach MGM’s returns on its in-\n vestment in Raging Bull in years before 2006. Moreover, if infringe-\n ment within the three-year window is shown, a defendant may offset\n against profits made in that period expenses incurred in generating\n those profits. See §504(b). In addition, a defendant may retain the\n return on investment shown to be attributable to its own enterprise,\n as distinct from the value created by the infringed work. See ibid.\n Both before and after the merger of law and equity in 1938, this\n Court has cautioned against invoking laches to bar legal relief. See,\n e.g., Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 395, 396. Pp. 11–14.\n       (b) MGM’s principal arguments regarding the contemporary\n scope of the laches defense are unavailing. Pp. 14–19.\n         (1) MGM urges that, because laches is listed in Federal Rule of\n Civil Procedure 8(c) as an affirmative defense discrete from a statute\n of limitations defense, the plea should be “available . . . in every civil\n action” to bar all forms of relief. Such an expansive role careens\n away from understandings, past and present, of the essentially gap-\n filling, not legislation-overriding, office of laches. This Court has\n never applied laches to bar in their entirety claims for discrete\n wrongs occurring within a federally prescribed limitations period.\n Inviting individual judges to set a time limit other than the one Con-\n gress prescribed would tug against the uniformity Congress sought to\n achieve in enacting §507(b). Pp. 14–15.\n         (2) MGM contends that laches, like equitable tolling, should be\n                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n“read into every federal statute of limitation,” Holmberg, 327 U. S., at\n397. However, tolling lengthens the time for commencing a civil ac-\ntion where there is a statute of limitations and is, in effect, a rule of\ninterpretation tied to that statutory limit. See, e.g., Young v. United\nStates, 535 U. S. 43, 49–50. In contrast, laches, which originally\nserved as a guide when no statute of limitations controlled, can\nscarcely be described as a rule for interpreting a statutory prescrip-\ntion. Pp. 15–16.\n       (3) MGM insists that the laches defense must be available to\nprevent a copyright owner from sitting still, doing nothing, waiting to\nsee what the outcome of an alleged infringer’s investment will be. It\nis hardly incumbent on copyright owners, however, to challenge each\nand every actionable infringement. And there is nothing untoward\nabout waiting to see whether an infringer’s exploitation undercuts\nthe value of the copyrighted work, has no effect on that work, or even\ncomplements it. Section 507(b)’s limitations period, coupled to the\nseparate-accrual rule, allows a copyright owner to defer suit until she\ncan estimate whether litigation is worth the candle. Pp. 16–17.\n       (4) MGM is concerned that evidence needed or useful to defend\nagainst liability will be lost during a copyright owner’s inaction. But\nCongress must have been aware that the passage of time and the au-\nthor’s death could cause evidentiary issues when it provided for re-\nversionary renewal rights that an author’s heirs can exercise long af-\nter a work was written and copyrighted. Moreover, because a\ncopyright plaintiff bears the burden of proving infringement, any\nhindrance caused by evidence unavailability is as likely to affect\nplaintiffs as defendants. The need for extrinsic evidence is also re-\nduced by the registration mechanism, under which both the certifi-\ncate and the original work must be on file with the Copyright Office\nbefore a copyright owner can sue for infringement. Pp. 17–18.\n       (5) Finally, when a copyright owner engages in intentionally\nmisleading representations concerning his abstention from suit, and\nthe alleged infringer detrimentally relies on such deception, the doc-\ntrine of estoppel may bar the copyright owner’s claims completely,\neliminating all potential remedies. The gravamen of estoppel, a de-\nfense long recognized as available in actions at law, is wrongdoing,\novert misleading, and consequent loss. Estoppel does not undermine\nthe statute of limitations, for it rests on misleading, whether engaged\nin early on, or later in time. P. 19.\n   2. While laches cannot be invoked to preclude adjudication of a\nclaim for damages brought within the Act’s three-year window, in ex-\ntraordinary circumstances, laches may, at the very outset of the liti-\ngation, curtail the relief equitably awarded. For example, where\nowners of a copyrighted architectural design, although aware of an\n4           PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    allegedly infringing housing project, delayed suit until the project\n    was substantially constructed and partially occupied, an order man-\n    dating destruction of the project would not be tolerable. See Chirco v.\n    Crosswinds Communities, Inc., 474 F. 3d 227, 236. Nor, in the face of\n    an unexplained delay in commencing suit, would it be equitable to\n    order “total destruction” of a book already printed, packed, and\n    shipped. See New Era Publications Int’l v. Henry Holt & Co., 873\n    F. 2d 576, 584–585. No such extraordinary circumstance is present\n    here. Petrella notified MGM of her copyright claims before MGM in-\n    vested millions of dollars in creating a new edition of Raging Bull,\n    and the equitable relief she seeks—e.g., disgorgement of unjust gains\n    and an injunction against future infringement—would not result in\n    anything like “total destruction” of the film. Allowing Petrella’s suit\n    to go forward will put at risk only a fraction of the income MGM has\n    earned during the more than three decades Raging Bull has been\n    marketed and will work no unjust hardship on innocent third parties.\n    Should Petrella ultimately prevail on the merits, the District Court,\n    in determining appropriate injunctive relief and assessing profits,\n    may take account of Petrella’s delay in commencing suit. In doing so,\n    however, the court must closely examine MGM’s alleged reliance on\n    Petrella’s delay, taking account of MGM’s early knowledge of her\n    claims, the protection MGM might have achieved through a declara-\n    tory judgment action, the extent to which MGM’s investment was\n    protected by the separate-accrual rule, the court’s authority to order\n    injunctive relief “on such terms as it may deem reasonable,” §502(a),\n    and any other relevant considerations.

S. C.\n§507(b). This case presents the question whether the\nequitable defense of laches (unreasonable, prejudicial\ndelay in commencing suit) may bar relief on a copyright\ninfringement claim brought within §507(b)’s three-year\nlimitations period. Section 507(b), it is undisputed, bars\nrelief of any kind for conduct occurring prior to the three-\nyear limitations period. To the extent that an infringe-\nment suit seeks relief solely for conduct occurring within\nthe limitations period, however, courts are not at liberty to\njettison Congress’ judgment on the timeliness of suit.\nLaches, we hold, cannot be invoked to preclude adjudica-\ntion of a claim for damages brought within the three-year\nwindow. As to equitable relief, in extraordinary circum-\nstances, laches may bar at the very threshold the particu-\nlar relief requested by the plaintiff. And a plaintiff ’s delay\ncan always be brought to bear at the remedial stage, in\ndetermining appropriate injunctive relief, and in assessing\n2          PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe “profits of the infringer . . . attributable to the in-\nfringement.” §504(b).1\n   Petitioner Paula Petrella, in her suit for copyright in-\nfringement, sought no relief for conduct occurring outside\n§507(b)’s three-year limitations period. Nevertheless, the\ncourts below held that laches barred her suit in its en-\ntirety, without regard to the currency of the conduct of\nwhich Petrella complains. That position, we hold, is con-\ntrary to §507(b) and this Court’s precedent on the province\nof laches.\n                              I\n  The Copyright Act (Act), 17 U. S. C. §101 et seq., grants\ncopyright protection to original works of authorship.\n§102(a). Four aspects of copyright law bear explanation at\nthe outset.\n  First, the length of a copyright term. Under the Act, a\ncopyright “vests initially in the author or authors of the\nwork,” who may transfer ownership to a third party. §201.\nThe Act confers on a copyright owner certain exclusive\nrights, including the rights to reproduce and distribute the\nwork and to develop and market derivative works. §106.\nCopyrighted works published before 1978—as was the\nwork at issue—are protected for an initial period of 28\nyears, which may be—and in this case was—extended for\na renewal period of up to 67 years. §304(a). From and\nafter January 1, 1978, works are generally protected from\nthe date of creation until 70 years after the author’s death.\n——————\n   1 As infringement remedies, the Copyright Act provides for injunc-\n\ntions, §502, impoundment and disposition of infringing articles, §503,\ndamages and profits, §504, costs and attorney’s fees, §505. Like other\nrestitutional remedies, recovery of profits “is not easily characterized as\nlegal or equitable,” for it is an “amalgamation of rights and remedies\ndrawn from both systems.” Restatement (Third) of Restitution and\nUnjust Enrichment §4, Comment b, p. 28 (2010). Given the “protean\ncharacter” of the profits-recovery remedy, see id., Comment c, at 30, we\nregard as appropriate its treatment as “equitable” in this case.\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n§302(a).\n   Second, copyright inheritance. For works copyrighted\nunder the pre-1978 regime in which an initial period of\nprotection may be followed by a renewal period, Congress\nprovided that the author’s heirs inherit the renewal rights.\nSee §304(a)(1)(C)(ii)–(iv). We held in Stewart v. Abend,\n495 U. S. 207 (1990), that if an author who has assigned\nher rights away “dies before the renewal period, then the\nassignee may continue to use the original work [to produce\na derivative work] only if the author’s successor transfers\nthe renewal rights to the assignee.” Id., at 221.2\n   Third, remedies. The Act provides a variety of civil\nremedies for infringement, both equitable and legal. See\n§§502–505, described supra, at 2, n. 1. A court may issue\nan injunction “on such terms as it may deem reasonable to\nprevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.” §502(a).\nAt the election of the copyright owner, a court may also\naward either (1) “the copyright owner’s actual damages\nand any additional profits of the infringer,” §504(a)(1),\nwhich petitioner seeks in the instant case, or (2) statutory\ndamages within a defined range, §504(c).\n   Fourth, and most significant here, the statute of limita-\ntions. Until 1957, federal copyright law did not include a\nstatute of limitations for civil suits. Federal courts there-\nfore used analogous state statutes of limitations to deter-\nmine the timeliness of infringement claims. See S. Rep.\nNo. 1014, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1957) (hereinafter\nSenate Report). And they sometimes invoked laches to\nabridge the state-law prescription. As explained in Team-\nsters & Employers Welfare Trust of Ill. v. Gorman Bros.\nReady Mix, 283 F. 3d 877, 881 (CA7 2002): “When Con-\ngress fails to enact a statute of limitations, a [federal]\n——————\n  2 For post-1978 works, heirs still have an opportunity to recapture\n\nrights of the author. See 3 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright\n§11.01[A], p. 11–4 (2013) (hereinafter Nimmer).\n4         PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt that borrows a state statute of limitations but per-\nmits it to be abridged by the doctrine of laches is not in-\nvading congressional prerogatives. It is merely filling a\nlegislative hole.” (internal citation omitted). In 1957,\nCongress addressed the matter and filled the hole; it\nprescribed a three-year look-back limitations period for all\ncivil claims arising under the Copyright Act. See Act of\nSept. 7, 1957, Pub. L. 85–313, 71 Stat. 633, 17 U. S. C.\n§115(b) (1958 ed.). The provision, as already noted, reads:\n“No civil action shall be maintained under the provisions\nof this title unless it is commenced within three years\nafter the claim accrued.” §507(b).3\n  The federal limitations prescription governing copyright\nsuits serves two purposes: (1) to render uniform and cer-\ntain the time within which copyright claims could be\npursued; and (2) to prevent the forum shopping invited by\ndisparate state limitations periods, which ranged from one\nto eight years. Senate Report 2; see H. R. Rep. No. 2419,\n84th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1956). To comprehend how the\nCopyright Act’s limitations period works, one must under-\nstand when a copyright infringement claim accrues.\n  A claim ordinarily accrues “when [a] plaintiff has a\ncomplete and present cause of action.” Bay Area Laundry\nand Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of\nCal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In other words, the limitations period generally\nbegins to run at the point when “the plaintiff can file suit\nand obtain relief.” Ibid. A copyright claim thus arises or\n“accrue[s]” when an infringing act occurs.4\n——————\n  3 The Copyright Act was pervasively revised in 1976, but the three-\n\nyear look-back statute of limitations has remained materially un-\nchanged. See Act of Oct. 19, 1976, §101, 90 Stat. 2586.\n  4 Although we have not passed on the question, nine Courts of Ap-\n\npeals have adopted, as an alternative to the incident of injury rule, a\n“discovery rule,” which starts the limitations period when “the plaintiff\ndiscovers, or with due diligence should have discovered, the injury that\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                       5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   It is widely recognized that the separate-accrual rule\nattends the copyright statute of limitations.5 Under that\nrule, when a defendant commits successive violations, the\nstatute of limitations runs separately from each violation.\nEach time an infringing work is reproduced or distributed,\nthe infringer commits a new wrong. Each wrong gives rise\nto a discrete “claim” that “accrue[s]” at the time the wrong\noccurs.6 In short, each infringing act starts a new limita-\ntions period. See Stone v. Williams, 970 F. 2d 1043, 1049\n(CA2 1992) (“Each act of infringement is a distinct harm\ngiving rise to an independent claim for relief.”).\n   Under the Act’s three-year provision, an infringement is\nactionable within three years, and only three years, of its\noccurrence. And the infringer is insulated from liability\nfor earlier infringements of the same work. See 3 M.\nNimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright §12.05[B][1][b], p. 12–\n150.4 (2013) (“If infringement occurred within three years\nprior to filing, the action will not be barred even if prior\n——————\nforms the basis for the claim.” William A.

Patry, Copyright §20:19, p. 20–28 (2013) (hereinafter Patry) (“The\noverwhelming majority of courts use discovery accrual in copyright\ncases.”).\n   5 See generally id., §20:23, at 20–44; 3 Nimmer §12.05[B][1][b], at 12–\n\n150.2 to 12–150.4. See also, e.g., William A. Graham Co., 568 F. 3d, at\n433; Peter Letterese & Assoc., Inc. v. World Inst. of Scientology Enter-\nprises, Int’l, 533 F. 3d 1287, 1320, n. 39 (CA11 2008); Bridgeport Music,\nInc. v. Rhyme Syndicate Music, 376 F. 3d 615, 621 (CA6 2004); Mak-\nedwde Publishing Co. v. Johnson, 37 F. 3d 180, 182 (CA5 1994); Roley\nv. New World Pictures, Ltd., 19 F. 3d 479, 481 (CA9 1994).\n   6 Separately accruing harm should not be confused with harm from\n\npast violations that are continuing. Compare Klehr v. A. O. Smith\nCorp., 521 U. S. 179, 190 (1997) (for separately accruing harm, each\nnew act must cause “harm [to the plaintiff] over and above the harm\nthat the earlier acts caused”), with Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman,\n455 U. S. 363, 380–381 (1982) (“[W]here a plaintiff . . . challenges . . . an\nunlawful practice that continues into the limitations period, the com-\nplaint is timely when it is filed within [the limitations period, measured\nfrom] the last asserted occurrence of that practice.” (footnote omitted)).\n6          PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\ninfringements by the same party as to the same work are\nbarred because they occurred more than three years pre-\nviously.”). Thus, when a defendant has engaged (or is\nalleged to have engaged) in a series of discrete infringing\nacts, the copyright holder’s suit ordinarily will be timely\nunder §507(b) with respect to more recent acts of in-\nfringement (i.e., acts within the three-year window), but\nuntimely with respect to prior acts of the same or similar\nkind.7\n   In sum, Congress provided two controlling time pre-\nscriptions: the copyright term, which endures for decades,\nand may pass from one generation to another; and\n§507(b)’s limitations period, which allows plaintiffs during\nthat lengthy term to gain retrospective relief running only\n——————\n    7Acase arising outside of the copyright context is illustrative. In Bay\nArea Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of\nCal., 522 U. S. 192 (1997), an employer was delinquent in making a\nseries of scheduled payments to an underfunded pension plan. See id.,\nat 198–199. The trustees filed suit just over six years after the first\nmissed payment, barely outside of the applicable six-year statute of\nlimitations. See id., at 198. Because the first missed payment in the\nseries fell outside the statute of limitations, the employer argued that\nthe subsequent missed payments were also time barred. See id., at\n206. We rejected that argument. The remaining claims were timely,\nwe held, because “each missed payment create[d] a separate cause of\naction with its own six-year limitations period.” Ibid. Cf.

After retiring from the\nring, LaMotta worked with his longtime friend, Frank\nPetrella, to tell the story of the boxer’s career. Their\nventure resulted in three copyrighted works: two screen-\nplays, one registered in 1963, the other in 1973, and a\nbook, registered in 1970. This case centers on the screen-\nplay registered in 1963. The registration identified Frank\nPetrella as sole author, but also stated that the screenplay\nwas written “in collaboration with” LaMotta. App. 164.\n   In 1976, Frank Petrella and LaMotta assigned their\nrights in the three works, including renewal rights, to\nChartoff-Winkler Productions, Inc. Two years later, re-\nspondent United Artists Corporation, a subsidiary of respond-\nent Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (collectively, MGM), ac-\nquired the motion picture rights to the book and both\nscreenplays, rights stated by the parties to be “exclusiv[e]\nand forever, including all periods of copyright and renew-\nals and extensions thereof.” Id., at 49. In 1980, MGM\nreleased, and registered a copyright in, the film Raging\nBull, directed by Martin Scorcese and starring Robert De\nNiro, who won a Best Actor Academy Award for his por-\ntrayal of LaMotta. MGM continues to market the film,\nand has converted it into formats unimagined in 1980,\nincluding DVD and Blu-ray.\n   Frank Petrella died in 1981, during the initial terms of\nthe copyrights in the screenplays and book. As this\nCourt’s decision in Stewart confirmed, Frank Petrella’s\nrenewal rights reverted to his heirs, who could renew the\ncopyrights unburdened by any assignment previously\nmade by the author. See 495 U. S., at 220–221 (relying on\n8            PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt’s earlier decision in Miller Music Corp. v. Charles N.\nDaniels, Inc., 362 U. S. 373 (1960)).\n  Plaintiff below, petitioner here, Paula Petrella (Petrella)\nis Frank Petrella’s daughter. Learning of this Court’s\ndecision in Stewart, Petrella engaged an attorney who, in\n1991, renewed the copyright in the 1963 screenplay.\nBecause the copyrights in the 1973 screenplay and the\n1970 book were not timely renewed, the infringement\nclaims in this case rest exclusively on the screenplay\nregistered in 1963. Petrella is now sole owner of the copy-\nright in that work.8\n  In 1998, seven years after filing for renewal of the copy-\nright in the 1963 screenplay, Petrella’s attorney informed\nMGM that Petrella had obtained the copyright to that\nscreenplay. Exploitation of any derivative work, including\nRaging Bull, the attorney asserted, infringed on the copy-\nright now vested in Petrella. During the next two years,\ncounsel for Petrella and MGM exchanged letters in which\nMGM denied the validity of the infringement claims, and\nPetrella repeatedly threatened to take legal action.\n                             B\n   Some nine years later, on January 6, 2009, Petrella filed\na copyright infringement suit in the United States District\nCourt for the Central District of California. She alleged\nthat MGM violated and continued to violate her copyright\nin the 1963 screenplay by using, producing, and distrib-\nuting Raging Bull, a work she described as derivative of\nthe 1963 screenplay. Petrella’s complaint sought mone-\ntary and injunctive relief. Because the statute of limita-\ntions for copyright claims requires commencement of suit\n“within three years after the claim accrued,” §507(b),\n——————\n    8 Petrella’s\n              attorney filed the renewal application on behalf of Frank\nPetrella’s heirs. When Petrella’s mother died and her brother assigned\nhis rights to her, Petrella became the sole owner of all rights in the\n1963 screenplay.\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nPetrella sought relief only for acts of infringement occur-\nring on or after January 6, 2006. No relief, she recognizes,\ncan be awarded for infringing acts prior to that date.\n   MGM moved for summary judgment on several grounds,\namong them, the equitable doctrine of laches. Petrella’s\n18-year delay, from the 1991 renewal of the copyright on\nwhich she relied, until 2009, when she commenced suit,\nMGM maintained, was unreasonable and prejudicial to\nMGM. See Memorandum of Points and Authorities in\nSupport of Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment in\nNo. CV 09–0072 (CD Cal.).\n   The District Court granted MGM’s motion. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 28a–48a. As to the merits of the infringe-\nment claims, the court found, disputed issues of material\nfact precluded summary adjudication. See id., at 34a–42a.\nEven so, the court held, laches barred Petrella’s complaint.\nId., at 42a–48a. Petrella had unreasonably delayed suit\nby not filing until 2009, the court concluded, and further\ndetermined that MGM was prejudiced by the delay. Id., at\n42a–46a. In particular, the court stated, MGM had shown\n“expectations-based prejudice,” because the company had\n“made significant investments in exploiting the film”; in\naddition, the court accepted that MGM would encounter\n“evidentiary prejudice,” because Frank Petrella had died\nand LaMotta, then aged 88, appeared to have sustained a\nloss of memory. Id., at 44a–46a.9\n   The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit af-\nfirmed the laches-based dismissal. 695 F. 3d 946 (2012).\nUnder Ninth Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals first\nobserved, “[i]f any part of the alleged wrongful conduct\noccurred outside of the limitations period, courts presume\n\n——————\n  9 LaMotta,the court noted, “ha[d] suffered myriad blows to his head\nas a fighter years ago,” and “no longer recognize[d Petrella], even\nthough he ha[d] known her for forty years.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n45a–46a.\n10         PETRELLA v.

The presumption\nwas applicable here, the court indicated, because “[t]he\nstatute of limitations for copyright claims in civil cases is\nthree years,” ibid. (citing §507(b)), and Petrella was aware\nof her potential claims many years earlier (as was MGM),\nid., at 952. “[T]he true cause of Petrella’s delay,” the court\nsuggested, “was, as [Petrella] admits, that ‘the film hadn’t\nmade money’ [in years she deferred suit].” Id., at 953.10\nAgreeing with the District Court, the Ninth Circuit de-\ntermined that MGM had established expectations-based\nprejudice: the company had made a large investment in\nRaging Bull, believing it had complete ownership and\ncontrol of the film. Id., at 953–954.11\n  Judge Fletcher concurred only because Circuit prece-\ndent obliged him to do so. Id., at 958. Laches in copyright\ncases, he observed, is “entirely a judicial creation,” one\nnotably “in tension with Congress’ [provision of a three-\nyear limitations period].” Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the\nCircuits on the application of the equitable defense of\nlaches to copyright infringement claims brought within\nthe three-year look-back period prescribed by Congress.12\n——————\n   10 In her declaration, Petrella stated that MGM told her in 2001 that\n\nthe film was in “a huge deficit financially,” “would never show a profit,”\nand, for that reason, “MGM would not continue to send [financial]\nstatements [to her].” App. 234.\n   11 The Court of Appeals did not consider whether MGM had also\n\nshown evidentiary prejudice. 695 F. 3d 946, 953 (CA9 2012).\n   12 See Lyons Partnership L.

S. ___ (2013).\n                             III\n  We consider first whether, as the Ninth Circuit held,\nlaches may be invoked as a bar to Petrella’s pursuit of\nlegal remedies under 17 U. S. C. §504(b). The Ninth\nCircuit erred, we hold, in failing to recognize that the\ncopyright statute of limitations, §507(b), itself takes ac-\ncount of delay. As earlier observed, see supra, at 5–6, a\nsuccessful plaintiff can gain retrospective relief only three\nyears back from the time of suit. No recovery may be had\nfor infringement in earlier years. Profits made in those\nyears remain the defendant’s to keep. Brought to bear\nhere, §507(b) directs that MGM’s returns on its invest-\nment in Raging Bull in years outside the three-year win-\ndow (years before 2006) cannot be reached by Petrella.\nOnly by disregarding that feature of the statute, and the\nseparate-accrual rule attending §507(b), see supra, at 4–5,\ncould the Court of Appeals presume that infringing acts\noccurring before January 6, 2006 bar all relief, monetary\nand injunctive, for infringement occurring on and after\nthat date. See 695 F. 3d, at 951; supra, at 9–10.13\n  Moreover, if infringement within the three-year look-\nback period is shown, the Act allows the defendant to\n——————\ncompelling of cases”); Jacobsen v. Deseret Book Co., 287 F. 3d 936, 950\n(CA10 2002) (“Rather than deciding copyright cases on the issue of\nlaches, courts should generally defer to the three-year statute of limita-\ntions.”); New Era Publications Int’l v. Henry Holt & Co., 873 F. 2d 576,\n584–585 (CA2 1989) (“severe prejudice, coupled with . . . unconscionable\ndelay . . . mandates denial of . . . injunction for laches and relegation of\n[plaintiff] to its damages remedy”). Cf. post, at 1, 13 (acknowledging\nthat application of laches should be “extraordinary,” confined to “few\nand unusual cases”).\n   13 Assuming Petrella had a winning case on the merits, the Court of\n\nAppeals’ ruling on laches would effectively give MGM a cost-free license\nto exploit Raging Bull throughout the long term of the copyright. The\nvalue to MGM of such a free, compulsory license could exceed by far\nMGM’s expenditures on the film.\n12        PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nprove and offset against profits made in that period “de-\nductible expenses” incurred in generating those profits.\n§504(b). In addition, the defendant may prove and offset\n“elements of profit attributable to factors other than the\ncopyrighted work.” §504(b). The defendant thus may\nretain the return on investment shown to be attributable\nto its own enterprise, as distinct from the value created by\nthe infringed work. See Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pic-\ntures Corp., 309 U. S. 390, 402, 407 (1940) (equitably\napportioning profits to account for independent contribu-\ntions of infringing defendant). See also infra, at 19–22\n(delay in commencing suit as a factor in determining\ncontours of relief appropriately awarded).\n   Last, but hardly least, laches is a defense developed by\ncourts of equity; its principal application was, and re-\nmains, to claims of an equitable cast for which the Legisla-\nture has provided no fixed time limitation. See 1 D.\nDobbs, Law of Remedies §2.4(4), p. 104 (2d ed. 1993) (here-\ninafter Dobbs) (“laches . . . may have originated in equity\nbecause no statute of limitations applied, . . . suggest[ing]\nthat laches should be limited to cases in which no statute\nof limitations applies”). Both before and after the merger\nof law and equity in 1938,14 this Court has cautioned\nagainst invoking laches to bar legal relief. See Holmberg\nv. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 395, 396 (1946) (in actions at\nlaw, “[i]f Congress explicitly puts a limit upon the time for\nenforcing a right which it created, there is an end of the\nmatter,” but “[t]raditionally . . . , statutes of limitation are\nnot controlling measures of equitable relief ”); Merck & Co.\nv.

S. 226, 244, n. 16 (1985) (“[A]pplication of the\nequitable defense of laches in an action at law would be\nnovel indeed.”).15\n   Because we adhere to the position that, in face of a\nstatute of limitations enacted by Congress, laches cannot\nbe invoked to bar legal relief, the dissent thinks we\n“plac[e] insufficient weight upon the rules and practice of\nmodern litigation.” Post, at 12. True, there has been,\nsince 1938, only “one form of action—the civil action.”\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 2. But “the substantive and remedial\nprinciples [applicable] prior to the advent of the federal\nrules [have] not changed.” 4 C. Wright & A. Miller, Fed-\neral Practice and Procedure §1043, p. 177 (3d ed. 2002).\nHolmberg, Merck, and Oneida so illustrate. The dissent\npresents multiple citations, see post, at 1, 3–4, 7–8, 10–11,\nmany of them far afield from the issue at hand, others\nobscuring what the cited decisions in fact ruled. Compare,\ne.g., post, at 1, 11, with infra, at 20–21 (describing Chirco\n——————\n  15 In contrast to the Copyright Act, the Lanham Act, which governs\ntrademarks, contains no statute of limitations, and expressly provides\nfor defensive use of “equitable principles, including laches.” 15 U.

Turtle Wax,\nInc., 191 F. 3d 813 (CA7 1999), but failing to observe that Lanham Act\ncontains no statute of limitations).\n   The Patent Act states: “[N]o recovery shall be had for any infringe-\nment committed more than six years prior to the filing of the com-\nplaint.” 35 U.

The Act also provides that “[n]onin-\nfringement, absence of liability for infringement or unenforceability”\nmay be raised “in any action involving the validity or infringement\nof a patent.” §282(b) (2012 ed.). Based in part on §282 and com-\nmentary thereon, legislative history, and historical practice, the Fed-\neral Circuit has held that laches can bar damages incurred prior to\nthe commencement of suit, but not injunctive relief. A. C. Aukerman\nCo. v. R. L. Chaides Constr. Co., 960 F. 2d 1020, 1029–1031, 1039–1041\n(1992) (en banc). We have not had occasion to review the Federal\nCircuit’s position.\n14       PETRELLA v.

S. 101 (2002)); post, at 8, with infra, at 15, n. 16\n(describing Patterson v. Hewitt, 195 U. S. 309 (1904)). Yet\ntellingly, the dissent has come up with no case in which\nthis Court has approved the application of laches to bar a\nclaim for damages brought within the time allowed by a\nfederal statute of limitations. There is nothing at all\n“differen[t],” see post, at 12, about copyright cases in this\nregard.\n                           IV\n  We turn now to MGM’s principal arguments regarding\nthe contemporary scope of the laches defense, all of them\nembraced by the dissent.\n                                A\n   Laches is listed among affirmative defenses, along with,\nbut discrete from, the statute of limitations, in Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 8(c). Accordingly, MGM main-\ntains, the plea is “available . . . in every civil action” to bar\nall forms of relief. Tr. of Oral Arg. 43; see Brief for Re-\nspondents 40. To the Court’s question, could laches apply\nwhere there is an ordinary six-year statute of limitations,\nMGM’s counsel responded yes, case-specific circumstances\nmight warrant a ruling that a suit brought in year five\ncame too late. Tr. of Oral Arg. 52; see id., at 41.\n   The expansive role for laches MGM envisions careens\naway from understandings, past and present, of the essen-\ntially gap-filling, not legislation-overriding, office of laches.\nNothing in this Court’s precedent suggests a doctrine\nof such sweep. Quite the contrary, we have never applied\nlaches to bar in their entirety claims for discrete wrongs\noccurring within a federally prescribed limitations pe-\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

See supra, at 3–4.\n                              B\n  MGM observes that equitable tolling “is read into every\nfederal statute of limitation,” Holmberg, 327 U. S., at 397,\nand asks why laches should not be treated similarly. See\nBrief for Respondents 23–26; post, at 7–8. Tolling, which\nlengthens the time for commencing a civil action in appro-\npriate circumstances,17 applies when there is a statute of\n——————\n  16 MGM    pretends otherwise, but the cases on which it relies do not\ncarry the load MGM would put on them. Morgan, described supra, at 6,\nn. 7, is apparently MGM’s best case, for it is cited 13 times in MGM’s\nbrief. See Brief for Respondents 8, 9, 14, 16, 18, 19, 25, 31, 34, 35, 36,\n40, 47; post, at 1, 7, 10–11. Morgan, however, does not so much as hint\nthat laches may bar claims for discrete wrongs, all of them occurring\nwithin a federal limitations period. Part II–A of that opinion, dealing\nwith the separate-accrual rule, held that “[e]ach discrete discriminatory\nact starts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act,” regardless of\nwhether “past acts” are time barred. 536 U. S., at 113. Parts II–B and\nII–C of the opinion then distinguished separately accruing wrongs from\nhostile-work-environment claims, cumulative in effect and extending\nover long periods of time. Id., at 115–117, 121. Laches could be in-\nvoked, the Court reasoned, to limit the continuing violation doctrine’s\npotential to rescue untimely claims, not claims accruing separately\nwithin the limitations period.\n  Bay Area Laundry, described, along with Morgan, supra, at 6, n. 7, is\nsimilarly featured by MGM. See also post, at 7–8, 11. But that opinion\nconsidered laches only in the context of a federal statute calling for\naction “[a]s soon as practicable.” 29 U. S. C. §1399(b)(1); see 522 U. S.,\nat 205. Patterson v. Hewitt, 195 U. S. 309 (1904), described by MGM as\na case resembling Petrella’s, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–33, 53, barred\nequitable claims that were timely under state law. When state law was\nthe reference, federal courts sometimes applied laches as a further\ncontrol. See supra, at 3–4; Russel v. Todd, 309 U. S. 280, 288, n. 1\n(1940) (“Laches may bar equitable remedy before the local statute has\nrun.”). No federal statute of limitations figured in Patterson.\n  17 E.g., a party’s infancy or mental disability, absence of the defend-\n16         PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nlimitations; it is, in effect, a rule of interpretation tied to\nthat limit. See Young v. United States, 535 U. S. 43, 49–\n50 (2002); Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421\nU. S. 454, 464 (1975).18 Laches, in contrast, originally\nserved as a guide when no statute of limitations controlled\nthe claim; it can scarcely be described as a rule for inter-\npreting a statutory prescription. That is so here, because\nthe statute, §507(b), makes the starting trigger an infring-\ning act committed three years back from the commence-\nment of suit, while laches, as conceived by the Ninth\nCircuit and advanced by MGM, makes the presumptive\ntrigger the defendant’s initial infringing act. See 695\nF. 3d, at 951; Brief for United States 16.\n                              C\n  MGM insists that the defense of laches must be avail-\nable to prevent a copyright owner from sitting still, doing\nnothing, waiting to see what the outcome of an alleged\ninfringer’s investment will be. See Brief for Respondents\n48. In this case, MGM stresses, “[Petrella] conceded that\nshe waited to file because ‘the film was deeply in debt and\nin the red and would probably never recoup.’ ” Id., at 47\n(quoting from App. 110). The Ninth Circuit similarly\nfaulted Petrella for waiting to sue until the film Raging\nBull “made money.” 695 F. 3d, at 953 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). See also post, at 3–6 (deploring plaintiffs\nwho wait to see whether the allegedly infringing work\nmakes money).\n  It is hardly incumbent on copyright owners, however, to\nchallenge each and every actionable infringement. And\n——————\nant from the jurisdiction, fraudulent concealment. See S. Rep. No.\n1014, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 2–3 (1957) (hereinafter Senate Report).\n  18 The legislative history to which the dissent refers, post, at 7, speaks\n\nof “equitable situations on which the statute of limitations is generally\nsuspended,” Senate Report 3, and says nothing about laches shrinking\nthe time Congress allowed.\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthere is nothing untoward about waiting to see whether an\ninfringer’s exploitation undercuts the value of the copy-\nrighted work, has no effect on the original work, or even\ncomplements it. Fan sites prompted by a book or film, for\nexample, may benefit the copyright owner. See Wu, Tol-\nerated Use, 31 Colum. J. L. & Arts 617, 619–620 (2008).\nEven if an infringement is harmful, the harm may be too\nsmall to justify the cost of litigation.\n   If the rule were, as MGM urges, “sue soon, or forever\nhold your peace,” copyright owners would have to mount a\nfederal case fast to stop seemingly innocuous infringe-\nments, lest those infringements eventually grow in magni-\ntude. Section 507(b)’s three-year limitations period, how-\never, coupled to the separate-accrual rule, see supra, at\n3–6, avoids such litigation profusion. It allows a copyright\nowner to defer suit until she can estimate whether litiga-\ntion is worth the candle. She will miss out on damages for\nperiods prior to the three-year look-back, but her right to\nprospective injunctive relief should, in most cases, remain\nunaltered.19\n                              D\n  MGM points to the danger that evidence needed or\nuseful to defend against liability will be lost during a\ncopyright owner’s inaction.

METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1978 copyrights, 28 years after a work was written and\ncopyrighted. See, supra, at 2–3. At that time, the author,\nand perhaps other witnesses to the creation of the work,\nwill be dead. See supra, at 7. Congress must have been\naware that the passage of time and the author’s death\ncould cause a loss or dilution of evidence. Congress chose,\nnonetheless, to give the author’s family “a second chance\nto obtain fair remuneration.” Stewart, 495 U. S., at 220.\n   Moreover, a copyright plaintiff bears the burden of\nproving infringement. See 3 W. Patry, Copyright §9.4,\np. 9–18 (2013) (hereinafter Patry) (“As in other civil litiga-\ntion, a copyright owner bears the burden of establishing a\nprima facie case.”). But cf. post, at 4 (overlooking plain-\ntiff ’s burden to show infringement and the absence of any\nburden upon the defendant “to prove that it did not in-\nfringe”). Any hindrance caused by the unavailability of\nevidence, therefore, is at least as likely to affect plaintiffs\nas it is to disadvantage defendants. That is so in cases of\nthe kind Petrella is pursuing, for a deceased author most\nprobably would have supported his heir’s claim.\n   The registration mechanism, we further note, reduces\nthe need for extrinsic evidence. Although registration is\n“permissive,” both the certificate and the original work\nmust be on file with the Copyright Office before a copy-\nright owner can sue for infringement. §§408(b), 411(a).\nKey evidence in the litigation, then, will be the certificate,\nthe original work, and the allegedly infringing work. And\nthe adjudication will often turn on the factfinder’s direct\ncomparison of the original and the infringing works, i.e.,\non the factfinder’s “good eyes and common sense” in com-\nparing the two works’ “total concept and overall feel.”\nPeter F.

See 6 Patry §20:58, at 20–\n110 to 20–112.21 The test for estoppel is more exacting\nthan the test for laches, and the two defenses are differ-\nently oriented. The gravamen of estoppel, a defense long\nrecognized as available in actions at law, see Wehrman v.\nConklin, 155 U. S. 314, 327 (1894), is misleading and\nconsequent loss, see 6 Patry §20:58, at 20–110 to 20–112.\nDelay may be involved, but is not an element of the de-\nfense. For laches, timeliness is the essential element. In\ncontrast to laches, urged by MGM entirely to override the\nstatute of limitations Congress prescribed, estoppel does\nnot undermine Congress’ prescription, for it rests on mis-\nleading, whether engaged in early on, or later in time.\n  Stating that the Ninth Circuit “ha[d] taken a wrong\nturn in its formulation and application of laches in copy-\nright cases,” Judge Fletcher called for fresh consideration\nof the issue. 695 F. 3d, at 959. “A recognition of the dis-\ntinction between . . . estoppel and laches,” he suggested,\n“would be a good place to start.” Ibid. We agree.\n                            V\n  The courts below summarily disposed of Petrella’s case\nbased on laches, preventing adjudication of any of her\nclaims on the merits and foreclosing the possibility of any\nform of relief. That disposition, we have explained, was\nerroneous. Congress’ time provisions secured to authors a\n——————\n  21 Although  MGM, in its answer to Petrella’s complaint, separately\nraised both laches and estoppel as affirmative defenses, see Defendants’\nAnswer to Plaintiff’s Complaint in No. CV 09–0072 (CD Cal.), the\ncourts below did not address the estoppel plea.\n20      PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncopyright term of long duration, and a right to sue for\ninfringement occurring no more than three years back\nfrom the time of suit. That regime leaves “little place” for\na doctrine that would further limit the timeliness of a\ncopyright owner’s suit. See 1 Dobbs §2.6(1), at 152. In\nextraordinary circumstances, however, the consequences\nof a delay in commencing suit may be of sufficient magni-\ntude to warrant, at the very outset of the litigation, cur-\ntailment of the relief equitably awardable.\n   Chirco v. Crosswinds Communities, Inc., 474 F. 3d 227\n(CA6 2007), is illustrative. In that case, the defendants\nwere alleged to have used without permission, in planning\nand building a housing development, the plaintiffs’ copy-\nrighted architectural design. Long aware of the defend-\nants’ project, the plaintiffs took no steps to halt the hous-\ning development until more than 168 units were built, 109\nof which were occupied. Id., at 230. Although the action\nwas filed within §507(b)’s three-year statute of limitations,\nthe District Court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants, dismissing the entire case on grounds of laches.\nThe trial court’s rejection of the entire suit could not\nstand, the Court of Appeals explained, for it was not within\nthe Judiciary’s ken to debate the wisdom of §507(b)’s\nthree-year look-back prescription. Id., at 235. Neverthe-\nless, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s\njudgment to this extent: The plaintiffs, even if they might\nsucceed in proving infringement of their copyrighted de-\nsign, would not be entitled to an order mandating destruc-\ntion of the housing project. That relief would be inequit-\nable, the Sixth Circuit held, for two reasons: the plaintiffs\nknew of the defendants’ construction plans before the de-\nfendants broke ground, yet failed to take readily available\nmeasures to stop the project; and the requested relief\nwould “work an unjust hardship” upon the defendants and\ninnocent third parties. Id., at 236. See also New Era\nPublications Int’l v. Henry Holt & Co., 873 F. 2d 576, 584–\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Petrella notified MGM of her copyright\nclaims before MGM invested millions of dollars in creating\na new edition of Raging Bull. And the equitable relief\nPetrella seeks—e.g., disgorgement of unjust gains and an\ninjunction against future infringement—would not result\nin “total destruction” of the film, or anything close to it.\nSee New Era, 873 F. 2d, at 584. MGM released Raging\nBull more than three decades ago and has marketed it\ncontinuously since then. Allowing Petrella’s suit to go\nforward will put at risk only a fraction of the income MGM\nhas earned during that period and will work no unjust\nhardship on innocent third parties, such as consumers\nwho have purchased copies of Raging Bull. Cf. Chirco, 474\nF. 3d, at 235–236 (destruction remedy would have ousted\nfamilies from recently purchased homes). The circum-\nstances here may or may not (we need not decide) warrant\nlimiting relief at the remedial stage, but they are not\nsufficiently extraordinary to justify threshold dismissal.\n   Should Petrella ultimately prevail on the merits, the\nDistrict Court, in determining appropriate injunctive relief\nand assessing profits, may take account of her delay in\ncommencing suit. See supra, at 1–2, 11–12. In doing so,\nhowever, that court should closely examine MGM’s alleged\n22        PETRELLA v.

METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nToday’s decision disables federal courts from addressing\nthat inequity. I respectfully dissent.\n                               I\n   Circumstances warranting the application of laches in\nthe context of copyright claims are not difficult to imagine.\nThe 3-year limitations period under the Copyright Act\nmay seem brief, but it is not. 17 U. S. C. §507(b). That is\nbecause it is a rolling limitations period, which restarts\nupon each “separate accrual” of a claim. See ante, at 5; 6\nW. Patry, Copyright §20:23, pp. 20–44 to 20–46 (2013). If\na defendant reproduces or sells an infringing work on a\ncontinuing basis, a plaintiff can sue every 3 years until the\ncopyright term expires—which may be up to 70 years after\nthe author’s death. §302(a) (works created after January\n1, 1978, are protected until 70 years after the author’s\ndeath); §304(a) (works created before January 1, 1978, are\nprotected for 28 years plus a 67-year renewal period). If,\nfor example, a work earns no money for 20 years, but then,\nafter development expenses have been incurred, it earns\nprofits for the next 30, a plaintiff can sue in year 21 and at\nregular 3-year intervals thereafter. Each time the plain-\ntiff will collect the defendant’s profits earned during the\nprior three years, unless he settles for a lump sum along\nthe way. The defendant will recoup no more than his\noutlays and any “elements of profit attributable to factors\nother than the copyrighted work.” §§504(a)(1), (b).\n   A 20-year delay in bringing suit could easily prove\ninequitable. Suppose, for example, the plaintiff has delib-\nerately waited for the death of witnesses who might prove\nthe existence of understandings about a license to repro-\nduce the copyrighted work, or who might show that the\nplaintiff ’s work was in fact derived from older copyrighted\nmaterials that the defendant has licensed. Or, suppose\nthe plaintiff has delayed in bringing suit because he wants\nto avoid bargaining with the defendant up front over a\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlicense. He knows that if he delays legal action, and the\ndefendant invests time, effort, and resources into making\nthe derivative product, the plaintiff will be in a much\nstronger position to obtain favorable licensing terms\nthrough settlement. Or, suppose the plaintiff has waited\nuntil he becomes certain that the defendant’s production\nbet paid off, that the derivative work did and would con-\ntinue to earn money, and that the plaintiff has a chance of\nobtaining, say, an 80% share of what is now a 90% pure\nprofit stream. (N. B. The plaintiff ’s profits recovery will\nbe reduced by any “deductible expenses” incurred by the\ndefendant in producing the work, and by any “elements of\nprofits attributable to factors other than the copyrighted\nwork,” §504(b)). Or, suppose that all of these circumstances\nexist together.\n   Cases that present these kinds of delays are not imagi-\nnary. One can easily find examples from the lower courts\nwhere plaintiffs have brought claims years after they\naccrued and where delay-related inequity resulted. See,\ne.g., Ory v. McDonald, 141 Fed.

The petitioner claims\nthe MGM film Raging Bull violated a copyright originally\nowned by her father, which she inherited and then re-\nnewed in 1991. She waited 18 years after renewing the\ncopyright, until 2009, to bring suit. During those 18 years,\nMGM spent millions of dollars developing different edi-\ntions of, and marketing, the film. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 13a. MGM also entered into numerous licensing\nagreements, some of which allowed television networks to\nbroadcast the film through 2015. Id., at 14a. Meanwhile,\nthree key witness died or became unavailable, making it\nmore difficult for MGM to prove that it did not infringe the\npetitioner’s copyright (either because the 1963 screenplay\nwas in fact derived from a different book, the rights to\nwhich MGM owned under a nonchallenged license, or\nbecause MGM held a license to the screenplay under a\n1976 agreement that it signed with Jake LaMotta, who\ncoauthored the screenplay with the petitioner’s father, see\nid. at 3a, 5a; App. 128–129, 257–258, 266–267). Conse-\nquently, I believe the Court of Appeals acted lawfully in\ndismissing the suit due to laches.\n   Long delays do not automatically prove inequity, but,\ndepending upon the circumstances, they raise that possi-\nbility. Indeed, suppose that that the copyright-holders in\nthe song cases cited above, or their heirs, facing sudden\nrevivals in demand or eventual deaths of witnesses, had\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nbrought their claims 50, or even 60 years after those\nclaims first accrued. Or suppose that the loss of evidence\nwas clearly critical to the defendants’ abilities to prove\ntheir cases. The Court holds that insofar as a copyright\nclaim seeks damages, a court cannot ever apply laches,\nirrespective of the length of the plaintiff ’s delay, the\namount of the harm that it caused, or the inequity of\npermitting the action to go forward.\n                                II\n   Why should laches not be available in an appropriate\ncase? Consider the reasons the majority offers. First, the\nmajority says that the 3-year “copyright statute of limita-\ntions . . . itself takes account of delay,” and so additional\nsafeguards like laches are not needed. Ante, at 11. I agree\nthat sometimes that is so. But I also fear that sometimes\nit is not. The majority correctly points out that the limita-\ntions period limits the retrospective relief a plaintiff can\nrecover. It imposes a cap equal to the profits earned dur-\ning the prior three years, in addition to any actual damages\nsustained during this time. Ibid.; §504(b). Thus, if the\nplaintiff waits from, say, 1980 until 2001 to bring suit, she\ncannot recover profits for the 1980 to 1998 period. But she\ncan recover the defendant’s profits from 1998 through\n2001, which might be precisely when net revenues turned\npositive. And she can sue every three years thereafter\nuntil the copyright expires, perhaps in the year 2060. If\nthe plaintiff ’s suit involves the type of inequitable circum-\nstances I have described, her ability to recover profits from\n1998 to 2001 and until the copyright expires could be just\nthe kind of unfairness that laches is designed to prevent.\n   Second, the majority points out that the plaintiff can\nrecover only the defendant’s profits less “ ‘deductible ex-\npenses’ incurred in generating those profits.” Ante, at 12\n(quoting §504(b)). In other words, the majority takes\nassurance from the fact that the Act enables the defendant\n6       PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto recoup his outlays in developing or selling the allegedly\ninfringing work. Again, sometimes that fact will prevent\ninequitable results. But sometimes it will not. A plain-\ntiff ’s delay may mean that the defendant has already\nrecovered the majority of his expenses, and what is left is\nprimarily profit. It may mean that the defendant has\ndedicated decades of his life to producing the work, such\nthat the loss of a future profit stream (even if he can re-\ncover past expenses) is tantamount to the loss of any\nincome in later years. And in circumstances such as those\ndescribed, it could prove inequitable to give the profit to a\nplaintiff who has unnecessarily delayed in filing an action.\nSimply put, the “deductible expenses” provision does not\nprotect the defendant from the potential inequity high-\nlighted by Judge Hand nearly 100 years ago in his influ-\nential copyright opinion. That is, it does not stop a\ncopyright-holder (or his heirs) from “stand[ing] inactive\nwhile the proposed infringer spends large sums of money”\nin a risky venture; appearing on the scene only when the\nventure has proved a success; and thereby collecting sub-\nstantially more money than he could have obtained at the\noutset, had he bargained with the investor over a license\nand royalty fee. Haas, 234 F., at 108. But cf. id., at 108–\n109 (plaintiff to receive injunctive relief since one of the\ndefendants was a “deliberate pirate,” but profit award to\nbe potentially reduced in light of laches).\n   Third, the majority says that “[i]nviting individual\njudges to set a time limit other than the one Congress\nprescribed” in the Copyright Act would “tug against the\nuniformity Congress sought to achieve when it enacted\n§507(b).” Ante, at 15. But why does the majority believe\nthat part of what Congress intended to “achieve” was the\nelimination of the equitable defense of laches? As the\nmajority recognizes, Congress enacted a uniform statute of\nlimitations for copyright claims in 1957 so that federal\ncourts, in determining timeliness, no longer had to borrow\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfrom state law which varied from place to place. See ante,\nat 3–4. Nothing in the 1957 Act—or anywhere else in the\ntext of the copyright statute—indicates that Congress also\nsought to bar the operation of laches. The Copyright Act\nis silent on the subject. And silence is consistent, not\ninconsistent, with the application of equitable doctrines.\n   For one thing, the legislative history for §507 shows that\nCongress chose not to “specifically enumerat[e] certain\nequitable considerations which might be advanced in\nconnection with civil copyright actions” because it under-\nstood that “ ‘[f]ederal district courts, generally, recognize\nthese equitable defenses anyway.’ ” S. Rep. No. 1014, 85th\nCong., 1st Sess., 2–3 (1957) (quoting the House Judiciary\nCommittee). Courts prior to 1957 had often applied laches\nin federal copyright cases. See, e.g., Callaghan v. Myers,\n128 U. S. 617, 658–659 (1888) (assuming laches was an\navailable defense in a copyright suit); Edwin L. Wiegand\nCo. v. Harold E. Trent Co., 122 F. 2d 920, 925 (CA3 1941)\n(applying laches to bar a copyright suit); D. O. Haynes &\nCo. v. Druggists’ Circular, 32 F. 2d 215, 216–218 (CA2\n1929) (same). Congress expected they would continue to\ndo so.\n   Furthermore, this Court has held that federal courts\nmay “appl[y] equitable doctrines that may toll or limit the\ntime period” for suit when applying a statute of limita-\ntions, because a statutory “filing period” is a “requirement”\nsubject to adjustment “ ‘when equity so requires.’ ” Mor-\ngan, 536 U. S., at 121–122 (quoting Zipes v. Trans World\nAirlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 398 (1982); emphasis added).\nThis Court has read laches into statutes of limitations\notherwise silent on the topic of equitable doctrines in a\nmultitude of contexts, as have lower courts. See, e.g.,\nMorgan, supra, at 121 (“an employer may raise a laches\ndefense” under Title VII); Bay Area Laundry and Dry\nCleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522\nU. S. 192, 205 (1997) (similar, in respect to suits under the\n8        PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nMultiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980\n(MPPAA)); Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136,\n155 (1967) (similar, in respect to an action for declaratory\nand injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure\nAct); Patterson v. Hewitt, 195 U. S. 309, 319–320 (1904)\n(similar, in the case of a property action brought within\nNew Mexico’s statute of limitations); Alsop v. Riker, 155\nU. S. 448, 460 (1894) (holding that “independently of the\nstatute of limitations,” the contract action was barred\n“because of laches”); Teamsters & Employers Welfare Trust\nof Ill. v. Gorman Bros. Ready Mix, 283 F. 3d 877, 883 (CA7\n2002) (laches available “in a suit against an [Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974] (ERISA)] plan for\nbenefits”); Hot Wax, Inc. v. Turtle Wax, Inc., 191 F. 3d 813,\n822–823 (CA7 1999) (laches available in a Lanham Act\nsuit filed within the limitations period). Unless Congress\nindicates otherwise, courts normally assume that equita-\nble rules continue to operate alongside limitations periods,\nand that equity applies both to plaintiffs and to defend-\nants. See Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501\nU. S. 104, 108 (1991) (“Congress is understood to legislate\nagainst a background of common-law adjudicatory princi-\nples” and to incorporate them “except when a statutory\npurpose to the contrary is evident” (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted)); Porter v. Warner Holding\nCo., 328 U. S. 395, 398 (1946) (“Unless otherwise provided\nby statute, all the inherent equitable powers of the Dis-\ntrict Court are available for the proper and complete\nexercise of that jurisdiction”).\n   The Court today comes to a different conclusion. It\nreads §507(b)’s silence as preserving doctrines that\nlengthen the period for suit when equitable considerations\nfavor the plaintiff (e.g., equitable tolling), but as foreclos-\ning a doctrine that would shorten the period when equity\nfavors the defendant (i.e., laches). See ante, at 15–16, 19–\n20. I do not understand the logic of reading a silent stat-\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nute in this manner.\n  Fourth, the majority defends its rule by observing that\nlaches was “developed by courts of equity,” and that this\nCourt has “cautioned against invoking laches to bar legal\nrelief ” even following the merger of law and equity in\n1938. Ante, at 12–13. The majority refers to three cases\nthat offer support for this proposition, but none is deter-\nminative. In the first, Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S.\n392 (1946), the Court said:\n    “If Congress explicitly puts a limit upon the time for\n    enforcing a right which it created, there is an end of\n    the matter.\n      .           .          .           .           .\n    “Traditionally and for good reasons, statutes of limita-\n    tion are not controlling measures of equitable relief.”\n    Id., at 395–396.\nThis statement, however, constituted part of the Court’s\nexplanation as to why a federal statute, silent about limi-\ntations, should be applied consistently with “historic prin-\nciples of equity in the enforcement of federally-created\nequitable rights” rather than with New York’s statute of\nlimitations. Id., at 395. The case had nothing to do with\nwhether laches governs in actions at law. The lawsuit in\nHolmberg had been brought “in equity,” and the Court\nremanded for a determination of whether the petitioners\nwere “chargeable with laches.” Id., at 393, 397.\n  The second case the majority cites, Merck & Co. v. Reyn-\nolds, 559 U. S. 633 (2010), provides some additional sup-\nport, but not much. There, the Court cited a 1935 case for\nthe proposition that “ ‘[l]aches within the term of the stat-\nute of limitations is no defense at law.’ ” Id., at 652 (quot-\ning United States v. Mack, 295 U. S. 480, 489 (1935)). But\nMerck concerned a federal securities statute that con-\ntained both a 2-year statute of limitations, running from\nthe time of “discovery,” and a 5-year statute of repose,\n10      PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrunning from the time of a “violation.” Id., at 638 (citing\n28 U. S. C. §1658(b)). Given that repose statutes set “an\noutside limit” on suit and are generally “inconsistent with\ntolling” and similar equitable doctrines, the Court held\nthat the 2-year limitations period at issue was not subject\nto an “inquiry notice” rule or, by analogy, to laches. Lampf,\nPleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S.\n350, 363 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted); Merck, supra, at 650–652. Merck did not suggest\nthat statutes of limitations are always or normally incon-\nsistent with equitable doctrines when plaintiffs seek dam-\nages. It simply found additional support for its conclusion\nin a case that this Court decided before the merger of law\nand equity. And here, unlike in Merck, the statute of\nlimitations is not accompanied by a corollary statute of\nrepose.\n   Third, in County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of\nN. Y., 470 U. S. 226 (1985), the Court said in a footnote\nthat “application of the equitable defense of laches in an\naction at law would be novel indeed.” Id., at 245, n. 16.\nThis statement was made in light of special policies re-\nlated to Indian tribes, which the Court went on to discuss in\nthe following sentences. Ibid. In any event, Oneida did\nnot resolve whether laches was available to the defend-\nants, for the lower court had not ruled on the issue. Id., at\n244–245.\n   In sum, there is no reason to believe that the Court\nmeant any of its statements in Holmberg, Merck, or Oneida\nto announce a general rule about the availability of\nlaches in actions for legal relief, whenever Congress pro-\nvides a statute of limitations. To the contrary, the Court\nhas said more than once that a defendant could invoke\nlaches in an action for damages (even though no assertion\nof the defense had actually been made in the case), despite\na fixed statute of limitations. See Morgan, 536 U. S., at\n116–119, 121–122 (laches available in hostile work envi-\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

S., at 205 (laches available in ac-\ntions for “withdrawal liability assessment[s]” under the\nMPPAA). Lower courts have come to similar holdings in a\nwide array of circumstances—often approving not only of\nthe availability of the laches defense, but of its application\nto the case at hand. E.g., Cayuga Indian Nation of N. Y. v.\nPataki, 413 F. 3d 266, 274–277 (CA2 2005) (laches avail-\nable in a “possessory land claim” in which the District\nCourt awarded damages, whether “characterized as an\naction at law or in equity,” and dismissing the action due\nto laches); Teamsters, 283 F. 3d, at 881–883 (laches avail-\nable in suits under ERISA for benefits, but not warranted\nin that case); Hot Wax, 191 F. 3d, at 822–827 (“[T]he ap-\nplication of the doctrine of laches to Hot Wax’s Lanham\nAct claims [requesting damages] by the district court was\nproper”); A. C. Aukerman Co. v. R. L. Chaides Constr. Co.,\n960 F. 2d 1020, 1030–1032, 1045–1046 (CAFed 1992) (en\nbanc) (laches available in patent suit claiming damages,\nand remanding for whether the defense was successful);\nCornetta v. United States, 851 F. 2d 1372, 1376–1383\n(CAFed 1988) (en banc) (same, in suit seeking backpay).\nEven if we focus only upon federal copyright litigation,\nfour of the six Circuits to have considered the matter have\nheld that laches can bar claims for legal relief. See 695\nF. 3d 946, 956 (CA9 2012) (case below, barring all copy-\nright claims due to laches); Peter Letterese & Assocs., Inc.\nv. World Inst. of Scientology Enterprises, Int’l, 533 F. 3d\n1287, 1319–1322 (CA11 2008) (laches can bar copyright\nclaims for retrospective damages); Chirco, 474 F. 3d, at\n234–236 (“laches can be argued ‘regardless of whether the\nsuit is at law or in equity,’ ” and holding that while the\nplaintiffs could obtain damages and an injunction, their\nrequest for additional equitable relief “smack[ed] of the\ninequity against which Judge Hand cautioned in Haas and\nwhich the judicial system should abhor” (quoting Team-\n12       PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsters, supra, at 881)); Jacobsen v. Deseret Book Co., 287 F.\n3d 936, 950–951 (CA10 2002) (laches available in “ ‘rare\ncases,’ ” and failing to draw a distinction in the type of\nremedy sought (citation omitted). But see New Era Publi-\ncations Int’l v. Henry Holt & Co., 873 F. 2d 576, 584–585\n(CA2 1989) (laches can bar claims for injunctive relief, but\nnot damages, under the Copyright Act); Lyons Partner-\nship, L. P. v. Morris Costumes, Inc., 243 F. 3d 789, 798–\n799 (CA4 2001) (laches unavailable in copyright cases\naltogether).\n   Perhaps more importantly, in permitting laches to apply\nto copyright claims seeking equitable relief but not to\nthose seeking legal relief, the majority places insufficient\nweight upon the rules and practice of modern litigation.\nSince 1938, Congress and the Federal Rules have replaced\nwhat would once have been actions “at law” and actions\n“in equity” with the “civil action.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 2\n(“There is one form of action—the civil action”). A federal\ncivil action is subject to both equitable and legal defenses.\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c)(1) (“In responding to a pleading, a\nparty must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirma-\ntive defense, including: . . . estoppel . . . laches . . . [and]\nstatute of limitations”). Accordingly, since 1938, federal\ncourts have frequently allowed defendants to assert what\nwere formerly equitable defenses—including laches—in\nwhat were formerly legal actions. See supra, at 10–11\n(citing cases). Why should copyright be treated differ-\nently? Indeed, the majority concedes that “restitutional\nremedies” like “profits” (which are often claimed in copy-\nright cases) defy clear classification as “equitable” or\n“legal.” Ante, at 2, n. 1 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Why should lower courts have to make these uneasy\nand unnatural distinctions?\n   Fifth, the majority believes it can prevent the inequities\nthat laches seeks to avoid through the use of a different\ndoctrine, namely equitable estoppel. Ante, at 19. I doubt\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat is so. As the majority recognizes, “the two defenses\nare differently oriented.” Ibid. The “gravamen” of estop-\npel is a misleading representation by the plaintiff that the\ndefendant relies on to his detriment. 6 Patry, Copyright\n§20:58, at 20–110 to 20–112. The gravamen of laches is\nthe plaintiff ’s unreasonable delay, and the consequent\nprejudice to the defendant. Id., §20:54, at 20–96. Where\ndue to the passage of time, evidence favorable to the de-\nfense has disappeared or the defendant has continued to\ninvest in a derivative work, what misleading representa-\ntion by the plaintiff is there to estop?\n   In sum, as the majority says, the doctrine of laches may\noccupy only a “ ‘little place’ ” in a regime based upon stat-\nutes of limitations. Ante, at 20 (quoting 1 D. Dobbs, Law\nof Remedies §2.6(1), p. 152 (2d ed. 1993)). But that place\nis an important one. In those few and unusual cases\nwhere a plaintiff unreasonably delays in bringing suit and\nconsequently causes inequitable harm to the defendant,\nthe doctrine permits a court to bring about a fair result. I\nsee no reason to erase the doctrine from copyright’s lexi-\ncon, not even in respect to limitations periods applicable to\ndamages actions.\n   Consequently, with respect, I dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 2674861, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/05/19/petrella_v._metro-goldwyn-mayer_inc..pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 21, 2014—Decided May 19, 2014\nThe Copyright Act (Act) protects copyrighted works published before\n  1978 for an initial period of 28 years, renewable for a period of up to\n  67 years. 17 U. S. C. §304(a). The author’s heirs inherit the renewal\n  rights. See §304(a)(1)(C)(ii)–(iv). When an author who has assigned\n  her rights away “dies before the renewal period, . . . the assignee may\n  continue to use the original work only if the author’s successor trans-\n  fers the renewal rights to the assignee,” Stewart v. Abend, 495 U. S.\n  207, 221. The Act provides both equitable and legal remedies for in-\n  fringement: an injunction “on such terms as [a court] may deem rea-\n  sonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright,” §502(a);\n  and, at the copyright owner’s election, either (1) the “owner’s actual\n  damages and any additional profits of the infringer,” §504(a)(1),\n  which petitioner seeks in this case, or (2) specified statutory damag-\n  es, §504(c). The Act’s statute of limitations provides: “No civil action\n  shall be maintained under the [Act] unless it is commenced within\n  three years after the claim accrued.” §507(b). A claim ordinarily ac-\n  crues when an infringing act occurs. Under the separate-accrual rule\n  that attends the copyright statute of limitations, when a defendant\n  has committed successive violations, each infringing act starts a new\n  limitations period. However, under §507(b), each infringement is ac-\n  tionable only within three years of its occurrence.\n     Here, the allegedly infringing work is the motion picture Raging\n  Bull, based on the life of boxing champion Jake LaMotta, who, with\n  Frank Petrella, told his story in, inter alia, a screenplay copyrighted\n  in 1963. In 1976, the pair assigned their rights and renewal rights,\n  which were later acquired by respondent United Artists Corporation,\n  a subsidiary of respondent Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (collectively,\n  MGM). In 1980, MGM released, and registered a copyright in, the\n2           PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    film Raging Bull, and it continues to market the film today. Frank\n    Petrella died during the initial copyright term, so renewal rights re-\n    verted to his heirs. Plaintiff below, petitioner here, Paula Petrella\n    (Petrella), his daughter, renewed the 1963 copyright in 1991, becom-\n    ing its sole owner. Seven years later, she advised MGM that its ex-\n    ploitation of Raging Bull violated her copyright and threatened suit.\n    Some nine years later, on January 6, 2009, she filed an infringement\n    suit, seeking monetary and injunctive relief limited to acts of in-\n    fringement occurring on or after January 6, 2006. Invoking the equi-\n    table doctrine of laches, MGM moved for summary judgment. Pet-\n    rella’s 18-year delay in filing suit, MGM argued, was unreasonable\n    and prejudicial to MGM. The District Court granted MGM’s motion,\n    holding that laches barred Petrella’s complaint. The Ninth Circuit\n    affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Laches cannot be invoked as a bar to Petrella’s pursuit of a claim\n for damages brought within §507(b)’s three-year window. Pp. 11–19.\n       (a) By permitting a successful plaintiff to gain retrospective relief\n only three years back from the time of suit, the copyright statute of\n limitations itself takes account of delay. Brought to bear here,\n §507(b) directs that Petrella cannot reach MGM’s returns on its in-\n vestment in Raging Bull in years before 2006. Moreover, if infringe-\n ment within the three-year window is shown, a defendant may offset\n against profits made in that period expenses incurred in generating\n those profits. See §504(b). In addition, a defendant may retain the\n return on investment shown to be attributable to its own enterprise,\n as distinct from the value created by the infringed work. See ibid.\n Both before and after the merger of law and equity in 1938, this\n Court has cautioned against invoking laches to bar legal relief. See,\n e.g., Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 395, 396. Pp. 11–14.\n       (b) MGM’s principal arguments regarding the contemporary\n scope of the laches defense are unavailing. Pp. 14–19.\n         (1) MGM urges that, because laches is listed in Federal Rule of\n Civil Procedure 8(c) as an affirmative defense discrete from a statute\n of limitations defense, the plea should be “available . . . in every civil\n action” to bar all forms of relief. Such an expansive role careens\n away from understandings, past and present, of the essentially gap-\n filling, not legislation-overriding, office of laches. This Court has\n never applied laches to bar in their entirety claims for discrete\n wrongs occurring within a federally prescribed limitations period.\n Inviting individual judges to set a time limit other than the one Con-\n gress prescribed would tug against the uniformity Congress sought to\n achieve in enacting §507(b). Pp. 14–15.\n         (2) MGM contends that laches, like equitable tolling, should be\n                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n“read into every federal statute of limitation,” Holmberg, 327 U. S., at\n397. However, tolling lengthens the time for commencing a civil ac-\ntion where there is a statute of limitations and is, in effect, a rule of\ninterpretation tied to that statutory limit. See, e.g., Young v. United\nStates, 535 U. S. 43, 49–50. In contrast, laches, which originally\nserved as a guide when no statute of limitations controlled, can\nscarcely be described as a rule for interpreting a statutory prescrip-\ntion. Pp. 15–16.\n       (3) MGM insists that the laches defense must be available to\nprevent a copyright owner from sitting still, doing nothing, waiting to\nsee what the outcome of an alleged infringer’s investment will be. It\nis hardly incumbent on copyright owners, however, to challenge each\nand every actionable infringement. And there is nothing untoward\nabout waiting to see whether an infringer’s exploitation undercuts\nthe value of the copyrighted work, has no effect on that work, or even\ncomplements it. Section 507(b)’s limitations period, coupled to the\nseparate-accrual rule, allows a copyright owner to defer suit until she\ncan estimate whether litigation is worth the candle. Pp. 16–17.\n       (4) MGM is concerned that evidence needed or useful to defend\nagainst liability will be lost during a copyright owner’s inaction. But\nCongress must have been aware that the passage of time and the au-\nthor’s death could cause evidentiary issues when it provided for re-\nversionary renewal rights that an author’s heirs can exercise long af-\nter a work was written and copyrighted. Moreover, because a\ncopyright plaintiff bears the burden of proving infringement, any\nhindrance caused by evidence unavailability is as likely to affect\nplaintiffs as defendants. The need for extrinsic evidence is also re-\nduced by the registration mechanism, under which both the certifi-\ncate and the original work must be on file with the Copyright Office\nbefore a copyright owner can sue for infringement. Pp. 17–18.\n       (5) Finally, when a copyright owner engages in intentionally\nmisleading representations concerning his abstention from suit, and\nthe alleged infringer detrimentally relies on such deception, the doc-\ntrine of estoppel may bar the copyright owner’s claims completely,\neliminating all potential remedies. The gravamen of estoppel, a de-\nfense long recognized as available in actions at law, is wrongdoing,\novert misleading, and consequent loss. Estoppel does not undermine\nthe statute of limitations, for it rests on misleading, whether engaged\nin early on, or later in time. P. 19.\n   2. While laches cannot be invoked to preclude adjudication of a\nclaim for damages brought within the Act’s three-year window, in ex-\ntraordinary circumstances, laches may, at the very outset of the liti-\ngation, curtail the relief equitably awarded. For example, where\nowners of a copyrighted architectural design, although aware of an\n4           PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    allegedly infringing housing project, delayed suit until the project\n    was substantially constructed and partially occupied, an order man-\n    dating destruction of the project would not be tolerable. See Chirco v.\n    Crosswinds Communities, Inc., 474 F. 3d 227, 236. Nor, in the face of\n    an unexplained delay in commencing suit, would it be equitable to\n    order “total destruction” of a book already printed, packed, and\n    shipped. See New Era Publications Int’l v. Henry Holt & Co., 873\n    F. 2d 576, 584–585. No such extraordinary circumstance is present\n    here. Petrella notified MGM of her copyright claims before MGM in-\n    vested millions of dollars in creating a new edition of Raging Bull,\n    and the equitable relief she seeks—e.g., disgorgement of unjust gains\n    and an injunction against future infringement—would not result in\n    anything like “total destruction” of the film. Allowing Petrella’s suit\n    to go forward will put at risk only a fraction of the income MGM has\n    earned during the more than three decades Raging Bull has been\n    marketed and will work no unjust hardship on innocent third parties.\n    Should Petrella ultimately prevail on the merits, the District Court,\n    in determining appropriate injunctive relief and assessing profits,\n    may take account of Petrella’s delay in commencing suit.

S. C.\n§507(b). This case presents the question whether the\nequitable defense of laches (unreasonable, prejudicial\ndelay in commencing suit) may bar relief on a copyright\ninfringement claim brought within §507(b)’s three-year\nlimitations period. Section 507(b), it is undisputed, bars\nrelief of any kind for conduct occurring prior to the three-\nyear limitations period. To the extent that an infringe-\nment suit seeks relief solely for conduct occurring within\nthe limitations period, however, courts are not at liberty to\njettison Congress’ judgment on the timeliness of suit.\nLaches, we hold, cannot be invoked to preclude adjudica-\ntion of a claim for damages brought within the three-year\nwindow. As to equitable relief, in extraordinary circum-\nstances, laches may bar at the very threshold the particu-\nlar relief requested by the plaintiff. And a plaintiff ’s delay\ncan always be brought to bear at the remedial stage, in\ndetermining appropriate injunctive relief, and in assessing\n2          PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe “profits of the infringer . . . attributable to the in-\nfringement.” §504(b).1\n   Petitioner Paula Petrella, in her suit for copyright in-\nfringement, sought no relief for conduct occurring outside\n§507(b)’s three-year limitations period. Nevertheless, the\ncourts below held that laches barred her suit in its en-\ntirety, without regard to the currency of the conduct of\nwhich Petrella complains. That position, we hold, is con-\ntrary to §507(b) and this Court’s precedent on the province\nof laches.\n                              I\n  The Copyright Act (Act), 17 U. S. C. §101 et seq., grants\ncopyright protection to original works of authorship.\n§102(a). Four aspects of copyright law bear explanation at\nthe outset.\n  First, the length of a copyright term. Under the Act, a\ncopyright “vests initially in the author or authors of the\nwork,” who may transfer ownership to a third party. §201.\nThe Act confers on a copyright owner certain exclusive\nrights, including the rights to reproduce and distribute the\nwork and to develop and market derivative works. §106.\nCopyrighted works published before 1978—as was the\nwork at issue—are protected for an initial period of 28\nyears, which may be—and in this case was—extended for\na renewal period of up to 67 years. §304(a). From and\nafter January 1, 1978, works are generally protected from\nthe date of creation until 70 years after the author’s death.\n——————\n   1 As infringement remedies, the Copyright Act provides for injunc-\n\ntions, §502, impoundment and disposition of infringing articles, §503,\ndamages and profits, §504, costs and attorney’s fees, §505. Like other\nrestitutional remedies, recovery of profits “is not easily characterized as\nlegal or equitable,” for it is an “amalgamation of rights and remedies\ndrawn from both systems.” Restatement (Third) of Restitution and\nUnjust Enrichment §4, Comment b, p. 28 (2010). Given the “protean\ncharacter” of the profits-recovery remedy, see id., Comment c, at 30, we\nregard as appropriate its treatment as “equitable” in this case.\n                    Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n§302(a).\n   Second, copyright inheritance. For works copyrighted\nunder the pre-1978 regime in which an initial period of\nprotection may be followed by a renewal period, Congress\nprovided that the author’s heirs inherit the renewal rights.\nSee §304(a)(1)(C)(ii)–(iv). We held in Stewart v. Abend,\n495 U. S. 207 (1990), that if an author who has assigned\nher rights away “dies before the renewal period, then the\nassignee may continue to use the original work [to produce\na derivative work] only if the author’s successor transfers\nthe renewal rights to the assignee.” Id., at 221.2\n   Third, remedies. The Act provides a variety of civil\nremedies for infringement, both equitable and legal. See\n§§502–505, described supra, at 2, n. 1. A court may issue\nan injunction “on such terms as it may deem reasonable to\nprevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.” §502(a).\nAt the election of the copyright owner, a court may also\naward either (1) “the copyright owner’s actual damages\nand any additional profits of the infringer,” §504(a)(1),\nwhich petitioner seeks in the instant case, or (2) statutory\ndamages within a defined range, §504(c).\n   Fourth, and most significant here, the statute of limita-\ntions. Until 1957, federal copyright law did not include a\nstatute of limitations for civil suits. Federal courts there-\nfore used analogous state statutes of limitations to deter-\nmine the timeliness of infringement claims. See S. Rep.\nNo. 1014, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1957) (hereinafter\nSenate Report). And they sometimes invoked laches to\nabridge the state-law prescription. As explained in Team-\nsters & Employers Welfare Trust of Ill. v. Gorman Bros.\nReady Mix, 283 F. 3d 877, 881 (CA7 2002): “When Con-\ngress fails to enact a statute of limitations, a [federal]\n——————\n  2 For post-1978 works, heirs still have an opportunity to recapture\n\nrights of the author. See 3 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright\n§11.01[A], p. 11–4 (2013) (hereinafter Nimmer).\n4         PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt that borrows a state statute of limitations but per-\nmits it to be abridged by the doctrine of laches is not in-\nvading congressional prerogatives. It is merely filling a\nlegislative hole.” (internal citation omitted). In 1957,\nCongress addressed the matter and filled the hole; it\nprescribed a three-year look-back limitations period for all\ncivil claims arising under the Copyright Act. See Act of\nSept. 7, 1957, Pub. L. 85–313, 71 Stat. 633, 17 U. S. C.\n§115(b) (1958 ed.). The provision, as already noted, reads:\n“No civil action shall be maintained under the provisions\nof this title unless it is commenced within three years\nafter the claim accrued.” §507(b).3\n  The federal limitations prescription governing copyright\nsuits serves two purposes: (1) to render uniform and cer-\ntain the time within which copyright claims could be\npursued; and (2) to prevent the forum shopping invited by\ndisparate state limitations periods, which ranged from one\nto eight years. Senate Report 2; see H. R. Rep. No. 2419,\n84th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1956). To comprehend how the\nCopyright Act’s limitations period works, one must under-\nstand when a copyright infringement claim accrues.\n  A claim ordinarily accrues “when [a] plaintiff has a\ncomplete and present cause of action.” Bay Area Laundry\nand Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of\nCal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In other words, the limitations period generally\nbegins to run at the point when “the plaintiff can file suit\nand obtain relief.” Ibid. A copyright claim thus arises or\n“accrue[s]” when an infringing act occurs.4\n——————\n  3 The Copyright Act was pervasively revised in 1976, but the three-\n\nyear look-back statute of limitations has remained materially un-\nchanged. See Act of Oct. 19, 1976, §101, 90 Stat. 2586.\n  4 Although we have not passed on the question, nine Courts of Ap-\n\npeals have adopted, as an alternative to the incident of injury rule, a\n“discovery rule,” which starts the limitations period when “the plaintiff\ndiscovers, or with due diligence should have discovered, the injury that\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                       5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   It is widely recognized that the separate-accrual rule\nattends the copyright statute of limitations.5 Under that\nrule, when a defendant commits successive violations, the\nstatute of limitations runs separately from each violation.\nEach time an infringing work is reproduced or distributed,\nthe infringer commits a new wrong. Each wrong gives rise\nto a discrete “claim” that “accrue[s]” at the time the wrong\noccurs.6 In short, each infringing act starts a new limita-\ntions period. See Stone v. Williams, 970 F. 2d 1043, 1049\n(CA2 1992) (“Each act of infringement is a distinct harm\ngiving rise to an independent claim for relief.”).\n   Under the Act’s three-year provision, an infringement is\nactionable within three years, and only three years, of its\noccurrence. And the infringer is insulated from liability\nfor earlier infringements of the same work. See 3 M.\nNimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright §12.05[B][1][b], p. 12–\n150.4 (2013) (“If infringement occurred within three years\nprior to filing, the action will not be barred even if prior\n——————\nforms the basis for the claim.” William A. Graham Co. v. Haughey, 568\nF. 3d 425, 433 (CA3 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also\n6 W. Patry, Copyright §20:19, p. 20–28 (2013) (hereinafter Patry) (“The\noverwhelming majority of courts use discovery accrual in copyright\ncases.”).\n   5 See generally id., §20:23, at 20–44; 3 Nimmer §12.05[B][1][b], at 12–\n\n150.2 to 12–150.4. See also, e.g., William A. Graham Co., 568 F. 3d, at\n433; Peter Letterese & Assoc., Inc. v. World Inst. of Scientology Enter-\nprises, Int’l, 533 F. 3d 1287, 1320, n. 39 (CA11 2008); Bridgeport Music,\nInc. v. Rhyme Syndicate Music, 376 F. 3d 615, 621 (CA6 2004); Mak-\nedwde Publishing Co. v. Johnson, 37 F. 3d 180, 182 (CA5 1994); Roley\nv. New World Pictures, Ltd., 19 F. 3d 479, 481 (CA9 1994).\n   6 Separately accruing harm should not be confused with harm from\n\npast violations that are continuing. Compare Klehr v. A. O. Smith\nCorp., 521 U. S. 179, 190 (1997) (for separately accruing harm, each\nnew act must cause “harm [to the plaintiff] over and above the harm\nthat the earlier acts caused”), with Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman,\n455 U. S. 363, 380–381 (1982) (“[W]here a plaintiff . . . challenges . . . an\nunlawful practice that continues into the limitations period, the com-\nplaint is timely when it is filed within [the limitations period, measured\nfrom] the last asserted occurrence of that practice.” (footnote omitted)).\n6          PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\ninfringements by the same party as to the same work are\nbarred because they occurred more than three years pre-\nviously.”). Thus, when a defendant has engaged (or is\nalleged to have engaged) in a series of discrete infringing\nacts, the copyright holder’s suit ordinarily will be timely\nunder §507(b) with respect to more recent acts of in-\nfringement (i.e., acts within the three-year window), but\nuntimely with respect to prior acts of the same or similar\nkind.7\n   In sum, Congress provided two controlling time pre-\nscriptions: the copyright term, which endures for decades,\nand may pass from one generation to another; and\n§507(b)’s limitations period, which allows plaintiffs during\nthat lengthy term to gain retrospective relief running only\n——————\n    7Acase arising outside of the copyright context is illustrative. In Bay\nArea Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of\nCal., 522 U. S. 192 (1997), an employer was delinquent in making a\nseries of scheduled payments to an underfunded pension plan. See id.,\nat 198–199. The trustees filed suit just over six years after the first\nmissed payment, barely outside of the applicable six-year statute of\nlimitations. See id., at 198. Because the first missed payment in the\nseries fell outside the statute of limitations, the employer argued that\nthe subsequent missed payments were also time barred. See id., at\n206. We rejected that argument. The remaining claims were timely,\nwe held, because “each missed payment create[d] a separate cause of\naction with its own six-year limitations period.” Ibid. Cf. Klehr, 521\nU. S., at 190 (for civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\nAct claims, plaintiff may recover for acts occurring within the limita-\ntions period, but may not use an “independent, new predicate act as a\nbootstrap to recover for injuries caused by other earlier predicate acts\nthat took place outside the limitations period”); National Railroad\nPassenger Corporation v.

After retiring from the\nring, LaMotta worked with his longtime friend, Frank\nPetrella, to tell the story of the boxer’s career. Their\nventure resulted in three copyrighted works: two screen-\nplays, one registered in 1963, the other in 1973, and a\nbook, registered in 1970. This case centers on the screen-\nplay registered in 1963. The registration identified Frank\nPetrella as sole author, but also stated that the screenplay\nwas written “in collaboration with” LaMotta. App. 164.\n   In 1976, Frank Petrella and LaMotta assigned their\nrights in the three works, including renewal rights, to\nChartoff-Winkler Productions, Inc. Two years later, re-\nspondent United Artists Corporation, a subsidiary of respond-\nent Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (collectively, MGM), ac-\nquired the motion picture rights to the book and both\nscreenplays, rights stated by the parties to be “exclusiv[e]\nand forever, including all periods of copyright and renew-\nals and extensions thereof.” Id., at 49. In 1980, MGM\nreleased, and registered a copyright in, the film Raging\nBull, directed by Martin Scorcese and starring Robert De\nNiro, who won a Best Actor Academy Award for his por-\ntrayal of LaMotta. MGM continues to market the film,\nand has converted it into formats unimagined in 1980,\nincluding DVD and Blu-ray.\n   Frank Petrella died in 1981, during the initial terms of\nthe copyrights in the screenplays and book. As this\nCourt’s decision in Stewart confirmed, Frank Petrella’s\nrenewal rights reverted to his heirs, who could renew the\ncopyrights unburdened by any assignment previously\nmade by the author. See 495 U. S., at 220–221 (relying on\n8            PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt’s earlier decision in Miller Music Corp. v. Charles N.\nDaniels, Inc., 362 U. S. 373 (1960)).\n  Plaintiff below, petitioner here, Paula Petrella (Petrella)\nis Frank Petrella’s daughter. Learning of this Court’s\ndecision in Stewart, Petrella engaged an attorney who, in\n1991, renewed the copyright in the 1963 screenplay.\nBecause the copyrights in the 1973 screenplay and the\n1970 book were not timely renewed, the infringement\nclaims in this case rest exclusively on the screenplay\nregistered in 1963. Petrella is now sole owner of the copy-\nright in that work.8\n  In 1998, seven years after filing for renewal of the copy-\nright in the 1963 screenplay, Petrella’s attorney informed\nMGM that Petrella had obtained the copyright to that\nscreenplay. Exploitation of any derivative work, including\nRaging Bull, the attorney asserted, infringed on the copy-\nright now vested in Petrella. During the next two years,\ncounsel for Petrella and MGM exchanged letters in which\nMGM denied the validity of the infringement claims, and\nPetrella repeatedly threatened to take legal action.\n                             B\n   Some nine years later, on January 6, 2009, Petrella filed\na copyright infringement suit in the United States District\nCourt for the Central District of California. She alleged\nthat MGM violated and continued to violate her copyright\nin the 1963 screenplay by using, producing, and distrib-\nuting Raging Bull, a work she described as derivative of\nthe 1963 screenplay. Petrella’s complaint sought mone-\ntary and injunctive relief. Because the statute of limita-\ntions for copyright claims requires commencement of suit\n“within three years after the claim accrued,” §507(b),\n——————\n    8 Petrella’s\n              attorney filed the renewal application on behalf of Frank\nPetrella’s heirs. When Petrella’s mother died and her brother assigned\nhis rights to her, Petrella became the sole owner of all rights in the\n1963 screenplay.\n                    Cite as: 572 U.

No relief, she recognizes,\ncan be awarded for infringing acts prior to that date.\n   MGM moved for summary judgment on several grounds,\namong them, the equitable doctrine of laches. Petrella’s\n18-year delay, from the 1991 renewal of the copyright on\nwhich she relied, until 2009, when she commenced suit,\nMGM maintained, was unreasonable and prejudicial to\nMGM. See Memorandum of Points and Authorities in\nSupport of Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment in\nNo. CV 09–0072 (CD Cal.).\n   The District Court granted MGM’s motion. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 28a–48a. As to the merits of the infringe-\nment claims, the court found, disputed issues of material\nfact precluded summary adjudication. See id., at 34a–42a.\nEven so, the court held, laches barred Petrella’s complaint.\nId., at 42a–48a. Petrella had unreasonably delayed suit\nby not filing until 2009, the court concluded, and further\ndetermined that MGM was prejudiced by the delay. Id., at\n42a–46a. In particular, the court stated, MGM had shown\n“expectations-based prejudice,” because the company had\n“made significant investments in exploiting the film”; in\naddition, the court accepted that MGM would encounter\n“evidentiary prejudice,” because Frank Petrella had died\nand LaMotta, then aged 88, appeared to have sustained a\nloss of memory. Id., at 44a–46a.9\n   The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit af-\nfirmed the laches-based dismissal. 695 F. 3d 946 (2012).\nUnder Ninth Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals first\nobserved, “[i]f any part of the alleged wrongful conduct\noccurred outside of the limitations period, courts presume\n\n——————\n  9 LaMotta,the court noted, “ha[d] suffered myriad blows to his head\nas a fighter years ago,” and “no longer recognize[d Petrella], even\nthough he ha[d] known her for forty years.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n45a–46a.\n10         PETRELLA v.

The presumption\nwas applicable here, the court indicated, because “[t]he\nstatute of limitations for copyright claims in civil cases is\nthree years,” ibid. (citing §507(b)), and Petrella was aware\nof her potential claims many years earlier (as was MGM),\nid., at 952. “[T]he true cause of Petrella’s delay,” the court\nsuggested, “was, as [Petrella] admits, that ‘the film hadn’t\nmade money’ [in years she deferred suit].” Id., at 953.10\nAgreeing with the District Court, the Ninth Circuit de-\ntermined that MGM had established expectations-based\nprejudice: the company had made a large investment in\nRaging Bull, believing it had complete ownership and\ncontrol of the film. Id., at 953–954.11\n  Judge Fletcher concurred only because Circuit prece-\ndent obliged him to do so. Id., at 958. Laches in copyright\ncases, he observed, is “entirely a judicial creation,” one\nnotably “in tension with Congress’ [provision of a three-\nyear limitations period].” Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the\nCircuits on the application of the equitable defense of\nlaches to copyright infringement claims brought within\nthe three-year look-back period prescribed by Congress.12\n——————\n   10 In her declaration, Petrella stated that MGM told her in 2001 that\n\nthe film was in “a huge deficit financially,” “would never show a profit,”\nand, for that reason, “MGM would not continue to send [financial]\nstatements [to her].” App. 234.\n   11 The Court of Appeals did not consider whether MGM had also\n\nshown evidentiary prejudice. 695 F. 3d 946, 953 (CA9 2012).\n   12 See Lyons Partnership L.

Profits made in those\nyears remain the defendant’s to keep. Brought to bear\nhere, §507(b) directs that MGM’s returns on its invest-\nment in Raging Bull in years outside the three-year win-\ndow (years before 2006) cannot be reached by Petrella.\nOnly by disregarding that feature of the statute, and the\nseparate-accrual rule attending §507(b), see supra, at 4–5,\ncould the Court of Appeals presume that infringing acts\noccurring before January 6, 2006 bar all relief, monetary\nand injunctive, for infringement occurring on and after\nthat date.

Deseret Book Co., 287 F. 3d 936, 950\n(CA10 2002) (“Rather than deciding copyright cases on the issue of\nlaches, courts should generally defer to the three-year statute of limita-\ntions.”); New Era Publications Int’l v. Henry Holt & Co., 873 F. 2d 576,\n584–585 (CA2 1989) (“severe prejudice, coupled with . . . unconscionable\ndelay . . . mandates denial of . . . injunction for laches and relegation of\n[plaintiff] to its damages remedy”). Cf. post, at 1, 13 (acknowledging\nthat application of laches should be “extraordinary,” confined to “few\nand unusual cases”).\n   13 Assuming Petrella had a winning case on the merits, the Court of\n\nAppeals’ ruling on laches would effectively give MGM a cost-free license\nto exploit Raging Bull throughout the long term of the copyright. The\nvalue to MGM of such a free, compulsory license could exceed by far\nMGM’s expenditures on the film.\n12        PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nprove and offset against profits made in that period “de-\nductible expenses” incurred in generating those profits.\n§504(b). In addition, the defendant may prove and offset\n“elements of profit attributable to factors other than the\ncopyrighted work.” §504(b). The defendant thus may\nretain the return on investment shown to be attributable\nto its own enterprise, as distinct from the value created by\nthe infringed work. See Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pic-\ntures Corp., 309 U. S. 390, 402, 407 (1940) (equitably\napportioning profits to account for independent contribu-\ntions of infringing defendant). See also infra, at 19–22\n(delay in commencing suit as a factor in determining\ncontours of relief appropriately awarded).\n   Last, but hardly least, laches is a defense developed by\ncourts of equity; its principal application was, and re-\nmains, to claims of an equitable cast for which the Legisla-\nture has provided no fixed time limitation. See 1 D.\nDobbs, Law of Remedies §2.4(4), p. 104 (2d ed. 1993) (here-\ninafter Dobbs) (“laches . . . may have originated in equity\nbecause no statute of limitations applied, . . . suggest[ing]\nthat laches should be limited to cases in which no statute\nof limitations applies”). Both before and after the merger\nof law and equity in 1938,14 this Court has cautioned\nagainst invoking laches to bar legal relief. See Holmberg\nv. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 395, 396 (1946) (in actions at\nlaw, “[i]f Congress explicitly puts a limit upon the time for\nenforcing a right which it created, there is an end of the\nmatter,” but “[t]raditionally . . . , statutes of limitation are\nnot controlling measures of equitable relief ”); Merck & Co.\nv. Reynolds, 559 U. S. 633, 652 (2010) (quoting, for its\ncurrent relevance, statement in United States v. Mack,\n295 U. S. 480, 489 (1935), that “[l]aches within the term of\n——————\n  14 See Fed.

S. 226, 244, n. 16 (1985) (“[A]pplication of the\nequitable defense of laches in an action at law would be\nnovel indeed.”).15\n   Because we adhere to the position that, in face of a\nstatute of limitations enacted by Congress, laches cannot\nbe invoked to bar legal relief, the dissent thinks we\n“plac[e] insufficient weight upon the rules and practice of\nmodern litigation.” Post, at 12. True, there has been,\nsince 1938, only “one form of action—the civil action.”\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 2. But “the substantive and remedial\nprinciples [applicable] prior to the advent of the federal\nrules [have] not changed.” 4 C. Wright & A. Miller, Fed-\neral Practice and Procedure §1043, p. 177 (3d ed. 2002).\nHolmberg, Merck, and Oneida so illustrate. The dissent\npresents multiple citations, see post, at 1, 3–4, 7–8, 10–11,\nmany of them far afield from the issue at hand, others\nobscuring what the cited decisions in fact ruled. Compare,\ne.g., post, at 1, 11, with infra, at 20–21 (describing Chirco\n——————\n  15 In contrast to the Copyright Act, the Lanham Act, which governs\ntrademarks, contains no statute of limitations, and expressly provides\nfor defensive use of “equitable principles, including laches.” 15 U. S. C.\n§1115(b)(9). But cf. post, at 8, 11 (citing Hot Wax, Inc. v. Turtle Wax,\nInc., 191 F. 3d 813 (CA7 1999), but failing to observe that Lanham Act\ncontains no statute of limitations).\n   The Patent Act states: “[N]o recovery shall be had for any infringe-\nment committed more than six years prior to the filing of the com-\nplaint.” 35 U. S. C. §286. The Act also provides that “[n]onin-\nfringement, absence of liability for infringement or unenforceability”\nmay be raised “in any action involving the validity or infringement\nof a patent.” §282(b) (2012 ed.). Based in part on §282 and com-\nmentary thereon, legislative history, and historical practice, the Fed-\neral Circuit has held that laches can bar damages incurred prior to\nthe commencement of suit, but not injunctive relief. A. C. Aukerman\nCo. v. R. L. Chaides Constr. Co., 960 F. 2d 1020, 1029–1031, 1039–1041\n(1992) (en banc). We have not had occasion to review the Federal\nCircuit’s position.\n14       PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nv.

S. 101 (2002)); post, at 8, with infra, at 15, n. 16\n(describing Patterson v. Hewitt, 195 U. S. 309 (1904)). Yet\ntellingly, the dissent has come up with no case in which\nthis Court has approved the application of laches to bar a\nclaim for damages brought within the time allowed by a\nfederal statute of limitations. There is nothing at all\n“differen[t],” see post, at 12, about copyright cases in this\nregard.\n                           IV\n  We turn now to MGM’s principal arguments regarding\nthe contemporary scope of the laches defense, all of them\nembraced by the dissent.\n                                A\n   Laches is listed among affirmative defenses, along with,\nbut discrete from, the statute of limitations, in Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 8(c). Accordingly, MGM main-\ntains, the plea is “available . . . in every civil action” to bar\nall forms of relief. Tr. of Oral Arg. 43; see Brief for Re-\nspondents 40. To the Court’s question, could laches apply\nwhere there is an ordinary six-year statute of limitations,\nMGM’s counsel responded yes, case-specific circumstances\nmight warrant a ruling that a suit brought in year five\ncame too late. Tr. of Oral Arg. 52; see id., at 41.\n   The expansive role for laches MGM envisions careens\naway from understandings, past and present, of the essen-\ntially gap-filling, not legislation-overriding, office of laches.\nNothing in this Court’s precedent suggests a doctrine\nof such sweep. Quite the contrary, we have never applied\nlaches to bar in their entirety claims for discrete wrongs\noccurring within a federally prescribed limitations pe-\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nriod.16 Inviting individual judges to set a time limit other\nthan the one Congress prescribed, we note, would tug\nagainst the uniformity Congress sought to achieve when it\nenacted §507(b). See supra, at 3–4.\n                              B\n  MGM observes that equitable tolling “is read into every\nfederal statute of limitation,” Holmberg, 327 U. S., at 397,\nand asks why laches should not be treated similarly. See\nBrief for Respondents 23–26; post, at 7–8. Tolling, which\nlengthens the time for commencing a civil action in appro-\npriate circumstances,17 applies when there is a statute of\n——————\n  16 MGM    pretends otherwise, but the cases on which it relies do not\ncarry the load MGM would put on them. Morgan, described supra, at 6,\nn. 7, is apparently MGM’s best case, for it is cited 13 times in MGM’s\nbrief. See Brief for Respondents 8, 9, 14, 16, 18, 19, 25, 31, 34, 35, 36,\n40, 47; post, at 1, 7, 10–11. Morgan, however, does not so much as hint\nthat laches may bar claims for discrete wrongs, all of them occurring\nwithin a federal limitations period. Part II–A of that opinion, dealing\nwith the separate-accrual rule, held that “[e]ach discrete discriminatory\nact starts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act,” regardless of\nwhether “past acts” are time barred. 536 U. S., at 113. Parts II–B and\nII–C of the opinion then distinguished separately accruing wrongs from\nhostile-work-environment claims, cumulative in effect and extending\nover long periods of time. Id., at 115–117, 121. Laches could be in-\nvoked, the Court reasoned, to limit the continuing violation doctrine’s\npotential to rescue untimely claims, not claims accruing separately\nwithin the limitations period.\n  Bay Area Laundry, described, along with Morgan, supra, at 6, n. 7, is\nsimilarly featured by MGM. See also post, at 7–8, 11. But that opinion\nconsidered laches only in the context of a federal statute calling for\naction “[a]s soon as practicable.” 29 U. S. C. §1399(b)(1); see 522 U. S.,\nat 205. Patterson v. Hewitt, 195 U. S. 309 (1904), described by MGM as\na case resembling Petrella’s, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–33, 53, barred\nequitable claims that were timely under state law. When state law was\nthe reference, federal courts sometimes applied laches as a further\ncontrol. See supra, at 3–4; Russel v. Todd, 309 U. S. 280, 288, n. 1\n(1940) (“Laches may bar equitable remedy before the local statute has\nrun.”). No federal statute of limitations figured in Patterson.\n  17 E.g., a party’s infancy or mental disability, absence of the defend-\n16         PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nlimitations; it is, in effect, a rule of interpretation tied to\nthat limit. See Young v. United States, 535 U. S. 43, 49–\n50 (2002); Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421\nU. S. 454, 464 (1975).18 Laches, in contrast, originally\nserved as a guide when no statute of limitations controlled\nthe claim; it can scarcely be described as a rule for inter-\npreting a statutory prescription. That is so here, because\nthe statute, §507(b), makes the starting trigger an infring-\ning act committed three years back from the commence-\nment of suit, while laches, as conceived by the Ninth\nCircuit and advanced by MGM, makes the presumptive\ntrigger the defendant’s initial infringing act. See 695\nF. 3d, at 951; Brief for United States 16.\n                              C\n  MGM insists that the defense of laches must be avail-\nable to prevent a copyright owner from sitting still, doing\nnothing, waiting to see what the outcome of an alleged\ninfringer’s investment will be. See Brief for Respondents\n48. In this case, MGM stresses, “[Petrella] conceded that\nshe waited to file because ‘the film was deeply in debt and\nin the red and would probably never recoup.’ ” Id., at 47\n(quoting from App. 110). The Ninth Circuit similarly\nfaulted Petrella for waiting to sue until the film Raging\nBull “made money.” 695 F. 3d, at 953 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). See also post, at 3–6 (deploring plaintiffs\nwho wait to see whether the allegedly infringing work\nmakes money).\n  It is hardly incumbent on copyright owners, however, to\nchallenge each and every actionable infringement. And\n——————\nant from the jurisdiction, fraudulent concealment. See S. Rep. No.\n1014, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 2–3 (1957) (hereinafter Senate Report).\n  18 The legislative history to which the dissent refers, post, at 7, speaks\n\nof “equitable situations on which the statute of limitations is generally\nsuspended,” Senate Report 3, and says nothing about laches shrinking\nthe time Congress allowed.\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthere is nothing untoward about waiting to see whether an\ninfringer’s exploitation undercuts the value of the copy-\nrighted work, has no effect on the original work, or even\ncomplements it. Fan sites prompted by a book or film, for\nexample, may benefit the copyright owner. See Wu, Tol-\nerated Use, 31 Colum. J. L. & Arts 617, 619–620 (2008).\nEven if an infringement is harmful, the harm may be too\nsmall to justify the cost of litigation.\n   If the rule were, as MGM urges, “sue soon, or forever\nhold your peace,” copyright owners would have to mount a\nfederal case fast to stop seemingly innocuous infringe-\nments, lest those infringements eventually grow in magni-\ntude. Section 507(b)’s three-year limitations period, how-\never, coupled to the separate-accrual rule, see supra, at\n3–6, avoids such litigation profusion. It allows a copyright\nowner to defer suit until she can estimate whether litiga-\ntion is worth the candle. She will miss out on damages for\nperiods prior to the three-year look-back, but her right to\nprospective injunctive relief should, in most cases, remain\nunaltered.19\n                              D\n  MGM points to the danger that evidence needed or\nuseful to defend against liability will be lost during a\ncopyright owner’s inaction. Brief for Respondents 37–38;\nsee post, at 2–4.20 Recall, however, that Congress provided\nfor reversionary renewal rights exercisable by an author’s\nheirs, rights that can be exercised, at the earliest for pre-\n\n——————\n  19 The  dissent worries that a plaintiff might sue for profits “every\nthree years . . . until the copyright expires.” Post, at 5; see post, at 2.\nThat suggestion neglects to note that a plaintiff who proves infringe-\nment will likely gain forward-looking injunctive relief stopping the\ndefendant’s repetition of infringing acts.\n  20 As earlier noted, see supra, at 10, n. 11, the Court of Appeals did\n\nnot reach the question whether evidentiary prejudice existed. 695\nF. 3d, at 953.\n18       PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1978 copyrights, 28 years after a work was written and\ncopyrighted. See, supra, at 2–3. At that time, the author,\nand perhaps other witnesses to the creation of the work,\nwill be dead. See supra, at 7. Congress must have been\naware that the passage of time and the author’s death\ncould cause a loss or dilution of evidence. Congress chose,\nnonetheless, to give the author’s family “a second chance\nto obtain fair remuneration.” Stewart, 495 U. S., at 220.\n   Moreover, a copyright plaintiff bears the burden of\nproving infringement. See 3 W. Patry, Copyright §9.4,\np. 9–18 (2013) (hereinafter Patry) (“As in other civil litiga-\ntion, a copyright owner bears the burden of establishing a\nprima facie case.”). But cf. post, at 4 (overlooking plain-\ntiff ’s burden to show infringement and the absence of any\nburden upon the defendant “to prove that it did not in-\nfringe”). Any hindrance caused by the unavailability of\nevidence, therefore, is at least as likely to affect plaintiffs\nas it is to disadvantage defendants. That is so in cases of\nthe kind Petrella is pursuing, for a deceased author most\nprobably would have supported his heir’s claim.\n   The registration mechanism, we further note, reduces\nthe need for extrinsic evidence. Although registration is\n“permissive,” both the certificate and the original work\nmust be on file with the Copyright Office before a copy-\nright owner can sue for infringement. §§408(b), 411(a).\nKey evidence in the litigation, then, will be the certificate,\nthe original work, and the allegedly infringing work. And\nthe adjudication will often turn on the factfinder’s direct\ncomparison of the original and the infringing works, i.e.,\non the factfinder’s “good eyes and common sense” in com-\nparing the two works’ “total concept and overall feel.”\nPeter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. Simone Development\nCorp., 602 F. 3d 57, 66 (CA2 2010) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n                     Cite as: 572 U.

See 6 Patry §20:58, at 20–\n110 to 20–112.21 The test for estoppel is more exacting\nthan the test for laches, and the two defenses are differ-\nently oriented. The gravamen of estoppel, a defense long\nrecognized as available in actions at law, see Wehrman v.\nConklin, 155 U. S. 314, 327 (1894), is misleading and\nconsequent loss, see 6 Patry §20:58, at 20–110 to 20–112.\nDelay may be involved, but is not an element of the de-\nfense. For laches, timeliness is the essential element. In\ncontrast to laches, urged by MGM entirely to override the\nstatute of limitations Congress prescribed, estoppel does\nnot undermine Congress’ prescription, for it rests on mis-\nleading, whether engaged in early on, or later in time.\n  Stating that the Ninth Circuit “ha[d] taken a wrong\nturn in its formulation and application of laches in copy-\nright cases,” Judge Fletcher called for fresh consideration\nof the issue. 695 F. 3d, at 959. “A recognition of the dis-\ntinction between . . . estoppel and laches,” he suggested,\n“would be a good place to start.” Ibid. We agree.\n                            V\n  The courts below summarily disposed of Petrella’s case\nbased on laches, preventing adjudication of any of her\nclaims on the merits and foreclosing the possibility of any\nform of relief. That disposition, we have explained, was\nerroneous. Congress’ time provisions secured to authors a\n——————\n  21 Although  MGM, in its answer to Petrella’s complaint, separately\nraised both laches and estoppel as affirmative defenses, see Defendants’\nAnswer to Plaintiff’s Complaint in No. CV 09–0072 (CD Cal.), the\ncourts below did not address the estoppel plea.\n20      PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncopyright term of long duration, and a right to sue for\ninfringement occurring no more than three years back\nfrom the time of suit. That regime leaves “little place” for\na doctrine that would further limit the timeliness of a\ncopyright owner’s suit. See 1 Dobbs §2.6(1), at 152. In\nextraordinary circumstances, however, the consequences\nof a delay in commencing suit may be of sufficient magni-\ntude to warrant, at the very outset of the litigation, cur-\ntailment of the relief equitably awardable.\n   Chirco v. Crosswinds Communities, Inc., 474 F. 3d 227\n(CA6 2007), is illustrative. In that case, the defendants\nwere alleged to have used without permission, in planning\nand building a housing development, the plaintiffs’ copy-\nrighted architectural design. Long aware of the defend-\nants’ project, the plaintiffs took no steps to halt the hous-\ning development until more than 168 units were built, 109\nof which were occupied. Id., at 230. Although the action\nwas filed within §507(b)’s three-year statute of limitations,\nthe District Court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants, dismissing the entire case on grounds of laches.\nThe trial court’s rejection of the entire suit could not\nstand, the Court of Appeals explained, for it was not within\nthe Judiciary’s ken to debate the wisdom of §507(b)’s\nthree-year look-back prescription. Id., at 235. Neverthe-\nless, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s\njudgment to this extent: The plaintiffs, even if they might\nsucceed in proving infringement of their copyrighted de-\nsign, would not be entitled to an order mandating destruc-\ntion of the housing project. That relief would be inequit-\nable, the Sixth Circuit held, for two reasons: the plaintiffs\nknew of the defendants’ construction plans before the de-\nfendants broke ground, yet failed to take readily available\nmeasures to stop the project; and the requested relief\nwould “work an unjust hardship” upon the defendants and\ninnocent third parties. Id., at 236. See also New Era\nPublications Int’l v. Henry Holt & Co., 873 F. 2d 576, 584–\n                 Cite as: 572 U.

Petrella notified MGM of her copyright\nclaims before MGM invested millions of dollars in creating\na new edition of Raging Bull. And the equitable relief\nPetrella seeks—e.g., disgorgement of unjust gains and an\ninjunction against future infringement—would not result\nin “total destruction” of the film, or anything close to it.\nSee New Era, 873 F. 2d, at 584. MGM released Raging\nBull more than three decades ago and has marketed it\ncontinuously since then. Allowing Petrella’s suit to go\nforward will put at risk only a fraction of the income MGM\nhas earned during that period and will work no unjust\nhardship on innocent third parties, such as consumers\nwho have purchased copies of Raging Bull. Cf. Chirco, 474\nF. 3d, at 235–236 (destruction remedy would have ousted\nfamilies from recently purchased homes). The circum-\nstances here may or may not (we need not decide) warrant\nlimiting relief at the remedial stage, but they are not\nsufficiently extraordinary to justify threshold dismissal.\n   Should Petrella ultimately prevail on the merits, the\nDistrict Court, in determining appropriate injunctive relief\nand assessing profits, may take account of her delay in\ncommencing suit. See supra, at 1–2, 11–12. In doing so,\nhowever, that court should closely examine MGM’s alleged\n22        PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nreliance on Petrella’s delay.22 This examination should\ntake account of MGM’s early knowledge of Petrella’s\nclaims, the protection MGM might have achieved through\npursuit of a declaratory judgment action, the extent to\nwhich MGM’s investment was protected by the separate-\naccrual rule, the court’s authority to order injunctive relief\n“on such terms as it may deem reasonable,” §502(a), and\nany other considerations that would justify adjusting\ninjunctive relief or profits. See Haas v.

Ross\ntransl. L. Brown ed. 2009). Laches is one such equitable\ndoctrine. It applies in those extraordinary cases where the\nplaintiff “unreasonably delays in filing a suit,” National\nRailroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101,\n121 (2002), and, as a result, causes “unjust hardship” to\nthe defendant, Chirco v. Crosswinds Communities, Inc.,\n474 F. 3d 227, 236 (CA6 2007) (emphasis deleted). Its\npurpose is to avoid “inequity.” Galliher v. Cadwell, 145\nU. S. 368, 373 (1892). And, as Learned Hand pointed out,\nit may well be\n    “inequitable for the owner of a copyright, with full no-\n    tice of an intended infringement, to stand inactive\n    while the proposed infringer spends large sums of\n    money in its exploitation, and to intervene only when\n    his speculation has proved a success.” Haas v. Leo\n    Feist, Inc., 234 F. 105, 108 (SDNY 1916).\n2        PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nToday’s decision disables federal courts from addressing\nthat inequity. I respectfully dissent.\n                               I\n   Circumstances warranting the application of laches in\nthe context of copyright claims are not difficult to imagine.\nThe 3-year limitations period under the Copyright Act\nmay seem brief, but it is not. 17 U. S. C. §507(b). That is\nbecause it is a rolling limitations period, which restarts\nupon each “separate accrual” of a claim. See ante, at 5; 6\nW. Patry, Copyright §20:23, pp. 20–44 to 20–46 (2013). If\na defendant reproduces or sells an infringing work on a\ncontinuing basis, a plaintiff can sue every 3 years until the\ncopyright term expires—which may be up to 70 years after\nthe author’s death. §302(a) (works created after January\n1, 1978, are protected until 70 years after the author’s\ndeath); §304(a) (works created before January 1, 1978, are\nprotected for 28 years plus a 67-year renewal period). If,\nfor example, a work earns no money for 20 years, but then,\nafter development expenses have been incurred, it earns\nprofits for the next 30, a plaintiff can sue in year 21 and at\nregular 3-year intervals thereafter. Each time the plain-\ntiff will collect the defendant’s profits earned during the\nprior three years, unless he settles for a lump sum along\nthe way. The defendant will recoup no more than his\noutlays and any “elements of profit attributable to factors\nother than the copyrighted work.” §§504(a)(1), (b).\n   A 20-year delay in bringing suit could easily prove\ninequitable. Suppose, for example, the plaintiff has delib-\nerately waited for the death of witnesses who might prove\nthe existence of understandings about a license to repro-\nduce the copyrighted work, or who might show that the\nplaintiff ’s work was in fact derived from older copyrighted\nmaterials that the defendant has licensed. Or, suppose\nthe plaintiff has delayed in bringing suit because he wants\nto avoid bargaining with the defendant up front over a\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlicense. He knows that if he delays legal action, and the\ndefendant invests time, effort, and resources into making\nthe derivative product, the plaintiff will be in a much\nstronger position to obtain favorable licensing terms\nthrough settlement. Or, suppose the plaintiff has waited\nuntil he becomes certain that the defendant’s production\nbet paid off, that the derivative work did and would con-\ntinue to earn money, and that the plaintiff has a chance of\nobtaining, say, an 80% share of what is now a 90% pure\nprofit stream. (N. B. The plaintiff ’s profits recovery will\nbe reduced by any “deductible expenses” incurred by the\ndefendant in producing the work, and by any “elements of\nprofits attributable to factors other than the copyrighted\nwork,” §504(b)). Or, suppose that all of these circumstances\nexist together.\n   Cases that present these kinds of delays are not imagi-\nnary. One can easily find examples from the lower courts\nwhere plaintiffs have brought claims years after they\naccrued and where delay-related inequity resulted. See,\ne.g., Ory v. McDonald, 141 Fed. Appx. 581, 583 (CA9\n2005), aff ’g 2003 WL 22909286, *1 (CD Cal., Aug. 5, 2003)\n(claim that a 1960’s song infringed the “hook or riff ” from\nthe 1926 song “Muskrat Ramble,” brought more than 30\nyears after the song was released); Danjaq LLC v. Sony\nCorp., 263 F. 3d 942, 952–956 (CA9 2001) (claim that\nseven James Bond films infringed a copyright to a screen-\nplay, brought 19 to 36 years after the films were released,\nand where “many of the key figures in the creation of the\nJames Bond movies ha[d] died” and “many of the relevant\nrecords [went] missing”); Jackson v. Axton, 25 F. 3d 884,\n889 (CA9 1994), overruled on other grounds, 510 U. S. 517\n(claim of coauthorship of the song “Joy to the World,”\nbrought 17 years after the plaintiff learned of his claim\nsuch that memories faded, the original paper containing\nthe lyrics was lost, the recording studio (with its records)\nclosed, and the defendant had “arranged his business\n4       PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\naffairs around the Song” for years); Newsome v. Brown,\n2005 WL 627639, *8–*9 (SDNY, Mar. 16, 2005) (claim\nregarding the song “It’s a Man’s World,” brought 40 years\nafter first accrual, where the plaintiff ’s memory had faded\nand a key piece of evidence was destroyed by fire). See\nalso Chirco, 474 F. 3d, at 230–231, 234–236 (claim that\ncondominium design infringed plaintiff ’s design, brought\nonly 2.5 years (or so) after claim accrued but after condo-\nminium was built, apartments were sold, and 109 families\nhad moved in).\n   Consider, too, the present case. The petitioner claims\nthe MGM film Raging Bull violated a copyright originally\nowned by her father, which she inherited and then re-\nnewed in 1991. She waited 18 years after renewing the\ncopyright, until 2009, to bring suit. During those 18 years,\nMGM spent millions of dollars developing different edi-\ntions of, and marketing, the film. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 13a. MGM also entered into numerous licensing\nagreements, some of which allowed television networks to\nbroadcast the film through 2015. Id., at 14a. Meanwhile,\nthree key witness died or became unavailable, making it\nmore difficult for MGM to prove that it did not infringe the\npetitioner’s copyright (either because the 1963 screenplay\nwas in fact derived from a different book, the rights to\nwhich MGM owned under a nonchallenged license, or\nbecause MGM held a license to the screenplay under a\n1976 agreement that it signed with Jake LaMotta, who\ncoauthored the screenplay with the petitioner’s father, see\nid. at 3a, 5a; App. 128–129, 257–258, 266–267). Conse-\nquently, I believe the Court of Appeals acted lawfully in\ndismissing the suit due to laches.\n   Long delays do not automatically prove inequity, but,\ndepending upon the circumstances, they raise that possi-\nbility. Indeed, suppose that that the copyright-holders in\nthe song cases cited above, or their heirs, facing sudden\nrevivals in demand or eventual deaths of witnesses, had\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nbrought their claims 50, or even 60 years after those\nclaims first accrued. Or suppose that the loss of evidence\nwas clearly critical to the defendants’ abilities to prove\ntheir cases. The Court holds that insofar as a copyright\nclaim seeks damages, a court cannot ever apply laches,\nirrespective of the length of the plaintiff ’s delay, the\namount of the harm that it caused, or the inequity of\npermitting the action to go forward.\n                                II\n   Why should laches not be available in an appropriate\ncase? Consider the reasons the majority offers. First, the\nmajority says that the 3-year “copyright statute of limita-\ntions . . . itself takes account of delay,” and so additional\nsafeguards like laches are not needed. Ante, at 11. I agree\nthat sometimes that is so. But I also fear that sometimes\nit is not. The majority correctly points out that the limita-\ntions period limits the retrospective relief a plaintiff can\nrecover. It imposes a cap equal to the profits earned dur-\ning the prior three years, in addition to any actual damages\nsustained during this time. Ibid.; §504(b). Thus, if the\nplaintiff waits from, say, 1980 until 2001 to bring suit, she\ncannot recover profits for the 1980 to 1998 period. But she\ncan recover the defendant’s profits from 1998 through\n2001, which might be precisely when net revenues turned\npositive. And she can sue every three years thereafter\nuntil the copyright expires, perhaps in the year 2060. If\nthe plaintiff ’s suit involves the type of inequitable circum-\nstances I have described, her ability to recover profits from\n1998 to 2001 and until the copyright expires could be just\nthe kind of unfairness that laches is designed to prevent.\n   Second, the majority points out that the plaintiff can\nrecover only the defendant’s profits less “ ‘deductible ex-\npenses’ incurred in generating those profits.” Ante, at 12\n(quoting §504(b)). In other words, the majority takes\nassurance from the fact that the Act enables the defendant\n6       PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto recoup his outlays in developing or selling the allegedly\ninfringing work. Again, sometimes that fact will prevent\ninequitable results. But sometimes it will not. A plain-\ntiff ’s delay may mean that the defendant has already\nrecovered the majority of his expenses, and what is left is\nprimarily profit. It may mean that the defendant has\ndedicated decades of his life to producing the work, such\nthat the loss of a future profit stream (even if he can re-\ncover past expenses) is tantamount to the loss of any\nincome in later years. And in circumstances such as those\ndescribed, it could prove inequitable to give the profit to a\nplaintiff who has unnecessarily delayed in filing an action.\nSimply put, the “deductible expenses” provision does not\nprotect the defendant from the potential inequity high-\nlighted by Judge Hand nearly 100 years ago in his influ-\nential copyright opinion. That is, it does not stop a\ncopyright-holder (or his heirs) from “stand[ing] inactive\nwhile the proposed infringer spends large sums of money”\nin a risky venture; appearing on the scene only when the\nventure has proved a success; and thereby collecting sub-\nstantially more money than he could have obtained at the\noutset, had he bargained with the investor over a license\nand royalty fee. Haas, 234 F., at 108. But cf. id., at 108–\n109 (plaintiff to receive injunctive relief since one of the\ndefendants was a “deliberate pirate,” but profit award to\nbe potentially reduced in light of laches).\n   Third, the majority says that “[i]nviting individual\njudges to set a time limit other than the one Congress\nprescribed” in the Copyright Act would “tug against the\nuniformity Congress sought to achieve when it enacted\n§507(b).” Ante, at 15. But why does the majority believe\nthat part of what Congress intended to “achieve” was the\nelimination of the equitable defense of laches? As the\nmajority recognizes, Congress enacted a uniform statute of\nlimitations for copyright claims in 1957 so that federal\ncourts, in determining timeliness, no longer had to borrow\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfrom state law which varied from place to place. See ante,\nat 3–4. Nothing in the 1957 Act—or anywhere else in the\ntext of the copyright statute—indicates that Congress also\nsought to bar the operation of laches. The Copyright Act\nis silent on the subject. And silence is consistent, not\ninconsistent, with the application of equitable doctrines.\n   For one thing, the legislative history for §507 shows that\nCongress chose not to “specifically enumerat[e] certain\nequitable considerations which might be advanced in\nconnection with civil copyright actions” because it under-\nstood that “ ‘[f]ederal district courts, generally, recognize\nthese equitable defenses anyway.’ ” S. Rep. No. 1014, 85th\nCong., 1st Sess., 2–3 (1957) (quoting the House Judiciary\nCommittee). Courts prior to 1957 had often applied laches\nin federal copyright cases. See, e.g., Callaghan v. Myers,\n128 U. S. 617, 658–659 (1888) (assuming laches was an\navailable defense in a copyright suit); Edwin L. Wiegand\nCo. v. Harold E. Trent Co., 122 F. 2d 920, 925 (CA3 1941)\n(applying laches to bar a copyright suit); D. O. Haynes &\nCo. v. Druggists’ Circular, 32 F. 2d 215, 216–218 (CA2\n1929) (same). Congress expected they would continue to\ndo so.\n   Furthermore, this Court has held that federal courts\nmay “appl[y] equitable doctrines that may toll or limit the\ntime period” for suit when applying a statute of limita-\ntions, because a statutory “filing period” is a “requirement”\nsubject to adjustment “ ‘when equity so requires.’ ” Mor-\ngan, 536 U. S., at 121–122 (quoting Zipes v. Trans World\nAirlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 398 (1982); emphasis added).\nThis Court has read laches into statutes of limitations\notherwise silent on the topic of equitable doctrines in a\nmultitude of contexts, as have lower courts. See, e.g.,\nMorgan, supra, at 121 (“an employer may raise a laches\ndefense” under Title VII); Bay Area Laundry and Dry\nCleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522\nU. S. 192, 205 (1997) (similar, in respect to suits under the\n8        PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nMultiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980\n(MPPAA)); Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136,\n155 (1967) (similar, in respect to an action for declaratory\nand injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure\nAct); Patterson v. Hewitt, 195 U. S. 309, 319–320 (1904)\n(similar, in the case of a property action brought within\nNew Mexico’s statute of limitations); Alsop v. Riker, 155\nU. S. 448, 460 (1894) (holding that “independently of the\nstatute of limitations,” the contract action was barred\n“because of laches”); Teamsters & Employers Welfare Trust\nof Ill. v. Gorman Bros. Ready Mix, 283 F. 3d 877, 883 (CA7\n2002) (laches available “in a suit against an [Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974] (ERISA)] plan for\nbenefits”); Hot Wax, Inc. v. Turtle Wax, Inc., 191 F. 3d 813,\n822–823 (CA7 1999) (laches available in a Lanham Act\nsuit filed within the limitations period). Unless Congress\nindicates otherwise, courts normally assume that equita-\nble rules continue to operate alongside limitations periods,\nand that equity applies both to plaintiffs and to defend-\nants. See Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501\nU. S. 104, 108 (1991) (“Congress is understood to legislate\nagainst a background of common-law adjudicatory princi-\nples” and to incorporate them “except when a statutory\npurpose to the contrary is evident” (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted)); Porter v. Warner Holding\nCo., 328 U. S. 395, 398 (1946) (“Unless otherwise provided\nby statute, all the inherent equitable powers of the Dis-\ntrict Court are available for the proper and complete\nexercise of that jurisdiction”).\n   The Court today comes to a different conclusion. It\nreads §507(b)’s silence as preserving doctrines that\nlengthen the period for suit when equitable considerations\nfavor the plaintiff (e.g., equitable tolling), but as foreclos-\ning a doctrine that would shorten the period when equity\nfavors the defendant (i.e., laches). See ante, at 15–16, 19–\n20. I do not understand the logic of reading a silent stat-\n                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nute in this manner.\n  Fourth, the majority defends its rule by observing that\nlaches was “developed by courts of equity,” and that this\nCourt has “cautioned against invoking laches to bar legal\nrelief ” even following the merger of law and equity in\n1938. Ante, at 12–13. The majority refers to three cases\nthat offer support for this proposition, but none is deter-\nminative. In the first, Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S.\n392 (1946), the Court said:\n    “If Congress explicitly puts a limit upon the time for\n    enforcing a right which it created, there is an end of\n    the matter.\n      .           .          .           .           .\n    “Traditionally and for good reasons, statutes of limita-\n    tion are not controlling measures of equitable relief.”\n    Id., at 395–396.\nThis statement, however, constituted part of the Court’s\nexplanation as to why a federal statute, silent about limi-\ntations, should be applied consistently with “historic prin-\nciples of equity in the enforcement of federally-created\nequitable rights” rather than with New York’s statute of\nlimitations. Id., at 395. The case had nothing to do with\nwhether laches governs in actions at law. The lawsuit in\nHolmberg had been brought “in equity,” and the Court\nremanded for a determination of whether the petitioners\nwere “chargeable with laches.” Id., at 393, 397.\n  The second case the majority cites, Merck & Co. v. Reyn-\nolds, 559 U. S. 633 (2010), provides some additional sup-\nport, but not much. There, the Court cited a 1935 case for\nthe proposition that “ ‘[l]aches within the term of the stat-\nute of limitations is no defense at law.’ ” Id., at 652 (quot-\ning United States v. Mack, 295 U. S. 480, 489 (1935)). But\nMerck concerned a federal securities statute that con-\ntained both a 2-year statute of limitations, running from\nthe time of “discovery,” and a 5-year statute of repose,\n10      PETRELLA v. METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrunning from the time of a “violation.” Id., at 638 (citing\n28 U. S. C. §1658(b)). Given that repose statutes set “an\noutside limit” on suit and are generally “inconsistent with\ntolling” and similar equitable doctrines, the Court held\nthat the 2-year limitations period at issue was not subject\nto an “inquiry notice” rule or, by analogy, to laches. Lampf,\nPleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S.\n350, 363 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted); Merck, supra, at 650–652. Merck did not suggest\nthat statutes of limitations are always or normally incon-\nsistent with equitable doctrines when plaintiffs seek dam-\nages. It simply found additional support for its conclusion\nin a case that this Court decided before the merger of law\nand equity. And here, unlike in Merck, the statute of\nlimitations is not accompanied by a corollary statute of\nrepose.\n   Third, in County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of\nN. Y., 470 U. S. 226 (1985), the Court said in a footnote\nthat “application of the equitable defense of laches in an\naction at law would be novel indeed.” Id., at 245, n. 16.\nThis statement was made in light of special policies re-\nlated to Indian tribes, which the Court went on to discuss in\nthe following sentences. Ibid. In any event, Oneida did\nnot resolve whether laches was available to the defend-\nants, for the lower court had not ruled on the issue. Id., at\n244–245.\n   In sum, there is no reason to believe that the Court\nmeant any of its statements in Holmberg, Merck, or Oneida\nto announce a general rule about the availability of\nlaches in actions for legal relief, whenever Congress pro-\nvides a statute of limitations. To the contrary, the Court\nhas said more than once that a defendant could invoke\nlaches in an action for damages (even though no assertion\nof the defense had actually been made in the case), despite\na fixed statute of limitations. See Morgan, 536 U. S., at\n116–119, 121–122 (laches available in hostile work envi-\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

S., at 205 (laches available in ac-\ntions for “withdrawal liability assessment[s]” under the\nMPPAA). Lower courts have come to similar holdings in a\nwide array of circumstances—often approving not only of\nthe availability of the laches defense, but of its application\nto the case at hand. E.g., Cayuga Indian Nation of N. Y. v.\nPataki, 413 F. 3d 266, 274–277 (CA2 2005) (laches avail-\nable in a “possessory land claim” in which the District\nCourt awarded damages, whether “characterized as an\naction at law or in equity,” and dismissing the action due\nto laches); Teamsters, 283 F. 3d, at 881–883 (laches avail-\nable in suits under ERISA for benefits, but not warranted\nin that case); Hot Wax, 191 F. 3d, at 822–827 (“[T]he ap-\nplication of the doctrine of laches to Hot Wax’s Lanham\nAct claims [requesting damages] by the district court was\nproper”); A. C. Aukerman Co. v. R. L. Chaides Constr. Co.,\n960 F. 2d 1020, 1030–1032, 1045–1046 (CAFed 1992) (en\nbanc) (laches available in patent suit claiming damages,\nand remanding for whether the defense was successful);\nCornetta v. United States, 851 F. 2d 1372, 1376–1383\n(CAFed 1988) (en banc) (same, in suit seeking backpay).\nEven if we focus only upon federal copyright litigation,\nfour of the six Circuits to have considered the matter have\nheld that laches can bar claims for legal relief.

Deseret Book Co., 287 F.\n3d 936, 950–951 (CA10 2002) (laches available in “ ‘rare\ncases,’ ” and failing to draw a distinction in the type of\nremedy sought (citation omitted). But see New Era Publi-\ncations Int’l v. Henry Holt & Co., 873 F. 2d 576, 584–585\n(CA2 1989) (laches can bar claims for injunctive relief, but\nnot damages, under the Copyright Act); Lyons Partner-\nship, L. P. v. Morris Costumes, Inc., 243 F. 3d 789, 798–\n799 (CA4 2001) (laches unavailable in copyright cases\naltogether).\n   Perhaps more importantly, in permitting laches to apply\nto copyright claims seeking equitable relief but not to\nthose seeking legal relief, the majority places insufficient\nweight upon the rules and practice of modern litigation.\nSince 1938, Congress and the Federal Rules have replaced\nwhat would once have been actions “at law” and actions\n“in equity” with the “civil action.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 2\n(“There is one form of action—the civil action”). A federal\ncivil action is subject to both equitable and legal defenses.\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c)(1) (“In responding to a pleading, a\nparty must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirma-\ntive defense, including: . . . estoppel . . . laches . . . [and]\nstatute of limitations”). Accordingly, since 1938, federal\ncourts have frequently allowed defendants to assert what\nwere formerly equitable defenses—including laches—in\nwhat were formerly legal actions. See supra, at 10–11\n(citing cases). Why should copyright be treated differ-\nently? Indeed, the majority concedes that “restitutional\nremedies” like “profits” (which are often claimed in copy-\nright cases) defy clear classification as “equitable” or\n“legal.” Ante, at 2, n. 1 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Why should lower courts have to make these uneasy\nand unnatural distinctions?\n   Fifth, the majority believes it can prevent the inequities\nthat laches seeks to avoid through the use of a different\ndoctrine, namely equitable estoppel. Ante, at 19. I doubt\n                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat is so. As the majority recognizes, “the two defenses\nare differently oriented.” Ibid. The “gravamen” of estop-\npel is a misleading representation by the plaintiff that the\ndefendant relies on to his detriment. 6 Patry, Copyright\n§20:58, at 20–110 to 20–112. The gravamen of laches is\nthe plaintiff ’s unreasonable delay, and the consequent\nprejudice to the defendant. Id., §20:54, at 20–96. Where\ndue to the passage of time, evidence favorable to the de-\nfense has disappeared or the defendant has continued to\ninvest in a derivative work, what misleading representa-\ntion by the plaintiff is there to estop?\n   In sum, as the majority says, the doctrine of laches may\noccupy only a “ ‘little place’ ” in a regime based upon stat-\nutes of limitations. Ante, at 20 (quoting 1 D. Dobbs, Law\nof Remedies §2.6(1), p. 152 (2d ed. 1993)). But that place\nis an important one. In those few and unusual cases\nwhere a plaintiff unreasonably delays in bringing suit and\nconsequently causes inequitable harm to the defendant,\nthe doctrine permits a court to bring about a fair result. I\nsee no reason to erase the doctrine from copyright’s lexi-\ncon, not even in respect to limitations periods applicable to\ndamages actions.\n   Consequently, with respect, I dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2674861/", "sha1": "ed978e87458a9e0b2c1f4ab4b3e550a541084440", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2014-05-19T08:00:59.362099"}
