Argued March 26, 2014—Decided May 27, 2014\nWhile campaigning for a second term, President George W. Bush was\n scheduled to spend the night at a Jacksonville, Oregon, cottage. Lo-\n cal law enforcement officials permitted a group of Bush supporters\n and a group of protesters to assemble on opposite sides of a street\n along the President’s motorcade route. When the President made a\n last-minute decision to have dinner at the outdoor patio area of the\n Jacksonville Inn’s restaurant before resuming the drive to the cot-\n tage, the protesters moved to an area in front of the Inn, which\n placed them within weapons range of the President. The supporters\n remained in their original location, where a two-story building\n blocked sight of, and weapons access to, the patio. At the direction of\n two Secret Service agents responsible for the President’s security, pe-\n titioners here (the agents), local police cleared the area where the\n protesters had gathered, eventually moving them two blocks away to\n a street beyond weapons reach of the President. The agents did not\n require the guests already inside the Inn to leave, stay clear of the\n patio, or go through a security screening. After the President dined,\n his motorcade passed the supporters, but the protesters, now two\n blocks from the motorcade’s route, were beyond his sight and hear-\n ing.\n    The protesters sued the agents for damages, alleging that the\n agents engaged in viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First\n Amendment when they moved the protesters away from the Inn but\n allowed the supporters to remain in their original location. The Dis-\n trict Court denied the agents’ motion to dismiss the suit for failure to\n state a claim and on qualified immunity grounds, but on interlocuto-\n ry appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed. The court held that the pro-\n testers had failed to state a First Amendment claim under the plead-\n2                            WOOD v. MOSS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ing standards of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, and\n    Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662. Because those decisions were ren-\n    dered after the protesters commenced suit, the Court of Appeals\n    granted leave to amend the complaint. On remand, the protesters\n    supplemented the complaint with allegations that the agents acted\n    pursuant to an unwritten Secret Service policy of working with the\n    Bush White House to inhibit the expression of disfavored views at\n    presidential appearances. The District Court denied the agents’ re-\n    newed motion to dismiss. This time, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, con-\n    cluding that viewpoint-driven conduct on the agents’ part could be in-\n    ferred from the absence of a legitimate security rationale for the\n    different treatment accorded the two groups of demonstrators. The\n    Court of Appeals further held that the agents were not entitled to\n    qualified immunity because this Court’s precedent made clear that\n    the Government may not regulate speech based on its content.\nHeld: The agents are entitled to qualified immunity. Pp. 11–18.\n    (a) Government officials may not exclude from public places per-\n sons engaged in peaceful expressive activity solely because the gov-\n ernment actor fears, dislikes, or disagrees with the views expressed.\n See, e.g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 96. The fun-\n damental right to speak, however, does not leave people at liberty to\n publicize their views “ ‘whenever and however and wherever they\n please.’ ” United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177. In deciding\n whether the protesters have alleged violation of a clearly established\n First Amendment right, this Court assumes without deciding that\n Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, which\n involved alleged Fourth Amendment violations, extends to First\n Amendment claims, see, e.g., Iqbal, 556 U. S., at 675.\n    The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials\n from liability for civil damages “unless a plaintiff pleads facts show-\n ing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,\n and (2) that the right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the chal-\n lenged conduct.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___. The “dispos-\n itive inquiry . . . is whether it would [have been] clear to a reasonable\n officer” in the agents’ position “that [their] conduct was unlawful in\n the situation [they] confronted.” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 202.\n At the time of the Jacksonville incident, this Court had addressed a\n constitutional challenge to Secret Service actions only once. In\n Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U. S. 224, the plaintiff challenged the lawful-\n ness of his arrest by two Secret Service agents for writing and deliv-\n ering a letter about a plot to assassinate President Reagan. Holding\n that the agents were shielded by qualified immunity, the Court stat-\n ed that “accommodation for reasonable error . . . is nowhere more im-\n portant than when the specter of Presidential assassination is\n                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nraised.” Id., at 229. This Court has recognized the overwhelming\nimportance of safeguarding the President in other contexts as well.\nSee Watts v. United States, 394 U. S. 705, 707. Mindful that officers\nmay be faced with unanticipated security situations, the key question\naddressed is whether it should have been clear to the agents that the\nsecurity perimeter they established violated the First Amendment.\nPp. 11–13.\n   (b) The protesters assert, and the Ninth Circuit agreed, that the\nagents violated clearly established federal law by denying them\n“equal access to the President.” No decision of which the Court is\naware, however, would alert Secret Service agents engaged in crowd\ncontrol that they bear a First Amendment obligation to make sure\nthat groups with conflicting views are at all times in equivalent posi-\ntions. Nor would the maintenance of equal access make sense in the\nsituation the agents here confronted, where only the protesters, not\nthe supporters, had a direct line of sight to the patio where the Presi-\ndent was dining. The protesters suggest that the agents could have\nmoved the supporters out of the motorcade’s range as well, but there\nwould have been no security rationale for such a move. Pp. 13–15.\n   (c) The protesters allege that, in directing their displacement, the\nagents acted not to ensure the President’s safety, but to insulate the\nPresident from their message. These allegations are undermined by\na map of the area, which shows that, because of the protesters’ loca-\ntion, they posed a potential security risk to the President, while the\nsupporters, because of their location, did not. The protesters’ coun-\nterarguments are unavailing. They urge that, had the agents’ pro-\nfessed interest in the President’s safety been sincere, the agents\nwould have screened or removed from the premises persons already\nat the Inn when the President arrived. But staff, other diners, and\nInn guests were on the premises before the agents knew of the Presi-\ndent’s plans, and thus could not have anticipated seeing the Presi-\ndent, no less causing harm to him. The agents also could keep a close\nwatch on the relatively small number of people already inside the\nInn, surveillance that would have been impossible for the hundreds of\npeople outside the Inn. A White House manual directs the Presi-\ndent’s advance team to “work with the Secret Service . . . to designate\na protest area . . . preferably not in view of the event site or motor-\ncade route.” The manual guides the conduct of the political advance\nteam, not the Secret Service, whose own written guides explicitly\nprohibit “agents from discriminating between anti-government and\npro-government demonstrators.” Even assuming, as the protesters\nmaintain, that other agents, at other times and places, have assisted\nin shielding the President from political speech, this case is scarcely\none in which the agents lacked a valid security reason for their ac-\n4                             WOOD v. MOSS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tions. Moreover, because individual government officials “cannot be\n    held liable” in a Bivens suit “unless they themselves acted [unconsti-\n    tutionally],” Iqbal, 556 U. S., at 683, this Court declines to infer from\n    alleged instances of misconduct on the part of particular agents an\n    unwritten Secret Service policy to suppress disfavored expression,\n    and then attribute that supposed policy to all field-level operatives.\n    Pp. 15–18.\n711 F. 3d 941, reversed.\n\n    GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                       Cite as: 572 U.

The episode in suit occurred in Jackson-\nville, Oregon, on the evening of October 14, 2004. Presi-\ndent George W. Bush, campaigning in the area for a sec-\nond term, was scheduled to spend the evening at a cottage\nin Jacksonville. With permission from local law enforce-\nment officials, two groups assembled on opposite sides of\nthe street on which the President’s motorcade was to\ntravel to reach the cottage. One group supported the\nPresident, the other opposed him.\n  The President made a last-minute decision to stop in\ntown for dinner before completing the drive to the cottage.\nHis motorcade therefore turned from the planned route\nand proceeded to the outdoor patio dining area of the\nJacksonville Inn’s restaurant. Learning of the route\nchange, the protesters moved down the sidewalk to the\narea in front of the Inn. The President’s supporters re-\nmained across the street and about a half block away from\n2                       WOOD v. MOSS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Inn. At the direction of the Secret Service agents,\nstate and local police cleared the block on which the Inn\nwas located and moved the protesters some two blocks\naway to a street beyond handgun or explosive reach of the\nPresident. The move placed the protesters a block farther\naway from the Inn than the supporters.\n  Officials are sheltered from suit, under a doctrine\nknown as qualified immunity, when their conduct “does\nnot violate clearly established . . . constitutional rights” a\nreasonable official, similarly situated, would have compre-\nhended. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982).\nThe First Amendment, our precedent makes plain, disfa-\nvors viewpoint-based discrimination. See Rosenberger v.\nRector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 828\n(1995). But safeguarding the President is also of over-\nwhelming importance in our constitutional system. See\nWatts v. United States, 394 U. S. 705, 707 (1969) (per\ncuriam). Faced with the President’s sudden decision to\nstop for dinner, the Secret Service agents had to cope with\na security situation not earlier anticipated. No decision of\nthis Court so much as hinted that their on-the-spot action\nwas unlawful because they failed to keep the protesters\nand supporters, throughout the episode, equidistant from\nthe President.\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit ruled otherwise. It found dispositive of the agents’\nmotion to dismiss “the considerable disparity in the dis-\ntance each group was allowed to stand from the Presi-\nden[t].” Moss v. United States Secret Serv., 711 F. 3d 941,\n946 (2013). Because no “clearly established law” so con-\ntrolled the agents’ response to the motorcade’s detour, we\nreverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.\n                             I\n                             A\n    On October 14, 2004, after a nearby campaign appear-\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)      3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nance, President George W. Bush was scheduled to spend\nthe night at a cottage in Jacksonville, Oregon. Anticipat-\ning the visit, a group of individuals, including respondents\n(the protesters), organized a demonstration to express\ntheir opposition to the President and his policies. At\naround 6:00 p.m. on the evening the President’s motorcade\nwas expected to pass through the town, between 200 and\n300 protesters gathered in Jacksonville, on California\nStreet between Third and Fourth Streets. See infra, at 4\n(map depicting the relevant area in Jacksonville). The\ngathering had been precleared with local law enforcement\nauthorities. On the opposite side of Third Street, a simi-\nlarly sized group of individuals (the supporters) assembled\nto show their support for the President. If, as planned, the\nmotorcade had traveled down Third Street to reach the\ncottage, with no stops along the way, the protesters and\nsupporters would have had equal access to the President\nthroughout in delivering their respective messages.\n  This situation was unsettled when President Bush made\na spur-of-the-moment decision to stop for dinner at the\nJacksonville Inn before proceeding to the cottage. The Inn\nstands on the north side of California Street, on the block\nwhere the protesters had assembled. Learning of the\nPresident’s change in plans, the protesters moved along\nthe block to face the Inn. The respective positions of the\nprotesters and supporters at the time the President ar-\nrived at the Inn are shown on the following map, which\nthe protesters attached as an exhibit to their complaint:1\n\n\n\n\n——————\n 1 App.   to Brief for Petitioners (Diagram A).\n4                      WOOD v.

The map also shows an alley\nrunning along the east side of the Inn (the California\nStreet alley) leading to an outdoor patio used by the Inn’s\nrestaurant as a dining area. A six-foot high wooden fence\nsurrounded the patio. At the location where the Presi-\ndent’s supporters gathered, a large two-story building, the\nU. S. Hotel, extended north around the corner of Califor-\nnia and Third Streets. That structure blocked sight of,\nand weapons access to, the patio from points on California\nStreet west of the Inn.\n   Petitioners are two Secret Service agents (the agents)\nresponsible for the President’s security during the Jack-\nsonville visit. Shortly after 7:00 p.m. on the evening in\nquestion, the agents enlisted the aid of local police officers\nto secure the area for the President’s unexpected stop at\nthe Inn. Following the agents’ instructions, the local\nofficers first cleared the alley running from Third Street to\nthe patio (the Third Street alley), which the President’s\nmotorcade would use to access the Inn. The officers then\ncleared Third Street north of California Street, as well as\nthe California Street alley.\n   At around 7:15 p.m., the President arrived at the Inn.\nAs the motorcade entered the Third Street alley, both sets\nof demonstrators were equally within the President’s sight\nand hearing. When the President reached the outdoor\npatio dining area, the protesters stood on the sidewalk\ndirectly in front of the California Street alley, exhibiting\nsigns and chanting slogans critical of the President and\nhis policies. In view of the short distance between Cali-\nfornia Street and the patio, the protesters no longer con-\ntest that they were then within weapons range of the\nPresident. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 3–4, 35, 39–40; Brief for\nPetitioners 44.\n   Approximately 15 minutes later, the agents directed the\nofficers to clear the protesters from the block in front of\nthe Inn and move them to the east side of Fourth Street.\n6                         WOOD v. MOSS\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nFrom their new location, the protesters were roughly the\nsame distance from the President as the supporters. But\nunlike the supporters, whose sight and access were ob-\nstructed by the U. S. Hotel, only a parking lot separated\nthe protesters from the patio. The protesters thus re-\nmained within weapons range of, and had a direct line of\nsight to, the President’s location. This sight line is illus-\ntrated by the broken arrow marked on the map below.2\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  2 This map appears as an appendix to the agents’ opening brief.

The relocation was necessary, the agents told the\nlocal officers, to ensure that no demonstrator would be\n“within handgun or explosive range of the President.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 177a. The agents, however, did not\nrequire the guests already inside the Inn to leave, stay\nclear of the patio, or go through any security screening.\nThe supporters at all times retained their original location\non the west side of Third Street.\n  After the President dined, the motorcade left the Inn by\ntraveling south on Third Street toward the cottage. On its\nway, the motorcade passed the President’s supporters.\nThe protesters remained on Fifth Street, two blocks away\nfrom the motorcade’s route, thus beyond the President’s\nsight and hearing.\n                               B\n   The protesters sued the agents for damages in the U. S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Oregon. The agents’\nactions, the complaint asserted, violated the protesters’\nFirst Amendment rights by the manner in which the\nagents established a security perimeter around the Presi-\ndent during his unscheduled stop for dinner. See Bivens v.\nSix Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971)\n(recognizing claim for damages against federal agents for\nviolations of plaintiff ’s Fourth Amendment rights).3 Spe-\ncifically, the protesters alleged that the agents engaged in\nviewpoint discrimination when they moved the protesters\naway from the Inn, while allowing the supporters to re-\nmain in their original location.\n   The agents moved to dismiss the complaint on the\nground that the protesters’ allegations were insufficient to\n——————\n  3 The protesters’ complaint also asserted claims against local police\n\nofficers for using excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\nThose claims were dismissed for failure to state a claim, see Moss v.\nUnited States Secret Serv., 711 F. 3d 941, 954 (CA9 2013), and are not\nat issue here.\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

The\nagents further maintained that they were sheltered by\nqualified immunity because the constitutional right al-\nleged by the protesters was not clearly established.\n   The District Court denied the motion, see Moss v.

S. Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. See Moss v. United\nStates Secret Serv., 572 F. 3d 962 (2009). The facts alleged\nin the complaint, the Court of Appeals held, were insuffi-\ncient to state a First Amendment claim under the pleading\nstandards prescribed in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,\n550 U. S. 544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662\n(2009). 572 F. 3d, at 974–975.5 Because Twombly and\nIqbal were decided after the protesters filed their com-\nplaint, however, the Ninth Circuit instructed the District\nCourt to grant the protesters leave to amend. 572 F. 3d,\nat 972.\n   On remand, the protesters supplemented their com-\nplaint with allegations that the agents acted pursuant to\nan “actual but unwritten” Secret Service policy of\n“work[ing] with the White House under President Bush to\neliminate dissent and protest from presidential appear-\nances.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a. Relying on published\nmedia reports, the protesters’ amended complaint cited\nseveral instances in which other Secret Service agents\nallegedly engaged in conduct designed to suppress expres-\nsion critical of President Bush at his public appearances.\n——————\n  4 We   have repeatedly “stressed the importance of resolving immunity\nquestions at the earliest possible stage [of the] litigation,” Hunter v.\nBryant, 502 U. S. 224, 227 (1991) (per curiam).\n   5 In ruling on a motion to dismiss, we have instructed, courts “must\n\ntake all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true,” but “are not\nbound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allega-\ntion.” Ashcroft v.

See\nalso id., at 183a.\n  The agents renewed their motion to dismiss the suit for\nfailure to state a claim and on qualified immunity\ngrounds.

See id., at 946. The\nCourt of Appeals further held that the agents were not\nentitled to qualified immunity because this Court’s prece-\ndent “make[s] clear . . . ‘that the government may not\nregulate speech based on its substantive content or the\nmessage it conveys.’ ” Id., at 963 (quoting Rosenberger,\n515 U. S., at 828).\n  The agents petitioned for rehearing and rehearing en\nbanc, urging that the panel erred in finding the alleged\nconstitutional violation clearly established. Over the\ndissent of eight judges, the Ninth Circuit denied the en\nbanc petition. See 711 F. 3d, at 947 (O’Scannlain, J.,\ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).

See, e.g., Police Dept. of\nChicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 96 (1972). It is equally\nplain that the fundamental right to speak secured by the\nFirst Amendment does not leave people at liberty to pub-\nlicize their views “ ‘whenever and however and wher-\never they please.’ ” United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171,\n177–178 (1983) (quoting Adderly v. Florida, 385 U. S.\n39, 48 (1966)). Our decision in this case starts from those\npremises.\n   The particular question before us is whether the pro-\ntesters have alleged violation of a clearly established First\nAmendment right based on the agents’ decision to order\nthe protesters moved from their original location in front\nof the Inn, first to the block just east of the Inn, and then\nanother block farther. We note, initially, an antecedent\nissue: Does the First Amendment give rise to an implied\nright of action for damages against federal officers who\nviolate that Amendment’s guarantees? In Bivens, cited\nsupra, at 8, we recognized an implied right of action\nagainst federal officers for violations of the Fourth\nAmendment. Thereafter, we have several times assumed\nwithout deciding that Bivens extends to First Amendment\nclaims. See, e.g., Iqbal, 556 U. S., at 675. We do so again\nin this case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10–11 (counsel for peti-\ntioners observed that the implication of a right to sue\nderived from the First Amendment itself was an issue “not\npreserved below” and therefore “not presented” in this\nCourt).\n   The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government\nofficials from liability for civil damages “unless a plaintiff\n12                          WOOD v.

S., at 678 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Requiring the alleged violation of law to be “clearly\nestablished” “balances . . . the need to hold public officials\naccountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and\nthe need to shield officials from harassment, distraction,\nand liability when they perform their duties reasonably.”\nPearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 231 (2009). The “dis-\npositive inquiry,” we have said, “is whether it would [have\nbeen] clear to a reasonable officer” in the agents’ position\n“that [their] conduct was unlawful in the situation [they]\nconfronted.” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 202 (2001).\n   At the time of the Jacksonville incident, this Court had\naddressed a constitutional challenge to Secret Service\nactions on only one occasion.6 In Hunter v. Bryant, 502\nU. S. 224 (1991) (per curiam), the plaintiff sued two Secret\nService agents alleging that they arrested him without\nprobable cause for writing and delivering to two Univer-\nsity of Southern California offices a letter referring to a\nplot to assassinate President Ronald Reagan. We held that\nqualified immunity shielded the agents from claims that\nthe arrest violated the plaintiff ’s rights under the Fourth,\nFifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. “[N]owhere,”\nwe stated, is “accommodation for reasonable error . . .\n——————\n  6 Subsequent to the incident at issue here, we held in Reichle v.

But, the court determined, no\nreason was shown for “the considerable disparity in the\ndistance each group was allowed to stand from the Presi-\ndential party.” Ibid. The agents thus offended the First\nAmendment, in the Court of Appeals’ view, because their\ndirections to the local officers placed the protesters at a\n“comparativ[e] disadvantag[e] in expressing their views”\nto the President. Ibid.\n  No decision of which we are aware, however, would alert\nSecret Service agents engaged in crowd control that they\nbear a First Amendment obligation “to ensure that groups\nwith different viewpoints are at comparable locations at\nall times.” Id., at 952 (O’Scannlain, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc). Nor would the maintenance\nof equal access make sense in the situation the agents\nconfronted.\n  Recall that at the protesters’ location on the north side\nof California Street, see supra, at 4, they faced an alley\ngiving them a direct line of sight to the outdoor patio\nwhere the President stopped to dine. The first move, to\nthe corner of Fourth and California Streets, proved no\nsolution, for there, only a parking lot stood between the\nprotesters and the patio. True, at both locations, a six-foot\nwooden fence and an unspecified number of local police\nofficers impeded access to the President. Even so, 200 to\n300 protesters were within weapons range, and had a\nlargely unobstructed view, of the President’s location. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 41 (counsel for respondents acknowledged\nthat “in hindsight, you could . . . conclude” that “proximity\n[of the protesters to the President] alone . . . is enough to\ncreate a security [risk]”). See also Eggen & Fletcher, FBI:\nGrenade Was a Threat to Bush, Washington Post, May 19,\n2005, p.

See App. Pet. for Cert.\n178a. As earlier explained, however, see supra, at 4–5,\nthere would have been no security rationale for such a\nmove. In contrast to the open alley and parking lot on the\neast side of the Inn, to the west of the Inn where the sup-\nporters stood, a large, two-story building blocked sight of,\nor weapons access to, the patio the agents endeavored to\nsecure.8 No clearly established law, we agree, required the\nSecret Service “to interfere with even more speech than\nsecurity concerns would require in an attempt to keep\nopposing groups at roughly equal distances from the Pres-\nident.” Brief for Petitioners 32. And surely no such law\nrequired the agents to attempt to maintain equal dis-\ntances by “prevail[ing] upon the President not to dine at the\nInn.” Oral Arg.

The\nPresident’s detour for dinner, however, set the two groups apart. “[T]he\nsecurity concerns arising from the presence of a large group of people\nnear the open-air patio where the President was dining were plainly\ndifferent from those associated with permitting a group . . . to remain\nalong Third Street while the President’s [armored limousine] traveled\nby.” Brief for Petitioners 46.\n16                     WOOD v. MOSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nInstead, the protesters urge, the agents had them moved\nsolely to insulate the President from their message, thereby\ngiving the President’s supporters greater visibility and\naudibility. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35–36. The Ninth Circuit\nfound sufficient the protesters’ allegations that the agents\n“acted with the sole intent to discriminate against [the\nprotesters] because of their viewpoint”. 711 F. 3d, at 964.\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals “allow[ed] the protes-\ntors’ claim of viewpoint discrimination to proceed.” Id., at\n962.\n   It may be, the agents acknowledged, that clearly estab-\nlished law proscribed the Secret Service from disadvantag-\ning one group of speakers in comparison to another if the\nagents had “no objectively reasonable security rationale”\nfor their conduct, but acted solely to inhibit the expression\nof disfavored views. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–29; Brief for\nPetitioners 52 (entitlement to relief might have been\nestablished if, for example, “the pro-Bush group had . . .\nbeen allowed to move into the nearer location that the\nanti-Bush had vacated”). We agree with the agents, how-\never, that the map itself, reproduced supra, at 4, under-\nmines the protesters’ allegations of viewpoint discrimina-\ntion as the sole reason for the agents’ directions. The map\ncorroborates that, because of their location, the protesters\nposed a potential security risk to the President, while the\nsupporters, because of their location, did not.\n   The protesters make three arguments to shore up their\ncharge that the agents’ asserted security concerns are\ndisingenuous. First, the protesters urge that, had the\nagents’ professed interest in the President’s safety been\nsincere, the agents would have directed all persons pres-\nent at the Inn to be screened or removed from the prem-\nises. See Brief for Respondents 27. But staff, other din-\ners, and Inn guests were there even before the agents\nthemselves knew that the President would dine at the Inn.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 47. Those already at the Inn\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

The\nSecret Service, moreover, could take measures to ensure\nthat the relatively small number of people already inside\nthe Inn were kept under close watch; no similar surveil-\nlance would have been possible for 200 to 300 people\ncongregating in front of the Inn. See ibid.\n   The protesters also point to a White House manual,\nwhich states that the President’s advance team should\n“work with the Secret Service . . . to designate a protest\narea . . . preferably not in view of the event site or motor-\ncade route.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 219a. This manual\nguides the conduct of the President’s political advance\nteam. See id., at 220a (distinguishing between the politi-\ncal role of the advance team and the security mission of\nthe Secret Service).9 As the complaint acknowledges, the\nSecret Service has its own “written guidelines, directives,\ninstructions and rules.” Id., at 184a. Those guides explic-\nitly “prohibit Secret Service agents from discriminating\nbetween anti-government and pro-government demonstra-\ntors.” Ibid.\n   The protesters maintain that the Secret Service does not\nadhere to its own written guides. They recite several\ninstances in which Secret Service agents allegedly en-\ngaged in viewpoint discrimination. See id., at 189a–194a.\nEven accepting as true the submission that Secret Service\nagents, at times, have assisted in shielding the President\nfrom political speech, this case is scarcely one in which the\nagents acted “without a valid security reason.” Brief for\n——————\n   9 “An ‘advance man’ is ‘[o]ne who arranges for publicity, protocol,\n\ntransportation, speaking schedules, conferences with local government\nofficials, and minute details of a visit, smoothing the way for a political\nfigure.’ ” See 711 F. 3d, at 950, n. 2 (O’Scannlain, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc) (quoting W.

We emphasize, again, that the protesters\nwere at least as close to the President as were the sup-\nporters when the motorcade arrived at the Jacksonville\nInn. See supra, at 5. And as the map attached to the\ncomplaint shows, see supra, at 4, when the President\nreached the patio to dine, the protesters, but not the sup-\nporters, were within weapons range of his location. See\nsupra, at 14. Given that situation, the protesters cannot\nplausibly urge that the agents “had no valid security\nreason to request or order the[ir] eviction.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 186a.\n  We note, moreover, that individual government officials\n“cannot be held liable” in a Bivens suit “unless they them-\nselves acted [unconstitutionally].” Iqbal, 556 U. S., at 683.\nWe therefore decline to infer from alleged instances of\nmisconduct on the part of particular agents an unwritten\npolicy of the Secret Service to suppress disfavored expres-\nsion, and then to attribute that supposed policy to all field-\nlevel operatives.

Argued March 26, 2014—Decided May 27, 2014\nWhile campaigning for a second term, President George W. Bush was\n scheduled to spend the night at a Jacksonville, Oregon, cottage. Lo-\n cal law enforcement officials permitted a group of Bush supporters\n and a group of protesters to assemble on opposite sides of a street\n along the President’s motorcade route. When the President made a\n last-minute decision to have dinner at the outdoor patio area of the\n Jacksonville Inn’s restaurant before resuming the drive to the cot-\n tage, the protesters moved to an area in front of the Inn, which\n placed them within weapons range of the President. The supporters\n remained in their original location, where a two-story building\n blocked sight of, and weapons access to, the patio. At the direction of\n two Secret Service agents responsible for the President’s security, pe-\n titioners here (the agents), local police cleared the area where the\n protesters had gathered, eventually moving them two blocks away to\n a street beyond weapons reach of the President. The agents did not\n require the guests already inside the Inn to leave, stay clear of the\n patio, or go through a security screening. After the President dined,\n his motorcade passed the supporters, but the protesters, now two\n blocks from the motorcade’s route, were beyond his sight and hear-\n ing.\n    The protesters sued the agents for damages, alleging that the\n agents engaged in viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First\n Amendment when they moved the protesters away from the Inn but\n allowed the supporters to remain in their original location. The Dis-\n trict Court denied the agents’ motion to dismiss the suit for failure to\n state a claim and on qualified immunity grounds, but on interlocuto-\n ry appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed. The court held that the pro-\n testers had failed to state a First Amendment claim under the plead-\n2                            WOOD v. MOSS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ing standards of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, and\n    Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662. Because those decisions were ren-\n    dered after the protesters commenced suit, the Court of Appeals\n    granted leave to amend the complaint. On remand, the protesters\n    supplemented the complaint with allegations that the agents acted\n    pursuant to an unwritten Secret Service policy of working with the\n    Bush White House to inhibit the expression of disfavored views at\n    presidential appearances. The District Court denied the agents’ re-\n    newed motion to dismiss. This time, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, con-\n    cluding that viewpoint-driven conduct on the agents’ part could be in-\n    ferred from the absence of a legitimate security rationale for the\n    different treatment accorded the two groups of demonstrators. The\n    Court of Appeals further held that the agents were not entitled to\n    qualified immunity because this Court’s precedent made clear that\n    the Government may not regulate speech based on its content.\nHeld: The agents are entitled to qualified immunity. Pp. 11–18.\n    (a) Government officials may not exclude from public places per-\n sons engaged in peaceful expressive activity solely because the gov-\n ernment actor fears, dislikes, or disagrees with the views expressed.\n See, e.g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 96. The fun-\n damental right to speak, however, does not leave people at liberty to\n publicize their views “ ‘whenever and however and wherever they\n please.’ ” United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177. In deciding\n whether the protesters have alleged violation of a clearly established\n First Amendment right, this Court assumes without deciding that\n Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, which\n involved alleged Fourth Amendment violations, extends to First\n Amendment claims, see, e.g., Iqbal, 556 U. S., at 675.\n    The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials\n from liability for civil damages “unless a plaintiff pleads facts show-\n ing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,\n and (2) that the right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the chal-\n lenged conduct.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___. The “dispos-\n itive inquiry . . . is whether it would [have been] clear to a reasonable\n officer” in the agents’ position “that [their] conduct was unlawful in\n the situation [they] confronted.” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 202.\n At the time of the Jacksonville incident, this Court had addressed a\n constitutional challenge to Secret Service actions only once. In\n Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U. S. 224, the plaintiff challenged the lawful-\n ness of his arrest by two Secret Service agents for writing and deliv-\n ering a letter about a plot to assassinate President Reagan. Holding\n that the agents were shielded by qualified immunity, the Court stat-\n ed that “accommodation for reasonable error . . . is nowhere more im-\n portant than when the specter of Presidential assassination is\n                   Cite as: 572 U.

This Court has recognized the overwhelming\nimportance of safeguarding the President in other contexts as well.\nSee Watts v. United States, 394 U. S. 705, 707. Mindful that officers\nmay be faced with unanticipated security situations, the key question\naddressed is whether it should have been clear to the agents that the\nsecurity perimeter they established violated the First Amendment.\nPp. 11–13.\n   (b) The protesters assert, and the Ninth Circuit agreed, that the\nagents violated clearly established federal law by denying them\n“equal access to the President.” No decision of which the Court is\naware, however, would alert Secret Service agents engaged in crowd\ncontrol that they bear a First Amendment obligation to make sure\nthat groups with conflicting views are at all times in equivalent posi-\ntions. Nor would the maintenance of equal access make sense in the\nsituation the agents here confronted, where only the protesters, not\nthe supporters, had a direct line of sight to the patio where the Presi-\ndent was dining. The protesters suggest that the agents could have\nmoved the supporters out of the motorcade’s range as well, but there\nwould have been no security rationale for such a move. Pp. 13–15.\n   (c) The protesters allege that, in directing their displacement, the\nagents acted not to ensure the President’s safety, but to insulate the\nPresident from their message. These allegations are undermined by\na map of the area, which shows that, because of the protesters’ loca-\ntion, they posed a potential security risk to the President, while the\nsupporters, because of their location, did not. The protesters’ coun-\nterarguments are unavailing. They urge that, had the agents’ pro-\nfessed interest in the President’s safety been sincere, the agents\nwould have screened or removed from the premises persons already\nat the Inn when the President arrived. But staff, other diners, and\nInn guests were on the premises before the agents knew of the Presi-\ndent’s plans, and thus could not have anticipated seeing the Presi-\ndent, no less causing harm to him. The agents also could keep a close\nwatch on the relatively small number of people already inside the\nInn, surveillance that would have been impossible for the hundreds of\npeople outside the Inn. A White House manual directs the Presi-\ndent’s advance team to “work with the Secret Service . . . to designate\na protest area . . . preferably not in view of the event site or motor-\ncade route.” The manual guides the conduct of the political advance\nteam, not the Secret Service, whose own written guides explicitly\nprohibit “agents from discriminating between anti-government and\npro-government demonstrators.” Even assuming, as the protesters\nmaintain, that other agents, at other times and places, have assisted\nin shielding the President from political speech, this case is scarcely\none in which the agents lacked a valid security reason for their ac-\n4                             WOOD v.

The episode in suit occurred in Jackson-\nville, Oregon, on the evening of October 14, 2004. Presi-\ndent George W. Bush, campaigning in the area for a sec-\nond term, was scheduled to spend the evening at a cottage\nin Jacksonville. With permission from local law enforce-\nment officials, two groups assembled on opposite sides of\nthe street on which the President’s motorcade was to\ntravel to reach the cottage. One group supported the\nPresident, the other opposed him.\n  The President made a last-minute decision to stop in\ntown for dinner before completing the drive to the cottage.\nHis motorcade therefore turned from the planned route\nand proceeded to the outdoor patio dining area of the\nJacksonville Inn’s restaurant. Learning of the route\nchange, the protesters moved down the sidewalk to the\narea in front of the Inn. The President’s supporters re-\nmained across the street and about a half block away from\n2                       WOOD v. MOSS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Inn. At the direction of the Secret Service agents,\nstate and local police cleared the block on which the Inn\nwas located and moved the protesters some two blocks\naway to a street beyond handgun or explosive reach of the\nPresident. The move placed the protesters a block farther\naway from the Inn than the supporters.\n  Officials are sheltered from suit, under a doctrine\nknown as qualified immunity, when their conduct “does\nnot violate clearly established . . . constitutional rights” a\nreasonable official, similarly situated, would have compre-\nhended. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982).\nThe First Amendment, our precedent makes plain, disfa-\nvors viewpoint-based discrimination. See Rosenberger v.\nRector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 828\n(1995). But safeguarding the President is also of over-\nwhelming importance in our constitutional system. See\nWatts v. United States, 394 U. S. 705, 707 (1969) (per\ncuriam). Faced with the President’s sudden decision to\nstop for dinner, the Secret Service agents had to cope with\na security situation not earlier anticipated. No decision of\nthis Court so much as hinted that their on-the-spot action\nwas unlawful because they failed to keep the protesters\nand supporters, throughout the episode, equidistant from\nthe President.\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit ruled otherwise. It found dispositive of the agents’\nmotion to dismiss “the considerable disparity in the dis-\ntance each group was allowed to stand from the Presi-\nden[t].” Moss v. United States Secret Serv., 711 F. 3d 941,\n946 (2013). Because no “clearly established law” so con-\ntrolled the agents’ response to the motorcade’s detour, we\nreverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.\n                             I\n                             A\n    On October 14, 2004, after a nearby campaign appear-\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)      3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nance, President George W. Bush was scheduled to spend\nthe night at a cottage in Jacksonville, Oregon. Anticipat-\ning the visit, a group of individuals, including respondents\n(the protesters), organized a demonstration to express\ntheir opposition to the President and his policies. At\naround 6:00 p.m. on the evening the President’s motorcade\nwas expected to pass through the town, between 200 and\n300 protesters gathered in Jacksonville, on California\nStreet between Third and Fourth Streets. See infra, at 4\n(map depicting the relevant area in Jacksonville). The\ngathering had been precleared with local law enforcement\nauthorities. On the opposite side of Third Street, a simi-\nlarly sized group of individuals (the supporters) assembled\nto show their support for the President. If, as planned, the\nmotorcade had traveled down Third Street to reach the\ncottage, with no stops along the way, the protesters and\nsupporters would have had equal access to the President\nthroughout in delivering their respective messages.\n  This situation was unsettled when President Bush made\na spur-of-the-moment decision to stop for dinner at the\nJacksonville Inn before proceeding to the cottage. The Inn\nstands on the north side of California Street, on the block\nwhere the protesters had assembled. Learning of the\nPresident’s change in plans, the protesters moved along\nthe block to face the Inn. The respective positions of the\nprotesters and supporters at the time the President ar-\nrived at the Inn are shown on the following map, which\nthe protesters attached as an exhibit to their complaint:1\n\n\n\n\n——————\n 1 App.   to Brief for Petitioners (Diagram A).\n4                      WOOD v.

The map also shows an alley\nrunning along the east side of the Inn (the California\nStreet alley) leading to an outdoor patio used by the Inn’s\nrestaurant as a dining area. A six-foot high wooden fence\nsurrounded the patio. At the location where the Presi-\ndent’s supporters gathered, a large two-story building, the\nU. S. Hotel, extended north around the corner of Califor-\nnia and Third Streets. That structure blocked sight of,\nand weapons access to, the patio from points on California\nStreet west of the Inn.\n   Petitioners are two Secret Service agents (the agents)\nresponsible for the President’s security during the Jack-\nsonville visit. Shortly after 7:00 p.m. on the evening in\nquestion, the agents enlisted the aid of local police officers\nto secure the area for the President’s unexpected stop at\nthe Inn. Following the agents’ instructions, the local\nofficers first cleared the alley running from Third Street to\nthe patio (the Third Street alley), which the President’s\nmotorcade would use to access the Inn. The officers then\ncleared Third Street north of California Street, as well as\nthe California Street alley.\n   At around 7:15 p.m., the President arrived at the Inn.\nAs the motorcade entered the Third Street alley, both sets\nof demonstrators were equally within the President’s sight\nand hearing. When the President reached the outdoor\npatio dining area, the protesters stood on the sidewalk\ndirectly in front of the California Street alley, exhibiting\nsigns and chanting slogans critical of the President and\nhis policies. In view of the short distance between Cali-\nfornia Street and the patio, the protesters no longer con-\ntest that they were then within weapons range of the\nPresident. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 3–4, 35, 39–40; Brief for\nPetitioners 44.\n   Approximately 15 minutes later, the agents directed the\nofficers to clear the protesters from the block in front of\nthe Inn and move them to the east side of Fourth Street.\n6                         WOOD v. MOSS\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nFrom their new location, the protesters were roughly the\nsame distance from the President as the supporters. But\nunlike the supporters, whose sight and access were ob-\nstructed by the U. S. Hotel, only a parking lot separated\nthe protesters from the patio. The protesters thus re-\nmained within weapons range of, and had a direct line of\nsight to, the President’s location. This sight line is illus-\ntrated by the broken arrow marked on the map below.2\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  2 This map appears as an appendix to the agents’ opening brief.

MOSS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nStreet. The relocation was necessary, the agents told the\nlocal officers, to ensure that no demonstrator would be\n“within handgun or explosive range of the President.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 177a. The agents, however, did not\nrequire the guests already inside the Inn to leave, stay\nclear of the patio, or go through any security screening.\nThe supporters at all times retained their original location\non the west side of Third Street.\n  After the President dined, the motorcade left the Inn by\ntraveling south on Third Street toward the cottage. On its\nway, the motorcade passed the President’s supporters.\nThe protesters remained on Fifth Street, two blocks away\nfrom the motorcade’s route, thus beyond the President’s\nsight and hearing.\n                               B\n   The protesters sued the agents for damages in the U. S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Oregon. The agents’\nactions, the complaint asserted, violated the protesters’\nFirst Amendment rights by the manner in which the\nagents established a security perimeter around the Presi-\ndent during his unscheduled stop for dinner. See Bivens v.\nSix Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971)\n(recognizing claim for damages against federal agents for\nviolations of plaintiff ’s Fourth Amendment rights).3 Spe-\ncifically, the protesters alleged that the agents engaged in\nviewpoint discrimination when they moved the protesters\naway from the Inn, while allowing the supporters to re-\nmain in their original location.\n   The agents moved to dismiss the complaint on the\nground that the protesters’ allegations were insufficient to\n——————\n  3 The protesters’ complaint also asserted claims against local police\n\nofficers for using excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\nThose claims were dismissed for failure to state a claim, see Moss v.\nUnited States Secret Serv., 711 F. 3d 941, 954 (CA9 2013), and are not\nat issue here.\n                      Cite as: 572 U.

The\nagents further maintained that they were sheltered by\nqualified immunity because the constitutional right al-\nleged by the protesters was not clearly established.\n   The District Court denied the motion, see Moss v. United\nStates Secret Serv., 2007 WL 2915608, *1, 20 (D Ore., Oct.\n7, 2007), but on interlocutory appeal,4 the U. S. Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. See Moss v. United\nStates Secret Serv., 572 F. 3d 962 (2009). The facts alleged\nin the complaint, the Court of Appeals held, were insuffi-\ncient to state a First Amendment claim under the pleading\nstandards prescribed in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,\n550 U. S. 544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662\n(2009). 572 F. 3d, at 974–975.5 Because Twombly and\nIqbal were decided after the protesters filed their com-\nplaint, however, the Ninth Circuit instructed the District\nCourt to grant the protesters leave to amend. 572 F. 3d,\nat 972.\n   On remand, the protesters supplemented their com-\nplaint with allegations that the agents acted pursuant to\nan “actual but unwritten” Secret Service policy of\n“work[ing] with the White House under President Bush to\neliminate dissent and protest from presidential appear-\nances.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a. Relying on published\nmedia reports, the protesters’ amended complaint cited\nseveral instances in which other Secret Service agents\nallegedly engaged in conduct designed to suppress expres-\nsion critical of President Bush at his public appearances.\n——————\n  4 We   have repeatedly “stressed the importance of resolving immunity\nquestions at the earliest possible stage [of the] litigation,” Hunter v.\nBryant, 502 U. S. 224, 227 (1991) (per curiam).\n   5 In ruling on a motion to dismiss, we have instructed, courts “must\n\ntake all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true,” but “are not\nbound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allega-\ntion.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n10                     WOOD v. MOSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe amended complaint also included an excerpt from a\nWhite House manual instructing the President’s advance\nteam to “work with the Secret Service and have them ask\nthe local police department to designate a protest area\nwhere demonstrators can be placed; preferably not in view\nof the event site or motorcade route.” Id., at 219a. See\nalso id., at 183a.\n  The agents renewed their motion to dismiss the suit for\nfailure to state a claim and on qualified immunity\ngrounds. The District Court denied the motion, holding\nthat the complaint adequately alleged a violation of the\nFirst Amendment, and that the constitutional right as-\nserted was clearly established. Moss v. United States\nSecret Serv., 750 F. Supp. 2d 1197, 1216–1228 (Ore. 2010).\nThe agents again sought an interlocutory appeal.\n  This time, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, 711 F. 3d 941,\nsatisfied that the amended pleading plausibly alleged that\nthe agents “sought to suppress [the protesters’] political\nspeech” based on the viewpoint they expressed, id., at 958.\nViewpoint-driven conduct, the Court of Appeals main-\ntained, could be inferred from the absence of a legitimate\nsecurity rationale for “the differential treatment” accorded\nthe two groups of demonstrators. See id., at 946. The\nCourt of Appeals further held that the agents were not\nentitled to qualified immunity because this Court’s prece-\ndent “make[s] clear . . . ‘that the government may not\nregulate speech based on its substantive content or the\nmessage it conveys.’ ” Id., at 963 (quoting Rosenberger,\n515 U. S., at 828).\n  The agents petitioned for rehearing and rehearing en\nbanc, urging that the panel erred in finding the alleged\nconstitutional violation clearly established. Over the\ndissent of eight judges, the Ninth Circuit denied the en\nbanc petition. See 711 F. 3d, at 947 (O’Scannlain, J.,\ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). We granted\ncertiorari. 571 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                  Cite as: 572 U.

See, e.g., Police Dept. of\nChicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 96 (1972). It is equally\nplain that the fundamental right to speak secured by the\nFirst Amendment does not leave people at liberty to pub-\nlicize their views “ ‘whenever and however and wher-\never they please.’ ” United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171,\n177–178 (1983) (quoting Adderly v. Florida, 385 U. S.\n39, 48 (1966)). Our decision in this case starts from those\npremises.\n   The particular question before us is whether the pro-\ntesters have alleged violation of a clearly established First\nAmendment right based on the agents’ decision to order\nthe protesters moved from their original location in front\nof the Inn, first to the block just east of the Inn, and then\nanother block farther. We note, initially, an antecedent\nissue: Does the First Amendment give rise to an implied\nright of action for damages against federal officers who\nviolate that Amendment’s guarantees? In Bivens, cited\nsupra, at 8, we recognized an implied right of action\nagainst federal officers for violations of the Fourth\nAmendment. Thereafter, we have several times assumed\nwithout deciding that Bivens extends to First Amendment\nclaims. See, e.g., Iqbal, 556 U. S., at 675. We do so again\nin this case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10–11 (counsel for peti-\ntioners observed that the implication of a right to sue\nderived from the First Amendment itself was an issue “not\npreserved below” and therefore “not presented” in this\nCourt).\n   The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government\nofficials from liability for civil damages “unless a plaintiff\n12                          WOOD v. MOSS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statu-\ntory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was\n‘clearly established’ at the time of the challenged conduct.”\nAshcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n3). And under the governing pleading standard, the “com-\nplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as\ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”\nIqbal, 556 U. S., at 678 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Requiring the alleged violation of law to be “clearly\nestablished” “balances . . . the need to hold public officials\naccountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and\nthe need to shield officials from harassment, distraction,\nand liability when they perform their duties reasonably.”\nPearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 231 (2009). The “dis-\npositive inquiry,” we have said, “is whether it would [have\nbeen] clear to a reasonable officer” in the agents’ position\n“that [their] conduct was unlawful in the situation [they]\nconfronted.” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 202 (2001).\n   At the time of the Jacksonville incident, this Court had\naddressed a constitutional challenge to Secret Service\nactions on only one occasion.6 In Hunter v. Bryant, 502\nU. S. 224 (1991) (per curiam), the plaintiff sued two Secret\nService agents alleging that they arrested him without\nprobable cause for writing and delivering to two Univer-\nsity of Southern California offices a letter referring to a\nplot to assassinate President Ronald Reagan. We held that\nqualified immunity shielded the agents from claims that\nthe arrest violated the plaintiff ’s rights under the Fourth,\nFifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. “[N]owhere,”\nwe stated, is “accommodation for reasonable error . . .\n——————\n  6 Subsequent to the incident at issue here, we held in Reichle v.

But, the court determined, no\nreason was shown for “the considerable disparity in the\ndistance each group was allowed to stand from the Presi-\ndential party.” Ibid. The agents thus offended the First\nAmendment, in the Court of Appeals’ view, because their\ndirections to the local officers placed the protesters at a\n“comparativ[e] disadvantag[e] in expressing their views”\nto the President. Ibid.\n  No decision of which we are aware, however, would alert\nSecret Service agents engaged in crowd control that they\nbear a First Amendment obligation “to ensure that groups\nwith different viewpoints are at comparable locations at\nall times.” Id., at 952 (O’Scannlain, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc). Nor would the maintenance\nof equal access make sense in the situation the agents\nconfronted.\n  Recall that at the protesters’ location on the north side\nof California Street, see supra, at 4, they faced an alley\ngiving them a direct line of sight to the outdoor patio\nwhere the President stopped to dine. The first move, to\nthe corner of Fourth and California Streets, proved no\nsolution, for there, only a parking lot stood between the\nprotesters and the patio. True, at both locations, a six-foot\nwooden fence and an unspecified number of local police\nofficers impeded access to the President. Even so, 200 to\n300 protesters were within weapons range, and had a\nlargely unobstructed view, of the President’s location. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 41 (counsel for respondents acknowledged\nthat “in hindsight, you could . . . conclude” that “proximity\n[of the protesters to the President] alone . . . is enough to\ncreate a security [risk]”).

See App. Pet. for Cert.\n178a. As earlier explained, however, see supra, at 4–5,\nthere would have been no security rationale for such a\nmove. In contrast to the open alley and parking lot on the\neast side of the Inn, to the west of the Inn where the sup-\nporters stood, a large, two-story building blocked sight of,\nor weapons access to, the patio the agents endeavored to\nsecure.8 No clearly established law, we agree, required the\nSecret Service “to interfere with even more speech than\nsecurity concerns would require in an attempt to keep\nopposing groups at roughly equal distances from the Pres-\nident.” Brief for Petitioners 32. And surely no such law\nrequired the agents to attempt to maintain equal dis-\ntances by “prevail[ing] upon the President not to dine at the\nInn.” Oral Arg. Audio in No. 10–36152 (CA9) 42:22 to 43:36\n(argument by protesters’ counsel), available at http://\nwww.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view.php?pk_id=0000008129.\n(as visited May 19, 2014, and in Clerk of Court’s case file)\n(argument tendered by protesters’ counsel).\n                          III\n  The protesters allege that, when the agents directed\ntheir displacement, the agents acted not to ensure the\nPresident’s safety from handguns or explosive devices.\n——————\n  8 Neither side contends that the presence of demonstrators along the\n\nPresident’s motorcade route posed an unmanageable security risk, or\nthat there would have been a legitimate security rationale for removing\nthe protesters, but not the supporters, from the motorcade route. The\nPresident’s detour for dinner, however, set the two groups apart. “[T]he\nsecurity concerns arising from the presence of a large group of people\nnear the open-air patio where the President was dining were plainly\ndifferent from those associated with permitting a group . . . to remain\nalong Third Street while the President’s [armored limousine] traveled\nby.” Brief for Petitioners 46.\n16                     WOOD v. MOSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nInstead, the protesters urge, the agents had them moved\nsolely to insulate the President from their message, thereby\ngiving the President’s supporters greater visibility and\naudibility. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35–36. The Ninth Circuit\nfound sufficient the protesters’ allegations that the agents\n“acted with the sole intent to discriminate against [the\nprotesters] because of their viewpoint”. 711 F. 3d, at 964.\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals “allow[ed] the protes-\ntors’ claim of viewpoint discrimination to proceed.” Id., at\n962.\n   It may be, the agents acknowledged, that clearly estab-\nlished law proscribed the Secret Service from disadvantag-\ning one group of speakers in comparison to another if the\nagents had “no objectively reasonable security rationale”\nfor their conduct, but acted solely to inhibit the expression\nof disfavored views. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–29; Brief for\nPetitioners 52 (entitlement to relief might have been\nestablished if, for example, “the pro-Bush group had . . .\nbeen allowed to move into the nearer location that the\nanti-Bush had vacated”). We agree with the agents, how-\never, that the map itself, reproduced supra, at 4, under-\nmines the protesters’ allegations of viewpoint discrimina-\ntion as the sole reason for the agents’ directions. The map\ncorroborates that, because of their location, the protesters\nposed a potential security risk to the President, while the\nsupporters, because of their location, did not.\n   The protesters make three arguments to shore up their\ncharge that the agents’ asserted security concerns are\ndisingenuous. First, the protesters urge that, had the\nagents’ professed interest in the President’s safety been\nsincere, the agents would have directed all persons pres-\nent at the Inn to be screened or removed from the prem-\nises. See Brief for Respondents 27. But staff, other din-\ners, and Inn guests were there even before the agents\nthemselves knew that the President would dine at the Inn.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 47. Those already at the Inn\n                      Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n“could not have had any expectation that they would see\nthe President that evening or any opportunity to premedi-\ntate a plan to cause him harm.” Reply Brief 16. The\nSecret Service, moreover, could take measures to ensure\nthat the relatively small number of people already inside\nthe Inn were kept under close watch; no similar surveil-\nlance would have been possible for 200 to 300 people\ncongregating in front of the Inn. See ibid.\n   The protesters also point to a White House manual,\nwhich states that the President’s advance team should\n“work with the Secret Service . . . to designate a protest\narea . . . preferably not in view of the event site or motor-\ncade route.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 219a. This manual\nguides the conduct of the President’s political advance\nteam. See id., at 220a (distinguishing between the politi-\ncal role of the advance team and the security mission of\nthe Secret Service).9 As the complaint acknowledges, the\nSecret Service has its own “written guidelines, directives,\ninstructions and rules.” Id., at 184a. Those guides explic-\nitly “prohibit Secret Service agents from discriminating\nbetween anti-government and pro-government demonstra-\ntors.” Ibid.\n   The protesters maintain that the Secret Service does not\nadhere to its own written guides. They recite several\ninstances in which Secret Service agents allegedly en-\ngaged in viewpoint discrimination. See id., at 189a–194a.\nEven accepting as true the submission that Secret Service\nagents, at times, have assisted in shielding the President\nfrom political speech, this case is scarcely one in which the\nagents acted “without a valid security reason.” Brief for\n——————\n   9 “An ‘advance man’ is ‘[o]ne who arranges for publicity, protocol,\n\ntransportation, speaking schedules, conferences with local government\nofficials, and minute details of a visit, smoothing the way for a political\nfigure.’ ” See 711 F. 3d, at 950, n. 2 (O’Scannlain, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc) (quoting W. Safire, Safire’s Political\nDictionary 8 (5th ed. 2008)).\n18                      WOOD v. MOSS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nRespondents 40. We emphasize, again, that the protesters\nwere at least as close to the President as were the sup-\nporters when the motorcade arrived at the Jacksonville\nInn. See supra, at 5. And as the map attached to the\ncomplaint shows, see supra, at 4, when the President\nreached the patio to dine, the protesters, but not the sup-\nporters, were within weapons range of his location. See\nsupra, at 14. Given that situation, the protesters cannot\nplausibly urge that the agents “had no valid security\nreason to request or order the[ir] eviction.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 186a.\n  We note, moreover, that individual government officials\n“cannot be held liable” in a Bivens suit “unless they them-\nselves acted [unconstitutionally].” Iqbal, 556 U. S., at 683.\nWe therefore decline to infer from alleged instances of\nmisconduct on the part of particular agents an unwritten\npolicy of the Secret Service to suppress disfavored expres-\nsion, and then to attribute that supposed policy to all field-\nlevel operatives. See Reply Brief 20.\n                        *    *     *\n  This case comes to us on the agents’ petition to review\nthe Ninth Circuit’s denial of their qualified immunity\ndefense. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10 (petitioners’ briefing on\nappeal trained on the issue of qualified immunity). Limit-\ning our decision to that question, we hold, for the reasons\nstated, that the agents are entitled to qualified immunity.\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2675749/", "sha1": "f3905125f953d854ff8e7cc4eac1907d458da559", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-047", "time_retrieved": "2014-05-27T08:00:53.395907"}
