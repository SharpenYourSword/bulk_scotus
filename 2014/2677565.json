Argued January 14, 2014—Decided June 9, 2014\nBellingham Insurance Agency, Inc. (BIA), filed a voluntary chapter 7\n  bankruptcy petition. Respondent Peter Arkison, the bankruptcy\n  trustee, filed a complaint in the Bankruptcy Court against petitioner\n  Executive Benefits Insurance Agency (EBIA) and others alleging the\n  fraudulent conveyance of assets from BIA to EBIA. The Bankruptcy\n  Court granted summary judgment for the trustee. EBIA appealed to\n  the District Court, which affirmed the Bankruptcy Court’s decision\n  after de novo review and entered judgment for the trustee. While\n  EBIA’s appeal to the Ninth Circuit was pending, this Court held that\n  Article III did not permit a Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment\n  on a counterclaim for tortious interference, even though final\n  adjudication of that claim by the Bankruptcy Court was authorized\n  by statute. Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, ___. In light of Stern,\n  EBIA moved to dismiss its appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Ninth\n  Circuit rejected EBIA’s motion and affirmed. It acknowledged the\n  trustee’s claims as “Stern claims,” i.e., claims designated for final\n  adjudication in the bankruptcy court as a statutory matter, but\n  prohibited from proceeding in that way as a constitutional matter.\n  The Court of Appeals nevertheless concluded that EBIA had\n  impliedly consented to jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals also\n  observed that the Bankruptcy Court’s judgment could instead be\n  treated as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, subject to\n  de novo review by the District Court.\nHeld:\n    1. Under the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act\n2         EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    of 1984, federal district courts have original jurisdiction in\n    bankruptcy cases and may refer to bankruptcy judges two statutory\n    categories of proceedings: “core” proceedings and “non-core”\n    proceedings. See generally 28 U. S. C. §157. In core proceedings, a\n    bankruptcy judge “may hear and determine . . . and enter\n    appropriate orders and judgments,” subject to the district court’s\n    traditional appellate review. §157(b)(1). In non-core proceedings—\n    those that are “not . . . core” but are “otherwise related to a case\n    under title 11,” §157(c)(1)—final judgment must be entered by the\n    district court after de novo review of the bankruptcy judge’s proposed\n    findings of fact and conclusions of law, ibid., except that the\n    bankruptcy judge may enter final judgment if the parties consent,\n    §157(c)(2).\n       In Stern, the Court confronted an underlying conflict between the\n    1984 Act and the requirements of Article III. The Court held that\n    Article III prohibits Congress from vesting a bankruptcy court with\n    the authority to finally adjudicate the “core” claim of tortious\n    interference. The Court did not, however, address how courts should\n    proceed when they encounter a Stern claim. Pp. 4–8.\n       2. Stern claims may proceed as non-core within the meaning of\n    §157(c). Lower courts have described Stern claims as creating a\n    statutory “gap,” since bankruptcy judges are not explicitly authorized\n    to propose findings of fact and conclusions of law in a core proceeding.\n    However, this so-called gap is closed by the Act’s severability\n    provision, which instructs that where a “provision of the Act or [its]\n    application . . . is held invalid, the remainder of th[e] Act . . . is not\n    affected thereby.” 98 Stat. 344. As applicable here, when a court\n    identifies a Stern claim, it has “held invalid” the “application” of\n    §157(b), and the “remainder” not affected includes §157(c), which\n    governs non-core proceedings. Accordingly, where a claim otherwise\n    satisfies §157(c)(1), the bankruptcy court should simply treat the\n    Stern claim as non-core. This conclusion accords with the Court’s\n    general approach to severability, which is to give effect to the valid\n    portion of a statute so long as it “remains ‘fully operative as a law,’ ”\n    Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.,\n    561 U. S. 477, 509, and so long as the statutory text and context do\n    not suggest that Congress would have preferred no statute at all,\n    ibid. Pp. 8–10.\n       3. Section 157(c)(1)’s procedures apply to the fraudulent\n    conveyance claims here. This Court assumes without deciding that\n    these claims are Stern claims, which Article III does not permit to be\n    treated as “core” claims under §157(b). But because the claims assert\n    that property of the bankruptcy estate was improperly removed, they\n    are self-evidently “related to a case under title 11.” Accordingly, they\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  fit comfortably within the category of claims governed by §157(c)(1).\n  The Bankruptcy Court would have been permitted to follow that\n  provision’s procedures, i.e., to submit proposed findings of fact and\n  conclusions of law to the District Court for de novo review. Pp. 11–\n  12.\n     4. Here, the District Court’s de novo review of the Bankruptcy\n  Court’s order and entry of its own valid final judgment cured any\n  potential error in the Bankruptcy Court’s entry of judgment. EBIA\n  contends that it was constitutionally entitled to review by an Article\n  III court regardless of whether the parties consented to bankruptcy\n  court adjudication. In the alternative, EBIA asserts that even if such\n  consent were constitutionally permissible, it did not in fact consent.\n  Neither contention need be addressed here, because EBIA received\n  the same review from the District Court that it would have received\n  had the Bankruptcy Court treated the claims as non-core proceedings\n  under §157(c)(1).

PETER H.

Marshall, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), this Court\nheld that even though bankruptcy courts are statutorily\nauthorized to enter final judgment on a class of bankruptcy-\nrelated claims, Article III of the Constitution prohibits\nbankruptcy courts from finally adjudicating certain of\nthose claims. Stern did not, however, decide how bank-\nruptcy or district courts should proceed when a “Stern\nclaim” is identified. We hold today that when, under\nStern’s reasoning, the Constitution does not permit a\nbankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a bankruptcy-\nrelated claim, the relevant statute nevertheless permits a\nbankruptcy court to issue proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law to be reviewed de novo by the district\ncourt. Because the District Court in this case conducted\nthe de novo review that petitioner demands, we affirm the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals upholding the District\nCourt’s decision.\n2       EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n   Nicolas Paleveda and his wife owned and operated two\ncompanies—Aegis Retirement Income Services, Inc.\n(ARIS), and Bellingham Insurance Agency, Inc. (BIA). By\nearly 2006, BIA had become insolvent, and on January 31,\n2006, the company ceased operation. The next day,\nPaleveda used BIA funds to incorporate Executive Bene-\nfits Insurance Agency, Inc. (EBIA), petitioner in this case.\nPaleveda and others initiated a scheme to transfer assets\nfrom BIA to EBIA. The assets were deposited into an\naccount held jointly by ARIS and EBIA and ultimately\ncredited to EBIA at the end of the year.\n   On June 1, 2006, BIA filed a voluntary Chapter 7 bank-\nruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for\nthe Western District of Washington. Peter Arkison, the\nbankruptcy trustee and respondent in this case, filed a\ncomplaint in the same Bankruptcy Court against EBIA\nand others. As relevant here, the complaint alleged that\nPaleveda used various methods to fraudulently convey\nBIA assets to EBIA.1 EBIA filed an answer and denied\nmany of the trustee’s allegations.\n   After some disagreement as to whether the trustee’s\nclaims should continue in the Bankruptcy Court or instead\nproceed before a jury in Federal District Court, the trustee\nfiled a motion for summary judgment against EBIA in the\nBankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court granted sum-\nmary judgment for the trustee on all claims, including the\nfraudulent conveyance claims. EBIA then appealed that\ndetermination to the District Court. The District Court\nconducted de novo review, affirmed the Bankruptcy\nCourt’s decision, and entered judgment for the trustee.\n   EBIA appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit. After EBIA filed its opening brief, this\n——————\n  1 The trustee asserted claims of fraudulent conveyance under 11\n\nU. S. C. §544, and under state law, Wash. Rev.

In Stern, we held that Article\nIII of the Constitution did not permit a bankruptcy court\nto enter final judgment on a counterclaim for tortious\ninterference, id., at ___, even though final adjudication of\nthat claim by the Bankruptcy Court was authorized by\nstatute, see Part II–B, infra.2 In light of Stern, EBIA\nmoved to dismiss its appeal in the Ninth Circuit for lack of\njurisdiction, contending that Article III did not permit\nCongress to vest authority in a bankruptcy court to finally\ndecide the trustee’s fraudulent conveyance claims.\n   The Ninth Circuit rejected EBIA’s motion and affirmed\nthe District Court. In re Bellingham Ins. Agency, Inc., 702\nF. 3d 553 (2012). As relevant here, the court held that\nStern, supra, and Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492\nU. S. 33 (1989),3 taken together, lead to the conclusion\nthat Article III does not permit a bankruptcy court to\nenter final judgment on a fraudulent conveyance claim\nagainst a noncreditor unless the parties consent. 702\nF. 3d, at 565. The Ninth Circuit concluded that EBIA had\nimpliedly consented to the Bankruptcy Court’s jurisdic-\ntion, and that the Bankruptcy Court’s adjudication of the\nfraudulent conveyance claim was therefore permissible.\nId., at 566, 568. The Court of Appeals also observed that\nthe Bankruptcy Court’s judgment could instead be treated\nas proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, subject\nto de novo review by the District Court. Id., at 565–566.\n   We granted certiorari, 570 U. S. ___ (2013).\n——————\n   2 As we explain below, see Part II–B, infra, the statutory scheme\n\nat issue both in Stern and in this case grants bankruptcy courts the\nauthority to “hear and determine” and “enter appropriate orders and\njudgments” in “core” proceedings. 28 U. S. C. §157(b)(1). The statute\nlists counterclaims like the one brought in Stern as “core” claims.\n§157(b)(2)(C).\n   3 Granfinanciera held that a fraudulent conveyance claim under Title\n\n11 is not a matter of “public right” for purposes of Article III, 492 U. S.,\nat 55, and that the defendant to such a claim is entitled to a jury trial\nunder the Seventh Amendment, id., at 64.\n4       EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              II\n\n   In Stern, we held that Article III prohibits Congress\nfrom vesting a bankruptcy court with the authority to\nfinally adjudicate certain claims. 564 U. S., at ___. But\nwe did not address how courts should proceed when they\nencounter one of these “Stern claims”—a claim designated\nfor final adjudication in the bankruptcy court as a statu-\ntory matter, but prohibited from proceeding in that way as\na constitutional matter.4\n   As we explain in greater detail below, when a bankruptcy\ncourt is presented with such a claim, the proper course\nis to issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nThe district court will then review the claim de novo and\nenter judgment. This approach accords with the bank-\nruptcy statute and does not implicate the constitutional\ndefect identified by Stern.\n                               A\n  We begin with an overview of modern bankruptcy legis-\nlation. Prior to 1978, federal district courts could refer\nmatters within the traditional “summary jurisdiction” of\nbankruptcy courts to specialized bankruptcy referees.5\nSee Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line\nCo., 458 U. S. 50, 53 (1982) (plurality opinion). Summary\njurisdiction covered claims involving “property in the\nactual or constructive possession of the [bankruptcy]\ncourt,” ibid., i.e., claims regarding the apportionment of\n——————\n  4 Because we conclude that EBIA received the de novo review and\n\nentry of judgment to which it claims constitutional entitlement, see\nPart IV–B, infra, this case does not require us to address whether EBIA\nin fact consented to the Bankruptcy Court’s adjudication of a Stern\nclaim and whether Article III permits a bankruptcy court, with the\nconsent of the parties, to enter final judgment on a Stern claim. We\nreserve that question for another day.\n  5 Bankruptcy referees were designated “judges” in 1973. See North-\n\nern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 53,\nn. 2 (1982) (plurality opinion).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe existing bankruptcy estate among creditors. See\nBrubaker, A “Summary” Statutory and Constitutional\nTheory of Bankruptcy Judges’ Core Jurisdiction After\nStern v. Marshall, 86 Am. Bankr. L. J. 121, 124 (2012).\nProceedings to augment the bankruptcy estate, on the\nother hand, implicated the district court’s plenary jurisdic-\ntion and were not referred to the bankruptcy courts absent\nboth parties’ consent. See MacDonald v. Plymouth County\nTrust Co., 286 U. S. 263, 266 (1932); see also Brubaker,\nsupra, at 128.\n   In 1978, Congress enacted sweeping changes to the\nfederal bankruptcy laws. See 92 Stat. 2549. The Bank-\nruptcy Reform Act eliminated the historical distinction\nbetween “ ‘summary’ ” jurisdiction belonging to bankruptcy\ncourts and “ ‘plenary’ ” jurisdiction belonging to either a\ndistrict court or an appropriate state court. Northern\nPipeline, supra, at 54 (plurality opinion); see also 1 W.\nNorton & W. Norton Bankruptcy Law and Practice §4:12,\np. 4–44 (3d ed. 2013). Instead, the 1978 Act mandated\nthat bankruptcy judges “shall exercise” jurisdiction over\n“all civil proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or\nrelated to cases under title 11.” 28 U. S. C. §§1471(b)–(c)\n(1976 ed., Supp. IV). Under the 1978 Act, bankruptcy\njudges were “vested with all of the ‘powers of a court of\nequity, law, and admiralty,’ ” with only a few limited ex-\nceptions. Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 55 (plurality\nopinion) (quoting §1481). Notwithstanding their expanded\njurisdiction and authority, these bankruptcy judges were\nnot afforded the protections of Article III—namely, life\ntenure and a salary that may not be diminished. Id.,\nat 53.\n   In Northern Pipeline, this Court addressed whether\nbankruptcy judges under the 1978 Act could “constitution-\nally be vested with jurisdiction to decide [a] state-law\ncontract claim” against an entity not otherwise a party to\nthe proceeding. Id., at 53, 87, n. 40. The Court concluded\n6       EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthat assignment of that claim for resolution by the bank-\nruptcy judge “violates Art. III of the Constitution.” Id., at\n52, 87 (plurality opinion); see id., at 91 (Rehnquist, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). The Court distinguished be-\ntween cases involving so-called “public rights,” which may\nbe removed from the jurisdiction of Article III courts, and\ncases involving “private rights,” which may not. See id., at\n69–71 (plurality opinion); id., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concur-\nring in judgment). Specifically, the plurality noted that\n“the restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is at\nthe core of the federal bankruptcy power, must be distin-\nguished from the adjudication of state-created private\nrights,” which belong in an Article III court. Id., at 71–72,\nand n. 26.\n                              B\n   Against that historical backdrop, Congress enacted the\nBankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of\n1984—the Act at issue in this case. See 28 U. S. C. §151\net seq. Under the 1984 Act, federal district courts have\n“original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title\n11,” §1334(a), and may refer to bankruptcy judges any\n“proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related\nto a case under title 11,” §157(a).6 Bankruptcy judges\nserve 14-year terms subject to removal for cause,\n§§152(a)(1), (e), and their salaries are set by Congress,\n§153(a).\n   The 1984 Act largely restored the bifurcated jurisdic-\ntional scheme that existed prior to the 1978 Act. The 1984\nAct implements that bifurcated scheme by dividing all\nmatters that may be referred to the bankruptcy court\ninto two categories: “core” and “non-core” proceedings. See\ngenerally §157.7 It is the bankruptcy court’s responsibility\n——————\n  6 In addition, district courts may also withdraw such matters from the\n\nbankruptcy courts for “cause shown.” §157(d).\n  7 In using the term “core,” Congress tracked the Northern Pipeline\n                      Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto determine whether each claim before it is core or non-\ncore. §157(b)(3); cf. Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7012. For core\nproceedings, the statute contains a nonexhaustive list of\nexamples, including—as relevant here—“proceedings to\ndetermine, avoid, or recover fraudulent conveyances.”\n§157(b)(2)(H). The statute authorizes bankruptcy judges\nto “hear and determine” such claims and “enter appropri-\nate orders and judgments” on them. §157(b)(1). A final\njudgment entered in a core proceeding is appealable to the\ndistrict court, §158(a)(1), which reviews the judgment\nunder traditional appellate standards, Rule 8013.\n   As for “non-core” proceedings—i.e., proceedings that are\n“not . . . core” but are “otherwise related to a case under\ntitle 11”—the statute authorizes a bankruptcy court to\n“hear [the] proceeding,” and then “submit proposed find-\nings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.”\n§157(c)(1). The district court must then review those\nproposed findings and conclusions de novo and enter any\nfinal orders or judgments. Ibid. There is one statutory\nexception to this rule: If all parties “consent,” the statute\npermits the bankruptcy judge “to hear and determine and\nto enter appropriate orders and judgments” as if the pro-\nceeding were core. §157(c)(2).\n   Put simply: If a matter is core, the statute empowers the\nbankruptcy judge to enter final judgment on the claim,\nsubject to appellate review by the district court. If a mat-\nter is non-core, and the parties have not consented to final\nadjudication by the bankruptcy court, the bankruptcy\njudge must propose findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nThen, the district court must review the proceeding\nde novo and enter final judgment.\n——————\nplurality’s use of the same term as a description of those claims that fell\nwithin the scope of the historical bankruptcy court’s power. See 458\nU. S., at 71 (“[T]he restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is\nat the core of the federal bankruptcy power, must be distinguished from\nthe adjudication of state-created private rights . . .” (emphasis added)).\n8      EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               C\n\n  Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, confronted an underly-\ning conflict between the 1984 Act and the requirements of\nArticle III. In particular, Stern considered a constitutional\nchallenge to the statutory designation of a particular claim\nas “core.” The bankrupt in that case had filed a common-\nlaw counterclaim for tortious interference against a credi-\ntor to the estate. Id., at ___. Section 157(b)(2)(C), as\nadded by the 1984 Act, lists “counterclaims by the estate\nagainst persons filing claims against the estate” as a core\nproceeding, thereby authorizing the bankruptcy court to\nadjudicate the claim to final judgment. See supra this\npage. The respondent in Stern objected that Congress had\nviolated Article III by vesting the power to adjudicate the\ntortious interference counterclaim in bankruptcy court.\nStern, 564 U. S., at ___.\n  We agreed. Id., at ___. In that circumstance, we held,\nCongress had improperly vested the Bankruptcy Court\nwith the “ ‘ judicial Power of the United States,’ ” just as in\nNorthern Pipeline. 564 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 21,\n38). Because “[n]o ‘public right’ exception excuse[d] the\nfailure to comply with Article III,” we concluded that\nCongress could not confer on the Bankruptcy Court the\nauthority to finally decide the claim. Id., at ___. (slip op.,\nat 21).\n                            III\n  Stern made clear that some claims labeled by Congress\nas “core” may not be adjudicated by a bankruptcy court in\nthe manner designated by §157(b). Stern did not, how-\never, address how the bankruptcy court should proceed\nunder those circumstances. We turn to that question now.\n  The Ninth Circuit held that the fraudulent conveyance\nclaims at issue here are Stern claims—that is, proceedings\nthat are defined as “core” under §157(b) but may not, as a\nconstitutional matter, be adjudicated as such (at least in\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

By definition, a Stern\nclaim may not be adjudicated to final judgment by the\nbankruptcy court, as in a typical core proceeding. But the\nalternative procedure, whereby the bankruptcy court\nsubmits proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,\napplies only to non-core claims. See §157(c)(1). Because\n§157(b) does not explicitly authorize bankruptcy judges to\nsubmit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in\na core proceeding, the argument goes, Stern created a\n“gap” in the bankruptcy statute. See 702 F. 3d, at 565.\nThat gap purportedly renders the bankruptcy court power-\nless to act on Stern claims, see Brief for Petitioner 46–48,\nthus requiring the district court to hear all Stern claims in\nthe first instance.\n  We disagree. The statute permits Stern claims to pro-\nceed as non-core within the meaning of §157(c). In partic-\nular, the statute contains a severability provision that\naccounts for decisions, like Stern, that invalidate certain\napplications of the statute:\n    “If any provision of this Act or the application thereof\n    to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the re-\n    mainder of this Act, or the application of that provi-\n    sion to persons or circumstances other than those as\n    to which it is held invalid, is not affected thereby.” 98\n    Stat. 344, note following 28 U. S. C. §151.\n  The plain text of this severability provision closes the\nso-called “gap” created by Stern claims. When a court\nidentifies a claim as a Stern claim, it has necessarily “held\ninvalid” the “application” of §157(b)—i.e., the “core” label\nand its attendant procedures—to the litigant’s claim.\nNote following §151. In that circumstance, the statute\n10       EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninstructs that “the remainder of th[e] Act . . . is not affected\nthereby.” Ibid. That remainder includes §157(c), which\ngoverns non-core proceedings. With the “core” category no\nlonger available for the Stern claim at issue, we look to\n§157(c)(1) to determine whether the claim may be adjudi-\ncated as a non-core claim—specifically, whether it is “not a\ncore proceeding” but is “otherwise related to a case under\ntitle 11.” If the claim satisfies the criteria of §157(c)(1),\nthe bankruptcy court simply treats the claims as non-core:\nThe bankruptcy court should hear the proceeding and\nsubmit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law\nto the district court for de novo review and entry of\njudgment.\n   The conclusion that the remainder of the statute may\ncontinue to apply to Stern claims accords with our general\napproach to severability. We ordinarily give effect to the\nvalid portion of a partially unconstitutional statute so long\nas it “remains ‘ “fully operative as a law,” ’ ” Free Enterprise\nFund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561\nU. S. 477, 509 (2010) (quoting New York v. United States,\n505 U. S. 144, 186 (1992)), and so long as it is not “ ‘evi-\ndent’ ” from the statutory text and context that Congress\nwould have preferred no statute at all, 561 U. S., at 509\n(quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684\n(1987)). Neither of those concerns applies here. Thus,\n§157(c) may be applied naturally to Stern claims. And,\nEBIA has identified “nothing in the statute’s text or his-\ntorical context” that makes it “evident” that Congress\nwould prefer to suspend Stern claims in limbo. 561 U. S.,\nat 509.8\n——————\n  8 To the contrary, we noted in Stern that removal of claims from core\n\nbankruptcy jurisdiction does not “meaningfully chang[e] the division of\nlabor in the current statute.” 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 37). Accept-\ning EBIA’s contention that district courts are required to hear all Stern\nclaims in the first instance, see Brief for Petitioner 46–48, would\ndramatically alter the division of responsibility set by Congress.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   Now we must determine whether the procedures set\nforth in §157(c)(1) apply to the fraudulent conveyance\nclaims at issue in this case. The Court of Appeals held,\nand we assume without deciding, that the fraudulent\nconveyance claims in this case are Stern claims. See Part\nIII, supra. For purposes of this opinion, the “application”\nof both the “core” label and the procedures of §157(b) to\nthe trustee’s claims has therefore been “held invalid.”\nNote following §151. Accordingly, we must decide whether\nthe fraudulent conveyance claims brought by the trustee\nare within the scope of §157(c)(1)—that is, “not . . . core”\nproceedings but “otherwise related to a case under title\n11.” We hold that this language encompasses the trustee’s\nclaims of fraudulent conveyance.\n   First, the fraudulent conveyance claims in this case are\n“not . . . core.” The Ninth Circuit held—and no party\ndisputes—that Article III does not permit these claims to\nbe treated as “core.” See Part III, supra. Second, the\nfraudulent conveyance claims are self-evidently “related to\na case under title 11.” At bottom, a fraudulent conveyance\nclaim asserts that property that should have been part of\nthe bankruptcy estate and therefore available for distribu-\ntion to creditors pursuant to Title 11 was improperly\nremoved. That sort of claim is “related to a case under\ntitle 11” under any plausible construction of the statutory\ntext, and no party contends otherwise. See, e.g., Celotex\nCorp. v. Edwards, 514 U. S. 300, 307, n. 5, 308 (1995)\n(“Proceedings ‘related to’ the bankruptcy include . . . suits\nbetween third parties which have an effect on the bank-\nruptcy estate”). Accordingly, because these Stern claims\nfit comfortably within the category of claims governed by\n§157(c)(1), the Bankruptcy Court would have been permit-\nted to follow the procedures required by that provision,\ni.e., to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of\n12     EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw to the District Court to be reviewed de novo.\n                               B\n   Although this case did not proceed in precisely that\nfashion, we affirm nonetheless. A brief procedural history\nof the case helps explain why.\n   As noted, §157 permits a bankruptcy court to adjudicate\na claim to final judgment in two circumstances—in core\nproceedings, see §157(b), and in non-core proceedings\n“with the consent of all the parties,” §157(c)(2). In this\ncase, the Bankruptcy Court entered judgment in favor of\nthe bankruptcy trustee without specifying in its order\nwhether it was acting pursuant to §157(b) (core) or\n§157(c)(2) (non-core with consent). EBIA immediately\nappealed to the District Court, see §158, but it did not\nargue that the Bankruptcy Court lacked constitutional\nauthority to grant summary judgment. As a result, the\nDistrict Court did not analyze whether there was a Stern\nproblem and did not, as some district courts have done,\nrelabel the bankruptcy order as mere proposed findings of\nfact and conclusions of law. See, e.g., In re Parco Merged\nMedia Corp., 489 B. R. 323, 326 (Me. 2013) (collecting\ncases). The District Court did, however, review de novo\nthe Bankruptcy Court’s grant of summary judgment for\nthe trustee—a legal question—and issued a reasoned\nopinion affirming the Bankruptcy Court. The District\nCourt then separately entered judgment in favor of the\ntrustee. See 28 U. S. C. §1334(b) (“[T]he district courts\nshall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil\nproceedings . . . related to cases under title 11”).\n   EBIA now objects on constitutional grounds to the\nBankruptcy Court’s disposition of the fraudulent convey-\nance claims. EBIA contends that it was constitutionally\nentitled to review of its fraudulent conveyance claims by\nan Article III court regardless of whether the parties\nconsented to adjudication by a bankruptcy court. Brief for\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner 25–27. In an alternative argument, EBIA\nasserts that even if the Constitution permitted the Bank-\nruptcy Court to adjudicate its claim with the consent of\nthe parties, it did not in fact consent. Id., at 38.\n   In light of the procedural posture of this case, however,\nwe need not decide whether EBIA’s contentions are correct\non either score. At bottom, EBIA argues that it was enti-\ntled to have an Article III court review de novo and enter\njudgment on the fraudulent conveyance claims asserted by\nthe trustee. In effect, EBIA received exactly that. The\nDistrict Court conducted de novo review of the summary\njudgment claims, concluding in a written opinion that\nthere were no disputed issues of material fact and that the\ntrustee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In\naccordance with its statutory authority over matters\nrelated to the bankruptcy, see §1334(b), the District Court\nthen separately entered judgment in favor of the trustee.\nEBIA thus received the same review from the District\nCourt that it would have received if the Bankruptcy Court\nhad treated the fraudulent conveyance claims as non-core\nproceedings under §157(c)(1). In short, even if EBIA is\ncorrect that the Bankruptcy Court’s entry of judgment was\ninvalid, the District Court’s de novo review and entry of its\nown valid final judgment cured any error. Cf. Carter v.\nKubler, 320 U. S. 243, 248 (1943) (bankruptcy commis-\nsioner’s error was cured after the District Court “made\nan independent and complete review of the conflicting\nevidence”).\n   Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 2677565, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/06/09/executive_benefits_ins._agency_v._arkison.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 14, 2014—Decided June 9, 2014\nBellingham Insurance Agency, Inc. (BIA), filed a voluntary chapter 7\n  bankruptcy petition. Respondent Peter Arkison, the bankruptcy\n  trustee, filed a complaint in the Bankruptcy Court against petitioner\n  Executive Benefits Insurance Agency (EBIA) and others alleging the\n  fraudulent conveyance of assets from BIA to EBIA. The Bankruptcy\n  Court granted summary judgment for the trustee. EBIA appealed to\n  the District Court, which affirmed the Bankruptcy Court’s decision\n  after de novo review and entered judgment for the trustee. While\n  EBIA’s appeal to the Ninth Circuit was pending, this Court held that\n  Article III did not permit a Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment\n  on a counterclaim for tortious interference, even though final\n  adjudication of that claim by the Bankruptcy Court was authorized\n  by statute. Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, ___. In light of Stern,\n  EBIA moved to dismiss its appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Ninth\n  Circuit rejected EBIA’s motion and affirmed. It acknowledged the\n  trustee’s claims as “Stern claims,” i.e., claims designated for final\n  adjudication in the bankruptcy court as a statutory matter, but\n  prohibited from proceeding in that way as a constitutional matter.\n  The Court of Appeals nevertheless concluded that EBIA had\n  impliedly consented to jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals also\n  observed that the Bankruptcy Court’s judgment could instead be\n  treated as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, subject to\n  de novo review by the District Court.\nHeld:\n    1. Under the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act\n2         EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    of 1984, federal district courts have original jurisdiction in\n    bankruptcy cases and may refer to bankruptcy judges two statutory\n    categories of proceedings: “core” proceedings and “non-core”\n    proceedings. See generally 28 U. S. C. §157. In core proceedings, a\n    bankruptcy judge “may hear and determine . . . and enter\n    appropriate orders and judgments,” subject to the district court’s\n    traditional appellate review. §157(b)(1). In non-core proceedings—\n    those that are “not . . . core” but are “otherwise related to a case\n    under title 11,” §157(c)(1)—final judgment must be entered by the\n    district court after de novo review of the bankruptcy judge’s proposed\n    findings of fact and conclusions of law, ibid., except that the\n    bankruptcy judge may enter final judgment if the parties consent,\n    §157(c)(2).\n       In Stern, the Court confronted an underlying conflict between the\n    1984 Act and the requirements of Article III. The Court held that\n    Article III prohibits Congress from vesting a bankruptcy court with\n    the authority to finally adjudicate the “core” claim of tortious\n    interference. The Court did not, however, address how courts should\n    proceed when they encounter a Stern claim. Pp. 4–8.\n       2. Stern claims may proceed as non-core within the meaning of\n    §157(c). Lower courts have described Stern claims as creating a\n    statutory “gap,” since bankruptcy judges are not explicitly authorized\n    to propose findings of fact and conclusions of law in a core proceeding.\n    However, this so-called gap is closed by the Act’s severability\n    provision, which instructs that where a “provision of the Act or [its]\n    application . . . is held invalid, the remainder of th[e] Act . . . is not\n    affected thereby.” 98 Stat. 344. As applicable here, when a court\n    identifies a Stern claim, it has “held invalid” the “application” of\n    §157(b), and the “remainder” not affected includes §157(c), which\n    governs non-core proceedings. Accordingly, where a claim otherwise\n    satisfies §157(c)(1), the bankruptcy court should simply treat the\n    Stern claim as non-core. This conclusion accords with the Court’s\n    general approach to severability, which is to give effect to the valid\n    portion of a statute so long as it “remains ‘fully operative as a law,’ ”\n    Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.,\n    561 U. S. 477, 509, and so long as the statutory text and context do\n    not suggest that Congress would have preferred no statute at all,\n    ibid. Pp. 8–10.\n       3. Section 157(c)(1)’s procedures apply to the fraudulent\n    conveyance claims here. This Court assumes without deciding that\n    these claims are Stern claims, which Article III does not permit to be\n    treated as “core” claims under §157(b). But because the claims assert\n    that property of the bankruptcy estate was improperly removed, they\n    are self-evidently “related to a case under title 11.” Accordingly, they\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Pp. 11–\n  12.\n     4. Here, the District Court’s de novo review of the Bankruptcy\n  Court’s order and entry of its own valid final judgment cured any\n  potential error in the Bankruptcy Court’s entry of judgment. EBIA\n  contends that it was constitutionally entitled to review by an Article\n  III court regardless of whether the parties consented to bankruptcy\n  court adjudication. In the alternative, EBIA asserts that even if such\n  consent were constitutionally permissible, it did not in fact consent.\n  Neither contention need be addressed here, because EBIA received\n  the same review from the District Court that it would have received\n  had the Bankruptcy Court treated the claims as non-core proceedings\n  under §157(c)(1).

Marshall, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), this Court\nheld that even though bankruptcy courts are statutorily\nauthorized to enter final judgment on a class of bankruptcy-\nrelated claims, Article III of the Constitution prohibits\nbankruptcy courts from finally adjudicating certain of\nthose claims. Stern did not, however, decide how bank-\nruptcy or district courts should proceed when a “Stern\nclaim” is identified. We hold today that when, under\nStern’s reasoning, the Constitution does not permit a\nbankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a bankruptcy-\nrelated claim, the relevant statute nevertheless permits a\nbankruptcy court to issue proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law to be reviewed de novo by the district\ncourt. Because the District Court in this case conducted\nthe de novo review that petitioner demands, we affirm the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals upholding the District\nCourt’s decision.\n2       EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n   Nicolas Paleveda and his wife owned and operated two\ncompanies—Aegis Retirement Income Services, Inc.\n(ARIS), and Bellingham Insurance Agency, Inc. (BIA). By\nearly 2006, BIA had become insolvent, and on January 31,\n2006, the company ceased operation. The next day,\nPaleveda used BIA funds to incorporate Executive Bene-\nfits Insurance Agency, Inc. (EBIA), petitioner in this case.\nPaleveda and others initiated a scheme to transfer assets\nfrom BIA to EBIA. The assets were deposited into an\naccount held jointly by ARIS and EBIA and ultimately\ncredited to EBIA at the end of the year.\n   On June 1, 2006, BIA filed a voluntary Chapter 7 bank-\nruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for\nthe Western District of Washington. Peter Arkison, the\nbankruptcy trustee and respondent in this case, filed a\ncomplaint in the same Bankruptcy Court against EBIA\nand others. As relevant here, the complaint alleged that\nPaleveda used various methods to fraudulently convey\nBIA assets to EBIA.1 EBIA filed an answer and denied\nmany of the trustee’s allegations.\n   After some disagreement as to whether the trustee’s\nclaims should continue in the Bankruptcy Court or instead\nproceed before a jury in Federal District Court, the trustee\nfiled a motion for summary judgment against EBIA in the\nBankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court granted sum-\nmary judgment for the trustee on all claims, including the\nfraudulent conveyance claims. EBIA then appealed that\ndetermination to the District Court.

See MacDonald v. Plymouth County\nTrust Co., 286 U. S. 263, 266 (1932); see also Brubaker,\nsupra, at 128.\n   In 1978, Congress enacted sweeping changes to the\nfederal bankruptcy laws. See 92 Stat. 2549. The Bank-\nruptcy Reform Act eliminated the historical distinction\nbetween “ ‘summary’ ” jurisdiction belonging to bankruptcy\ncourts and “ ‘plenary’ ” jurisdiction belonging to either a\ndistrict court or an appropriate state court. Northern\nPipeline, supra, at 54 (plurality opinion); see also 1 W.\nNorton & W. Norton Bankruptcy Law and Practice §4:12,\np. 4–44 (3d ed. 2013). Instead, the 1978 Act mandated\nthat bankruptcy judges “shall exercise” jurisdiction over\n“all civil proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or\nrelated to cases under title 11.” 28 U. S. C. §§1471(b)–(c)\n(1976 ed., Supp. IV). Under the 1978 Act, bankruptcy\njudges were “vested with all of the ‘powers of a court of\nequity, law, and admiralty,’ ” with only a few limited ex-\nceptions. Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 55 (plurality\nopinion) (quoting §1481). Notwithstanding their expanded\njurisdiction and authority, these bankruptcy judges were\nnot afforded the protections of Article III—namely, life\ntenure and a salary that may not be diminished. Id.,\nat 53.\n   In Northern Pipeline, this Court addressed whether\nbankruptcy judges under the 1978 Act could “constitution-\nally be vested with jurisdiction to decide [a] state-law\ncontract claim” against an entity not otherwise a party to\nthe proceeding. Id., at 53, 87, n. 40. The Court concluded\n6       EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthat assignment of that claim for resolution by the bank-\nruptcy judge “violates Art. III of the Constitution.” Id., at\n52, 87 (plurality opinion); see id., at 91 (Rehnquist, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). The Court distinguished be-\ntween cases involving so-called “public rights,” which may\nbe removed from the jurisdiction of Article III courts, and\ncases involving “private rights,” which may not. See id., at\n69–71 (plurality opinion); id., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concur-\nring in judgment). Specifically, the plurality noted that\n“the restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is at\nthe core of the federal bankruptcy power, must be distin-\nguished from the adjudication of state-created private\nrights,” which belong in an Article III court. Id., at 71–72,\nand n. 26.\n                              B\n   Against that historical backdrop, Congress enacted the\nBankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of\n1984—the Act at issue in this case. See 28 U. S. C. §151\net seq. Under the 1984 Act, federal district courts have\n“original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title\n11,” §1334(a), and may refer to bankruptcy judges any\n“proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related\nto a case under title 11,” §157(a).6 Bankruptcy judges\nserve 14-year terms subject to removal for cause,\n§§152(a)(1), (e), and their salaries are set by Congress,\n§153(a).\n   The 1984 Act largely restored the bifurcated jurisdic-\ntional scheme that existed prior to the 1978 Act. The 1984\nAct implements that bifurcated scheme by dividing all\nmatters that may be referred to the bankruptcy court\ninto two categories: “core” and “non-core” proceedings. See\ngenerally §157.7 It is the bankruptcy court’s responsibility\n——————\n  6 In addition, district courts may also withdraw such matters from the\n\nbankruptcy courts for “cause shown.” §157(d).\n  7 In using the term “core,” Congress tracked the Northern Pipeline\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

Proc. 7012. For core\nproceedings, the statute contains a nonexhaustive list of\nexamples, including—as relevant here—“proceedings to\ndetermine, avoid, or recover fraudulent conveyances.”\n§157(b)(2)(H). The statute authorizes bankruptcy judges\nto “hear and determine” such claims and “enter appropri-\nate orders and judgments” on them. §157(b)(1). A final\njudgment entered in a core proceeding is appealable to the\ndistrict court, §158(a)(1), which reviews the judgment\nunder traditional appellate standards, Rule 8013.\n   As for “non-core” proceedings—i.e., proceedings that are\n“not . . . core” but are “otherwise related to a case under\ntitle 11”—the statute authorizes a bankruptcy court to\n“hear [the] proceeding,” and then “submit proposed find-\nings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.”\n§157(c)(1). The district court must then review those\nproposed findings and conclusions de novo and enter any\nfinal orders or judgments. Ibid. There is one statutory\nexception to this rule: If all parties “consent,” the statute\npermits the bankruptcy judge “to hear and determine and\nto enter appropriate orders and judgments” as if the pro-\nceeding were core. §157(c)(2).\n   Put simply: If a matter is core, the statute empowers the\nbankruptcy judge to enter final judgment on the claim,\nsubject to appellate review by the district court. If a mat-\nter is non-core, and the parties have not consented to final\nadjudication by the bankruptcy court, the bankruptcy\njudge must propose findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nThen, the district court must review the proceeding\nde novo and enter final judgment.\n——————\nplurality’s use of the same term as a description of those claims that fell\nwithin the scope of the historical bankruptcy court’s power.

AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               C\n\n  Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, confronted an underly-\ning conflict between the 1984 Act and the requirements of\nArticle III. In particular, Stern considered a constitutional\nchallenge to the statutory designation of a particular claim\nas “core.” The bankrupt in that case had filed a common-\nlaw counterclaim for tortious interference against a credi-\ntor to the estate. Id., at ___. Section 157(b)(2)(C), as\nadded by the 1984 Act, lists “counterclaims by the estate\nagainst persons filing claims against the estate” as a core\nproceeding, thereby authorizing the bankruptcy court to\nadjudicate the claim to final judgment. See supra this\npage. The respondent in Stern objected that Congress had\nviolated Article III by vesting the power to adjudicate the\ntortious interference counterclaim in bankruptcy court.\nStern, 564 U. S., at ___.\n  We agreed. Id., at ___. In that circumstance, we held,\nCongress had improperly vested the Bankruptcy Court\nwith the “ ‘ judicial Power of the United States,’ ” just as in\nNorthern Pipeline. 564 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 21,\n38). Because “[n]o ‘public right’ exception excuse[d] the\nfailure to comply with Article III,” we concluded that\nCongress could not confer on the Bankruptcy Court the\nauthority to finally decide the claim. Id., at ___. (slip op.,\nat 21).\n                            III\n  Stern made clear that some claims labeled by Congress\nas “core” may not be adjudicated by a bankruptcy court in\nthe manner designated by §157(b). Stern did not, how-\never, address how the bankruptcy court should proceed\nunder those circumstances. We turn to that question now.\n  The Ninth Circuit held that the fraudulent conveyance\nclaims at issue here are Stern claims—that is, proceedings\nthat are defined as “core” under §157(b) but may not, as a\nconstitutional matter, be adjudicated as such (at least in\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe absence of consent, see n. 4, supra. See 702 F. 3d, at\n562. Neither party contests that conclusion.\n  The lower courts, including the Ninth Circuit in this\ncase, have described Stern claims as creating a statutory\n“gap.” See, e.g., 702 F. 3d, at 565. By definition, a Stern\nclaim may not be adjudicated to final judgment by the\nbankruptcy court, as in a typical core proceeding. But the\nalternative procedure, whereby the bankruptcy court\nsubmits proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,\napplies only to non-core claims. See §157(c)(1). Because\n§157(b) does not explicitly authorize bankruptcy judges to\nsubmit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in\na core proceeding, the argument goes, Stern created a\n“gap” in the bankruptcy statute. See 702 F. 3d, at 565.\nThat gap purportedly renders the bankruptcy court power-\nless to act on Stern claims, see Brief for Petitioner 46–48,\nthus requiring the district court to hear all Stern claims in\nthe first instance.\n  We disagree. The statute permits Stern claims to pro-\nceed as non-core within the meaning of §157(c). In partic-\nular, the statute contains a severability provision that\naccounts for decisions, like Stern, that invalidate certain\napplications of the statute:\n    “If any provision of this Act or the application thereof\n    to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the re-\n    mainder of this Act, or the application of that provi-\n    sion to persons or circumstances other than those as\n    to which it is held invalid, is not affected thereby.” 98\n    Stat. 344, note following 28 U. S. C. §151.\n  The plain text of this severability provision closes the\nso-called “gap” created by Stern claims. When a court\nidentifies a claim as a Stern claim, it has necessarily “held\ninvalid” the “application” of §157(b)—i.e., the “core” label\nand its attendant procedures—to the litigant’s claim.\nNote following §151. In that circumstance, the statute\n10       EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninstructs that “the remainder of th[e] Act . . . is not affected\nthereby.” Ibid. That remainder includes §157(c), which\ngoverns non-core proceedings. With the “core” category no\nlonger available for the Stern claim at issue, we look to\n§157(c)(1) to determine whether the claim may be adjudi-\ncated as a non-core claim—specifically, whether it is “not a\ncore proceeding” but is “otherwise related to a case under\ntitle 11.” If the claim satisfies the criteria of §157(c)(1),\nthe bankruptcy court simply treats the claims as non-core:\nThe bankruptcy court should hear the proceeding and\nsubmit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law\nto the district court for de novo review and entry of\njudgment.\n   The conclusion that the remainder of the statute may\ncontinue to apply to Stern claims accords with our general\napproach to severability. We ordinarily give effect to the\nvalid portion of a partially unconstitutional statute so long\nas it “remains ‘ “fully operative as a law,” ’ ” Free Enterprise\nFund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561\nU. S. 477, 509 (2010) (quoting New York v. United States,\n505 U. S. 144, 186 (1992)), and so long as it is not “ ‘evi-\ndent’ ” from the statutory text and context that Congress\nwould have preferred no statute at all, 561 U. S., at 509\n(quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684\n(1987)). Neither of those concerns applies here. Thus,\n§157(c) may be applied naturally to Stern claims. And,\nEBIA has identified “nothing in the statute’s text or his-\ntorical context” that makes it “evident” that Congress\nwould prefer to suspend Stern claims in limbo. 561 U. S.,\nat 509.8\n——————\n  8 To the contrary, we noted in Stern that removal of claims from core\n\nbankruptcy jurisdiction does not “meaningfully chang[e] the division of\nlabor in the current statute.” 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 37). Accept-\ning EBIA’s contention that district courts are required to hear all Stern\nclaims in the first instance, see Brief for Petitioner 46–48, would\ndramatically alter the division of responsibility set by Congress.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   Now we must determine whether the procedures set\nforth in §157(c)(1) apply to the fraudulent conveyance\nclaims at issue in this case. The Court of Appeals held,\nand we assume without deciding, that the fraudulent\nconveyance claims in this case are Stern claims. See Part\nIII, supra. For purposes of this opinion, the “application”\nof both the “core” label and the procedures of §157(b) to\nthe trustee’s claims has therefore been “held invalid.”\nNote following §151. Accordingly, we must decide whether\nthe fraudulent conveyance claims brought by the trustee\nare within the scope of §157(c)(1)—that is, “not . . . core”\nproceedings but “otherwise related to a case under title\n11.” We hold that this language encompasses the trustee’s\nclaims of fraudulent conveyance.\n   First, the fraudulent conveyance claims in this case are\n“not . . . core.” The Ninth Circuit held—and no party\ndisputes—that Article III does not permit these claims to\nbe treated as “core.” See Part III, supra. Second, the\nfraudulent conveyance claims are self-evidently “related to\na case under title 11.” At bottom, a fraudulent conveyance\nclaim asserts that property that should have been part of\nthe bankruptcy estate and therefore available for distribu-\ntion to creditors pursuant to Title 11 was improperly\nremoved. That sort of claim is “related to a case under\ntitle 11” under any plausible construction of the statutory\ntext, and no party contends otherwise. See, e.g., Celotex\nCorp. v. Edwards, 514 U. S. 300, 307, n. 5, 308 (1995)\n(“Proceedings ‘related to’ the bankruptcy include . . . suits\nbetween third parties which have an effect on the bank-\nruptcy estate”). Accordingly, because these Stern claims\nfit comfortably within the category of claims governed by\n§157(c)(1), the Bankruptcy Court would have been permit-\nted to follow the procedures required by that provision,\ni.e., to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of\n12     EXECUTIVE BENEFITS INS. AGENCY v. ARKISON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw to the District Court to be reviewed de novo.\n                               B\n   Although this case did not proceed in precisely that\nfashion, we affirm nonetheless. A brief procedural history\nof the case helps explain why.\n   As noted, §157 permits a bankruptcy court to adjudicate\na claim to final judgment in two circumstances—in core\nproceedings, see §157(b), and in non-core proceedings\n“with the consent of all the parties,” §157(c)(2). In this\ncase, the Bankruptcy Court entered judgment in favor of\nthe bankruptcy trustee without specifying in its order\nwhether it was acting pursuant to §157(b) (core) or\n§157(c)(2) (non-core with consent). EBIA immediately\nappealed to the District Court, see §158, but it did not\nargue that the Bankruptcy Court lacked constitutional\nauthority to grant summary judgment. As a result, the\nDistrict Court did not analyze whether there was a Stern\nproblem and did not, as some district courts have done,\nrelabel the bankruptcy order as mere proposed findings of\nfact and conclusions of law. See, e.g., In re Parco Merged\nMedia Corp., 489 B. R. 323, 326 (Me. 2013) (collecting\ncases). The District Court did, however, review de novo\nthe Bankruptcy Court’s grant of summary judgment for\nthe trustee—a legal question—and issued a reasoned\nopinion affirming the Bankruptcy Court. The District\nCourt then separately entered judgment in favor of the\ntrustee. See 28 U. S. C. §1334(b) (“[T]he district courts\nshall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil\nproceedings . . . related to cases under title 11”).\n   EBIA now objects on constitutional grounds to the\nBankruptcy Court’s disposition of the fraudulent convey-\nance claims. EBIA contends that it was constitutionally\nentitled to review of its fraudulent conveyance claims by\nan Article III court regardless of whether the parties\nconsented to adjudication by a bankruptcy court. Brief for\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner 25–27. In an alternative argument, EBIA\nasserts that even if the Constitution permitted the Bank-\nruptcy Court to adjudicate its claim with the consent of\nthe parties, it did not in fact consent. Id., at 38.\n   In light of the procedural posture of this case, however,\nwe need not decide whether EBIA’s contentions are correct\non either score. At bottom, EBIA argues that it was enti-\ntled to have an Article III court review de novo and enter\njudgment on the fraudulent conveyance claims asserted by\nthe trustee. In effect, EBIA received exactly that. The\nDistrict Court conducted de novo review of the summary\njudgment claims, concluding in a written opinion that\nthere were no disputed issues of material fact and that the\ntrustee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In\naccordance with its statutory authority over matters\nrelated to the bankruptcy, see §1334(b), the District Court\nthen separately entered judgment in favor of the trustee.\nEBIA thus received the same review from the District\nCourt that it would have received if the Bankruptcy Court\nhad treated the fraudulent conveyance claims as non-core\nproceedings under §157(c)(1). In short, even if EBIA is\ncorrect that the Bankruptcy Court’s entry of judgment was\ninvalid, the District Court’s de novo review and entry of its\nown valid final judgment cured any error. Cf. Carter v.\nKubler, 320 U. S. 243, 248 (1943) (bankruptcy commis-\nsioner’s error was cured after the District Court “made\nan independent and complete review of the conflicting\nevidence”).\n   Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2677565/", "sha1": "66a93b65921bc4876495bf06cf7e134bdffdb70e", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-055", "time_retrieved": "2014-06-09T08:01:44.257758"}
