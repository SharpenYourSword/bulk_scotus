Argued April 23, 2014—Decided June 9, 2014\nFederal law pre-empts state-law statutes of limitations in certain tort\n  actions involving personal injury or property damage arising from the\n  release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant into the\n  environment. 42 U. S. C. §9658. Petitioner CTS Corporation sold\n  property on which it had stored chemicals as part its operations as an\n  electronics plant. Twenty-four years later, respondents, the owners\n  of portions of that property and adjacent landowners, sued, alleging\n  damages from the stored contaminants. CTS moved to dismiss, cit-\n  ing a state statute of repose that prevented subjecting a defendant to\n  a tort suit brought more than 10 years after the defendant’s last cul-\n  pable act. Because CTS’s last act occurred when it sold the property,\n  the District Court granted the motion. Finding §9658 ambiguous, the\n  Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the statute’s remedial purpose\n  favored pre-emption.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed.\n723 F. 3d 434, reversed.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  all but Part II–D, concluding that §9658 does not pre-empt state\n  statutes of repose. Pp. 5–16.\n     (a) The outcome here turns on whether §9658 distinguishes be-\n  tween statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, which are both\n  used to limit the temporal extent or duration of tort liability. There\n  is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two,\n  but their specified time periods are measured differently and they\n  seek to attain different purposes and objectives. Statutes of limita-\n  tions are designed to promote justice by encouraging plaintiffs to pur-\n  sue claims diligently and begin to run when a claim accrues. Stat-\n2                      CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    utes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should\n    be free from liability after a legislatively determined amount of time\n    and are measured from the date of the defendant’s last culpable act\n    or omission. The application of equitable tolling underscores their\n    difference in purpose. Because a statute of limitations’ purpose is not\n    furthered by barring an untimely action brought by a plaintiff who\n    was prevented by extraordinary circumstances from timely filing, eq-\n    uitable tolling operates to pause the running of the statute. The pur-\n    pose of statutes of repose are unaffected by such circumstances, and\n    equitable tolling does not apply. Pp. 5–8.\n       (b) The text and structure of §9658 resolve this case. Under that\n    provision, pre-emption is characterized as an “[e]xception,”\n    §9658(a)(1), to the regular rule that the “the statute of limitations es-\n    tablished under State law” applies. The “applicable limitations peri-\n    od,” the “commencement date” of which is subject to pre-emption, is\n    defined as “the period specified in a statute of limitations.”\n    §9658(b)(2). That term appears four times, and “statute of repose”\n    does not appear at all. While it is apparent from the historical devel-\n    opment of the two terms that their general usage has not always\n    been precise, their distinction was well enough established to be re-\n    flected in the 1982 Study Group Report that guided §9658’s enact-\n    ment, acknowledged the distinction, and urged the repeal of both\n    types of statutes. Because that distinction is not similarly reflected\n    in §9658, it is proper to conclude that Congress did not intend to pre-\n    empt statutes of repose.\n       Other textual features further support this conclusion. It would be\n    awkward to use the singular “applicable limitations period” to man-\n    date pre-emption of two different time periods with two different\n    purposes. And the definition of that limitations period as “the peri-\n    od” during which a “civil action” under state law “may be brought,”\n    §9658(b)(2), presupposes that a civil action exists. A statute of re-\n    pose, in contrast, can prohibit a cause of action from ever coming into\n    existence. Section 9658’s inclusion of a tolling rule also suggests that\n    the statute’s reach is limited to statutes of limitations, which tradi-\n    tionally have been subject to tolling. Respondents contend that\n    §9658 also effects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose\n    create an obstacle to Congress’ purposes and objectives, see Wyeth v.\n    Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 563–564. But the level of generality at which\n    the statute’s purpose is framed affects whether a specific reading will\n    further or hinder that purpose. Here, where Congress chose to leave\n    many areas of state law untouched, respondents have not shown that\n    statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obstacle to the attainment of\n    statutory purposes.

S. C. §9601 et seq., contains a provision\nthat by its terms pre-empts statutes of limitations appli­\ncable to state-law tort actions in certain circumstances.\n§9658. Section 9658 applies to statutes of limitations\ngoverning actions for personal injury or property damage\narising from the release of a hazardous substance, pollu­\ntant, or contaminant into the environment.\n  Section 9658 adopts what is known as the discovery\nrule. Under this framework, statutes of limitations in\ncovered actions begin to run when a plaintiff discovers, or\nreasonably should have discovered, that the harm in\nquestion was caused by the contaminant. A person who is\nexposed to a toxic contaminant may not develop or show\nsigns of resulting injury for many years, and so Congress\nenacted §9658 out of concern for long latency periods.\n  It is undoubted that the discovery rule in §9658 pre­\nempts state statutes of limitations that are in conflict with\n2               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits terms. The question presented in this case is whether\n§9658 also pre-empts state statutes of repose.\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit held that §9658 does pre-empt statutes of repose.\nThat holding was in error, and, for the reasons that follow,\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.\n                             I\n  Congress enacted CERCLA in 1980 “to promote ‘ “the\ntimely cleanup of hazardous waste sites” ’ and to ensure\nthat the costs of such cleanup efforts were borne by those\nresponsible for the contamination.” Burlington N. & S. F.\nR. Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. 599, 602 (2009) (quoting\nConsolidated Edison Co. of New York v. UGI Utilities, Inc.,\n423 F. 3d 90, 94 (CA2 2005)). The Act provided a federal\ncause of action to recover costs of cleanup from culpable\nentities but not a federal cause of action for personal\ninjury or property damage. Instead, CERCLA directed\npreparation of an expert report to determine “the ade-\nquacy of existing common law and statutory remedies in\nproviding legal redress for harm to man and the environ­\nment caused by the release of hazardous substances into\nthe environment,” including “barriers to recovery posed by\nexisting statutes of limitations.” 42 U. S. C. §9651(e)(1),\n(3)(F).\n  The 1982 report resulting from that statutory directive\nproposed certain changes to state tort law. Senate Com­\nmittee on Environment and Public Works, Superfund\nSection 301(e) Study Group, Injuries and Damages from\nHazardous Wastes—Analysis and Improvement of Legal\nRemedies, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. (Comm. Print 1982) (here­\ninafter Study Group Report or Report). As relevant here,\nthe Study Group Report noted the long latency periods\ninvolved in harm caused by toxic substances and “recom­\nmend[ed] that all states that have not already done so,\nclearly adopt the rule that an action accrues when the\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury or\ndisease and its cause.” Id., at pt. 1, 256. The Report\nfurther stated: “The Recommendation is intended also to\ncover the repeal of the statutes of repose which, in a num­\nber of states[,] have the same effect as some statutes of\nlimitation in barring [a] plaintiff ’s claim before he knows\nthat he has one.” Ibid.\n   Congress did not wait long for States to respond to some\nor all of the Report’s recommendations. Instead, Congress\ndecided to act at the federal level. Congress amended\nCERCLA in 1986 to add the provision now codified in\n§9658. Whether §9658 repeals statutes of repose, as the\nStudy Group Report recommended, is the question to be\naddressed here.\n   The instant case arose in North Carolina, where CTS\nCorporation ran an electronics plant in Asheville from\n1959 to 1985. (A subsidiary, CTS of Asheville, Inc., ran\nthe plant until 1983, when CTS Corporation took over.)\nThe plant manufactured and disposed of electronics and\nelectronic parts. In the process, it stored the chemicals\ntrichloroethylene (TCE) and cis-1, 2-dichloroethane (DCE).\nIn 1987, CTS sold the property, along with a promise that\nthe site was environmentally sound. The buyer eventually\nsold portions of the property to individuals who, along\nwith adjacent landowners, brought this suit alleging dam­\nage from contaminants on the land. Those who alleged\nthe injury and damage were the plaintiffs in the trial court\nand are respondents here.\n   Their suit was brought in 2011, 24 years after CTS sold\nthe property. The suit, filed in the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of North Carolina, was a\nstate-law nuisance action against CTS, petitioner here.\nRespondents sought “reclamation” of “toxic chemical con­\ntaminants” belonging to petitioner, “remediation of the\nenvironmental harm caused” by contaminants, and “mone­\ntary damages in an amount that will fully compensate\n4                CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthem for all the losses and damages they have suffered,\n. . . and will suffer in the future.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n57a. Respondents claim that in 2009 they learned from\nthe Environmental Protection Agency that their well\nwater was contaminated, allegedly while petitioner oper­\nated its electronics plant.\n    Citing North Carolina’s statute of repose, CTS moved to\ndismiss the claim. That statute prevents subjecting a\ndefendant to a tort suit brought more than 10 years after\nthe last culpable act of the defendant. N. C. Gen. Stat.\nAnn. §1–52(16) (Lexis 2013) (“[N]o cause of action shall\naccrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of\nthe defendant giving rise to the cause of action”); Robinson\nv. Wadford, ___ N. C. App. ___, ___, 731 S. E. 2d 539, 541\n(2012) (referring to the provision as a “statute of repose”).\nBecause CTS’ last act occurred in 1987, when it sold the\nelectronics plant, the District Court accepted the recom­\nmendation of a Magistrate Judge and granted CTS’ motion\nto dismiss.\n    A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit reversed, ruling that §9658 pre-empted the statute\nof repose. 723 F. 3d 434 (2013). The majority found §9658\n“ambiguous,” but also found that the interpretation in\nfavor of pre-emption was preferable because of CERCLA’s\nremedial purpose. Id., at 443–444.\n    Judge Thacker dissented. Id., at 445–454. She found\nthe statutory text’s exclusion of statutes of repose to be\n“plain and unambiguous.” Id., at 445. She further indi­\ncated that, even “if the preemptive effect of §9658 were\nsusceptible to two interpretations, a presumption against\npreemption would counsel that we should limit §9658’s\npreemptive reach to statutes of limitations without also\nextending it to statutes of repose.” Ibid.\n    The Courts of Appeals, as well as the Supreme Court of\nSouth Dakota, have rendered conflicting judgments on\nthis question.

Statutes of limitations and stat­\nutes of repose both are mechanisms used to limit the\ntemporal extent or duration of liability for tortious acts.\nBoth types of statute can operate to bar a plaintiff ’s suit,\nand in each instance time is the controlling factor. There\nis considerable common ground in the policies underlying\nthe two types of statute. But the time periods specified\nare measured from different points, and the statutes seek\nto attain different purposes and objectives. And, as will be\nexplained, §9658 mandates a distinction between the two.\n   In the ordinary course, a statute of limitations creates “a\ntime limit for suing in a civil case, based on the date when\nthe claim accrued.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1546 (9th ed.\n2009) (Black’s); see also Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life &\nAccident Ins. Co., 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4)\n(“As a general matter, a statute of limitations begins to\nrun when the cause of action ‘ “accrues” ’—that is, when\n‘the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief ’ ” (quoting Bay\nArea Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v.\nFerbar Corp. of Cal., Inc., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997))).\nMeasured by this standard, a claim accrues in a personal­\ninjury or property-damage action “when the injury oc­\ncurred or was discovered.” Black’s 1546. For example,\nNorth Carolina, whose laws are central to this case, has a\nstatute of limitations that allows a person three years to\nbring suit for personal injury or property damage, begin­\n6                CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nning on the date that damage “becomes apparent or ought\nreasonably to have become apparent to the claimant,\nwhichever event first occurs.” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §1–\n52(16).\n   A statute of repose, on the other hand, puts an outer\nlimit on the right to bring a civil action. That limit is\nmeasured not from the date on which the claim accrues\nbut instead from the date of the last culpable act or omis­\nsion of the defendant. A statute of repose “bar[s] any suit\nthat is brought after a specified time since the defendant\nacted (such as by designing or manufacturing a product),\neven if this period ends before the plaintiff has suffered a\nresulting injury.” Black’s 1546. The statute of repose\nlimit is “not related to the accrual of any cause of action;\nthe injury need not have occurred, much less have been\ndiscovered.” 54 C. J. S., Limitations of Actions §7, p. 24\n(2010) (hereinafter C. J. S.). The repose provision is there­\nfore equivalent to “a cutoff,” Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,\nPrupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, 363 (1991),\nin essence an “absolute . . . bar” on a defendant’s temporal\nliability, C. J. S. §7, at 24.\n   Although there is substantial overlap between the poli­\ncies of the two types of statute, each has a distinct purpose\nand each is targeted at a different actor. Statutes of limi­\ntations require plaintiffs to pursue “diligent prosecution of\nknown claims.” Black’s 1546. Statutes of limitations\n“promote justice by preventing surprises through [plain­\ntiffs’] revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber\nuntil evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and\nwitnesses have disappeared.” Railroad Telegraphers v.\nRailway Express Agency, Inc., 321 U. S. 342, 348–349\n(1944). Statutes of repose also encourage plaintiffs to\nbring actions in a timely manner, and for many of the\nsame reasons. But the rationale has a different emphasis.\nStatutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a\ndefendant should “be free from liability after the legisla­\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Like a\ndischarge in bankruptcy, a statute of repose can be said to\nprovide a fresh start or freedom from liability. Indeed, the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause has been described as “a statute\nof repose” because it in part embodies the idea that at\nsome point a defendant should be able to put past events\nbehind him. Jones v. Thomas, 491 U. S. 376, 392 (1989)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   One central distinction between statutes of limitations\nand statutes of repose underscores their differing purposes.\nStatutes of limitations, but not statutes of repose, are\nsubject to equitable tolling, a doctrine that “pauses the\nrunning of, or ‘tolls,’ a statute of limitations when a liti­\ngant has pursued his rights diligently but some extraordi­\nnary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely\naction.” Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U. S. 1, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 7). Statutes of repose, on the other\nhand, generally may not be tolled, even in cases of ex­\ntraordinary circumstances beyond a plaintiff ’s control.\nSee, e.g., Lampf, supra, at 363 (“[A] period of repose [is]\ninconsistent with tolling”); 4 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal\nPractice and Procedure §1056, p. 240 (3d ed. 2002) (“[A]\ncritical distinction is that a repose period is fixed and its\nexpiration will not be delayed by estoppel or tolling”);\nRestatement (Second) of Torts §899, Comment g (1977).\n   Equitable tolling is applicable to statutes of limitations\nbecause their main thrust is to encourage the plaintiff to\n“pursu[e] his rights diligently,” and when an “extraordi­\nnary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely\naction,” the restriction imposed by the statute of limita­\n8                  CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ntions does not further the statute’s purpose. Lozano,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 7). But a statute of repose is a\njudgment that defendants should “be free from liability\nafter the legislatively determined period of time, beyond\nwhich the liability will no longer exist and will not be\ntolled for any reason.” C. J. S. §7, at 24. As an illustrative\nexample, under North Carolina law statutes of limitations\nmay be tolled but statutes of repose may not. See, e.g.,\nMonson v. Paramount Homes, Inc., 133 N. C.

Though the suit was filed in 2011, more\n10               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthan 20 years after petitioner sold the property at issue,\nrespondents allege that they learned about the contamina­\ntion only in 2009.\n                              C\n   The Court now examines in more detail the question\nwhether the state statute of repose is pre-empted by the\nfederal statute.\n   The Court of Appeals supported its interpretation of\n§9658 by invoking the proposition that remedial statutes\nshould be interpreted in a liberal manner. The Court of\nAppeals was in error when it treated this as a substitute\nfor a conclusion grounded in the statute’s text and struc­\nture. After all, almost every statute might be described as\nremedial in the sense that all statutes are designed to\nremedy some problem. And even if the Court identified\nsome subset of statutes as especially remedial, the Court\nhas emphasized that “no legislation pursues its purposes\nat all costs.” Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522,\n525–526 (1987) (per curiam). Congressional intent is\ndiscerned primarily from the statutory text. In any event,\nwere the Court to adopt a presumption to help resolve\nambiguity, substantial support also exists for the proposi­\ntion that “the States’ coordinate role in government coun­\nsels against reading” federal laws such as §9658 “to re­\nstrict the States’ sovereign capacity to regulate” in areas of\ntraditional state concern. FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health\nSystem, Inc., 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 18).\n   Turning to the statutory text, the Court notes first that\n§9658, in the caption of subsection (a), characterizes pre­\nemption as an “[e]xception” to the regular rule.\n§9658(a)(1). Section 9658 contains another subsection,\nwith the heading “State law generally applicable,” that\nprovides the rule that “the statute of limitations estab­\nlished under State law shall apply.” §9658(a)(2). Under\nthis structure, state law is not pre-empted unless it fits\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninto the precise terms of the exception.\n   The statute defines the “applicable limitations period,”\nthe “commencement date” of which is subject to pre­\nemption, as a period specified in “a statute of limitations.”\n§9658(b)(2). Indeed, §9658 uses the term “statute of limi­\ntations” four times (not including the caption), but not the\nterm “statute of repose.” This is instructive, but it is not\ndispositive. While the term “statute of limitations” has\nacquired a precise meaning, distinct from “statute of\nrepose,” and while that is its primary meaning, it must be\nacknowledged that the term “statute of limitations” is\nsometimes used in a less formal way. In that sense, it can\nrefer to any provision restricting the time in which a\nplaintiff must bring suit. See Black’s 1546; see also Ernst\n& Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 210 (1976). Con­\ngress has used the term “statute of limitations” when\nenacting statutes of repose. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §78u–\n6(h)(1)(B)(iii)(I)(aa) (2012 ed.) (creating a statute of repose\nand placing it in a provision entitled “Statute of limita­\ntions”); 42 U. S. C. §2278 (same). And petitioner does not\npoint out an example in which Congress has used the term\n“statute of repose.” So the Court must proceed to examine\nother evidence of the meaning of the term “statute of\nlimitations” as it is used in §9658. The parties debate the\nhistorical development of the terms “statute of limitations”\nand “statute of repose” in an effort to show how these\nterms were likely understood in 1986, when Congress\nenacted §9658. It is apparent that the distinction between\nstatutes of limitations and statutes of repose was under­\nstood by some courts and scholars before 1986. The 1977\nRestatement of Torts noted that “[i]n recent years special\n‘statutes of repose’ have been adopted in some states . . . .\nThe statutory period in these acts is usually longer than\nthat for the regular statute of limitations, but . . . may\nhave run before a cause of action came fully into exist­\nence.” Restatement (Second) of Torts §899, Comment g.\n12               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   But that usage, now predominant, then was not the only\ndefinition of the two terms. One scholar, writing in 1981,\ndescribed multiple usages of the terms, including both a\nusage in which the terms are equivalent and also the\nmodern, more precise usage. McGovern, The Variety,\nPolicy and Constitutionality of Product Liability Statutes\nof Repose, 30 Am. U. L. Rev. 579, 584 (1981) (describing a\nstatute of repose as “distinct from a statute of limitation\nbecause [a statute of repose] begins to run at a time unre­\nlated to the traditional accrual of the cause of action”).\n   Respondents note that an entry in Black’s Law Diction­\nary from 1979 describes a statute of limitations as follows:\n“Statutes of limitations are statutes of repose.” Black’s\n835 (5th ed.). That statement likely reflects an earlier,\nbroader usage in which the term “statute of repose” re­\nferred to all provisions delineating the time in which a\nplaintiff must bring suit. See, e.g., Pillow v. Roberts, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 477 (1852) (“Statutes of limitation . . . are stat­\nutes of repose, and should not be evaded by a forced con­\nstruction”); Rosenberg v. North Bergen, 61 N. J. 190, 201,\n293 A. 2d 662, 667 (1972) (“All statutes limiting in any\nway the time within which a judicial remedy may be\nsought are statutes of repose”); Black’s 1077 (rev. 4th ed.\n1968) (defining “statute of limitations” as “[a] statute . . .\ndeclaring that no suit shall be maintained . . . unless\nbrought within a specified period after the right accrued.\nStatutes of limitation are statutes of repose”); Ballentine’s\nLaw Dictionary 1233 (2d ed. 1948) (similar). That usage\ndoes not necessarily support respondents’ interpretation,\nbecause the broad usage of the term “statute of repose”\ndoes not mean that the term “statute of limitations” must\nrefer to both types of statute.\n   From all this, it is apparent that general usage of the\nlegal terms has not always been precise, but the concept\nthat statutes of repose and statutes of limitations are\ndistinct was well enough established to be reflected in the\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1982 Study Group Report, commissioned by Congress. In\none of its recommendations, the Study Group Report\ncalled on States to adopt the discovery rule now embodied\nin §9658. Study Group Report, pt. 1, at 256. The Report\nacknowledged that statutes of repose were not equivalent\nto statutes of limitations and that a recommendation to\npre-empt the latter did not necessarily include the former.\nFor immediately it went on to state: “The Recommenda­\ntion is intended also to cover the repeal of the statutes of\nrepose which, in a number of states[,] have the same effect\nas some statutes of limitation in barring [a] plaintiff ’s\nclaim before he knows that he has one.” Ibid. The schol­\nars and professionals who were discussing this matter\n(and indeed were advising Congress) knew of a clear dis­\ntinction between the two.\n   The Report clearly urged the repeal of statutes of repose\nas well as statutes of limitations. But in so doing the\nReport did what the statute does not: It referred to stat­\nutes of repose as a distinct category. And when Congress\ndid not make the same distinction, it is proper to conclude\nthat Congress did not exercise the full scope of its pre­\nemption power.\n   While the use of the term “statute of limitations” in\n§9658 is not dispositive, the Court’s textual inquiry does\nnot end there, for other features of the statutory text\nfurther support the exclusion of statutes of repose. The\ntext of §9658 includes language describing the covered\nperiod in the singular. The statute uses the terms “the\napplicable limitations period,” “such period shall com­\nmence,” and “the statute of limitations established under\nState law.” This would be an awkward way to mandate\nthe pre-emption of two different time periods with two\ndifferent purposes.\n   True, the Dictionary Act states that “words importing\nthe singular include and apply to several persons, parties,\nor things” unless “the context indicates otherwise.” 1\n14               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. §1. But the Court has relied on this directive\nwhen the rule is “ ‘necessary to carry out the evident intent\nof the statute.’ ” United States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415,\n422, n. 5 (2009) (quoting First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v.\nMissouri, 263 U. S. 640, 657 (1924)). As discussed, the\ncontext here shows an evident intent not to cover statutes\nof repose.\n   Further, to return again to the definition of the “appli­\ncable limitations period,” the statute describes it as “the\nperiod” during which a “civil action” under state law “may\nbe brought.” §9658(b)(2). It is true that in a literal sense\na statute of repose limits the time during which a suit\n“may be brought” because it provides a point after which a\nsuit cannot be brought. Ibid.; see C. J. S. §7, at 24 (“A\nstatute of repose . . . limits the time within which an\naction may be brought”). But the definition of the “appli­\ncable limitations period” presupposes that “a [covered]\ncivil action” exists. §9658(b)(2). Black’s Law Dictionary\ndefines a “civil action” as identical to an “action at law,”\nwhich in relevant part is defined as a “civil suit stating a\nlegal cause of action.” Black’s 32–33, 279 (9th ed. 2009);\nsee also id., at 222 (5th ed. 1979).\n   A statute of repose, however, as noted above, “is not\nrelated to the accrual of any cause of action.” C. J. S. §7,\nat 24. Rather, it mandates that there shall be no cause of\naction beyond a certain point, even if no cause of action\nhas yet accrued. Thus, a statute of repose can prohibit a\ncause of action from coming into existence. See, e.g., N. C.\nGen. Stat. Ann. §1–52(16) (“[N]o cause of action shall\naccrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of\nthe defendant giving rise to the cause of action”); see also\nHargett v. Holland, 337 N. C. 651, 654–655, 447 S. E. 2d\n784, 787 (1994) (“A statute of repose creates an additional\nelement of the claim itself which must be satisfied in order\nfor the claim to be maintained . . . . If the action is not\nbrought within the specified period, the plaintiff literally\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhas no cause of action” (internal quotation marks omit­\nted)); Lamb v. Wedgewood South Corp., 308 N. C. 419,\n440–441, 302 S. E. 2d 868, 880 (1983). A statute of repose\ncan be said to define the scope of the cause of action, and\ntherefore the liability of the defendant. See Hargett,\nsupra, at 655–656, 447 S. E. 2d, at 788.\n   In light of the distinct purpose for statutes of repose, the\ndefinition of “applicable limitations period” (and thus also\nthe definition of “commencement date”) in §9658(b)(2) is\nbest read to encompass only statutes of limitations, which\ngenerally begin to run after a cause of action accrues and\nso always limit the time in which a civil action “may be\nbrought.” A statute of repose, however, may preclude an\nalleged tortfeasor’s liability before a plaintiff is entitled to\nsue, before an actionable harm ever occurs.\n   Another and altogether unambiguous textual indication\nthat §9658 does not pre-empt statutes of repose is that\n§9658 provides for equitable tolling for “minor or incompe­\ntent plaintiff[s].” §9658(b)(4)(B). As noted in the preced­\ning discussion, a “critical distinction” between statutes of\nlimitations and statutes of repose “is that a repose period\nis fixed and its expiration will not be delayed by estoppel\nor tolling.” 4 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§1056, at 240. As a consequence, the inclusion of a tolling\nrule in §9658 suggests that the statute’s reach is limited to\nstatutes of limitations, which traditionally have been\nsubject to tolling. It would be odd for Congress, if it did\nseek to pre-empt statutes of repose, to pre-empt not just\nthe commencement date of statutes of repose but also\nstate law prohibiting tolling of statutes of repose—all\nwithout an express indication that §9658 was intended to\nreach the latter.\n   In addition to their argument that §9658 expressly pre­\nempts statutes of repose, respondents contend that §9658\neffects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose\n“creat[e] an unacceptable ‘obstacle to the accomplishment\n16               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                    Opinion of Kthe Court\n                     Opinion of ENNEDY, J.\n\nand execution of the full purposes and objectives of Con­\ngress.’ ” Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 563–564 (2009)\n(quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)).\nRespondents argue that pre-emption of statutes of repose\nadvances §9658’s purpose, namely to help plaintiffs bring\ntort actions for harm caused by toxic contaminants.\n  But the level of generality at which the statute’s pur­\npose is framed affects the judgment whether a specific\nreading will further or hinder that purpose. CERCLA, it\nmust be remembered, does not provide a complete reme-\ndial framework. The statute does not provide a general\ncause of action for all harm caused by toxic contaminants.\nSection 9658 leaves untouched States’ judgments about\ncauses of action, the scope of liability, the duration of the\nperiod provided by statutes of limitations, burdens of\nproof, rules of evidence, and other important rules govern­\ning civil actions. “ ‘The case for federal pre-emption is\nparticularly weak where Congress has indicated its\nawareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal\ninterest, and has nonetheless decided to stand by both\nconcepts and to tolerate whatever tension there [is] be­\ntween them.’ ” Wyeth, supra, at 574–575 (quoting Bonito\nBoats v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 166–167\n(1989)). Respondents have not shown that in light of\nCongress’ decision to leave those many areas of state law\nuntouched, statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obsta­\ncle to the attainment of CERCLA’s purposes.\n                            D\n   Under a proper interpretation of §9658, statutes of\nrepose are not within Congress’ pre-emption mandate.\nAlthough the natural reading of §9658’s text is that stat­\nutes of repose are excluded, the Court finds additional\nsupport for its conclusion in well-established “presump­\ntions about the nature of pre-emption.” Medtronic, Inc. v.\nLohr, 518 U. S. 470, 484–485 (1996) (citing Gade v. Na-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 111\n(1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment)).\n   “[B]ecause the States are independent sovereigns in our\nfederal system,” the Court “ ‘assum[es] that the historic\npolice powers of the States were not to be superseded by\nthe Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest\npurpose of Congress.’ ” Medtronic, supra, at 485 (quoting\nRice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947)).\n   It follows that “when the text of a pre-emption clause is\nsusceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts\nordinarily ‘accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption.’ ”\nAltria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S. 70, 77 (2008) (quoting\nBates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 449 (2005)).\nThat approach is “consistent with both federalism con­\ncerns and the historic primacy of state regulation of mat­\nters of health and safety.” Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 485.\n   The effect of that presumption is to support, where\nplausible, “a narrow interpretation” of an express pre­\nemption provision, ibid., especially “when Congress has\nlegislated in a field traditionally occupied by the States,”\nAltria, supra, at 77. The presumption has greatest force\nwhen Congress legislates in an area traditionally governed\nby the States’ police powers. See Rice, supra, at 230. “In\nour federal system, there is no question that States pos­\nsess the ‘traditional authority to provide tort remedies to\ntheir citizens’ as they see fit.” Wos v. E. M.

No. 99–962, pp. 87–88, 261\n(1986) (hereinafter Conference Report) (problem centers\non when state limitations periods begin to run rather than\nthe number of years they run; Congress therefore estab-\nlished “a [f]ederally-required commencement date”).\nCaptioned “Exception to State statutes,” §9658(a)(1) in-\nstructs that when the applicable state limitations period\nspecifies “a commencement date . . . earlier than the fed-\nerally required commencement date,” the federal date\nshall apply “in lieu of the date specified in [state law].”\n   The Court in the case at hand identifies as the relevant\nprescriptive period North Carolina’s 10-year repose provi-\nsion. I agree. But as I see it, the later “federally required\ncommencement date,” §9658(a)(1), (b)(4), displaces the\nearlier date state law prescribes.\n   Section 9658(b)(3) defines “commencement date” as “the\ndate specified in a statute of limitations as the beginning\nof the applicable limitations period.” Under North Caro-\nlina law, that date is determined by the occurrence of\n“the last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to\nthe [claim].” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 1–52(16). The defini-\ntion key to this controversy, however, appears in\n§9658(b)(4)(A): “ ‘[F]ederally required commencement date’\nmeans the date the plaintiff knew (or reasonably should\nhave known) that [her] injury . . . [was] caused . . . by the\nhazardous substance . . . concerned.” Congress, in short,\ndirected, in §9658(a)(1), that the federally prescribed\ndiscovery rule, set out in §9658(b)(4), shall apply “in lieu\nof ” the earlier “commencement date” (the defendant’s\n“last act or omission”) specified in N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n§1–52(16).\n   Why does the Court fight this straightforward reading?\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nAt length, the Court’s opinion distinguishes statutes of\nlimitations from statutes of repose. See ante, at 5–16. Yet\nNorth Carolina itself made its repose period a component\nof the statute prescribing periods for “the commencement\nof actions.” §§1–46, 1–52(16). What is a repose period, in\nessence, other than a limitations period unattended by a\ndiscovery rule? See Senate Committee on Environment\nand Public Works, Superfund Section 301(e) Study Group,\nInjuries and Damages from Hazardous Wastes—Analysis\nand Improvement of Legal Remedies, 97th Cong., 2d Sess.,\n(pt. 1) 255–256 (Comm. Print 1982) (hereinafter Study\nGroup Report).\n   The legislative history of §9658, moreover, shows why\nthe distinction the Court draws between statutes of limita-\ntions and repose prescriptions cannot be what Congress\nordered. As the Court recognizes, ante, at 2–3, Congress\namended CERCLA to include §9658 in response to the\nreport of an expert Study Group commissioned when\nCERCLA was enacted. That report directed its proposals\nto the States rather than to Congress. It “recommend[ed]\nthat the several states enhance and develop common law\nand statutory remedies, and that they remove unreasona-\nble procedural and other barriers to recovery in court\naction for personal injuries resulting from exposure to\nhazardous waste.” Study Group Report 255. The report\nthen made specific proposals. Under the heading “Stat-\nutes of Limitations,” the Study Group proposed (1) “that\nall [S]tates . . . clearly adopt the rule that an action ac-\ncrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discov-\nered the injury or disease and its cause” and (2) that\nStates repeal “statutes of repose which, in a number of\n[S]tates have the same effect as some statutes of limita-\ntion in barring plaintiff ’s claim before he knows he has\none.” Id., at 255–256. Both measures are necessary, the\nreport explained, because “many of the hazardous wastes\nare carcinogens” with “latency period[s] for the appearance\n4                   CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nof injury or disease . . . likely to [run] for thirty years or\nmore.” Id., at 255.\n  Beyond question, a repose period, like the 10-year period\nat issue here, will prevent recovery for injuries with la-\ntency periods running for decades. Thus, altering statutes\nof limitations to include a discovery rule would be of little\nuse in States with repose prescriptions.\n  Rather than await action by the States, Congress decid-\ned to implement the Study Group’s proposal itself by\nadopting §9658. Ante, at 3. The Conference Report re-\nlates the Study Group Report’s observation that “certain\nState statutes deprive plaintiffs of their day in court”\nbecause “[i]n the case of a long-latency disease, such as\ncancer,” a limitations period that begins to run before the\nplaintiff has discovered her injury frequently will make\ntimely suit impossible. Conference Report 261. The Con-\nference Report then states that “[t]his section”—§9658—\n“addresses the problem identified in the [Study Group\nReport].” Ibid. As the Study Group Report makes clear,\n“the problem” it identified, to which the Conference Report\nadverted, cannot be solved when statutes of repose remain\noperative. The Court’s interpretation thus thwarts Con-\ngress’ clearly expressed intent to fix “the problem” the\nStudy Group described.\n  In lieu of uniform application of the “federally required\ncommencement date,” §9658(b)(4), the Court allows those\nresponsible for environmental contamination, if they are\nlocated in the still small number of States with repose\nperiods,* to escape liability for the devastating harm they\ncause, harm hidden from detection for more than 10 years.\nInstead of encouraging prompt identification and remedia-\n——————\n  * See Conn.

Argued April 23, 2014—Decided June 9, 2014\nFederal law pre-empts state-law statutes of limitations in certain tort\n  actions involving personal injury or property damage arising from the\n  release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant into the\n  environment. 42 U. S. C. §9658. Petitioner CTS Corporation sold\n  property on which it had stored chemicals as part its operations as an\n  electronics plant. Twenty-four years later, respondents, the owners\n  of portions of that property and adjacent landowners, sued, alleging\n  damages from the stored contaminants. CTS moved to dismiss, cit-\n  ing a state statute of repose that prevented subjecting a defendant to\n  a tort suit brought more than 10 years after the defendant’s last cul-\n  pable act. Because CTS’s last act occurred when it sold the property,\n  the District Court granted the motion. Finding §9658 ambiguous, the\n  Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the statute’s remedial purpose\n  favored pre-emption.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed.\n723 F. 3d 434, reversed.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  all but Part II–D, concluding that §9658 does not pre-empt state\n  statutes of repose. Pp. 5–16.\n     (a) The outcome here turns on whether §9658 distinguishes be-\n  tween statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, which are both\n  used to limit the temporal extent or duration of tort liability. There\n  is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two,\n  but their specified time periods are measured differently and they\n  seek to attain different purposes and objectives. Statutes of limita-\n  tions are designed to promote justice by encouraging plaintiffs to pur-\n  sue claims diligently and begin to run when a claim accrues. Stat-\n2                      CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    utes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should\n    be free from liability after a legislatively determined amount of time\n    and are measured from the date of the defendant’s last culpable act\n    or omission. The application of equitable tolling underscores their\n    difference in purpose. Because a statute of limitations’ purpose is not\n    furthered by barring an untimely action brought by a plaintiff who\n    was prevented by extraordinary circumstances from timely filing, eq-\n    uitable tolling operates to pause the running of the statute. The pur-\n    pose of statutes of repose are unaffected by such circumstances, and\n    equitable tolling does not apply. Pp. 5–8.\n       (b) The text and structure of §9658 resolve this case. Under that\n    provision, pre-emption is characterized as an “[e]xception,”\n    §9658(a)(1), to the regular rule that the “the statute of limitations es-\n    tablished under State law” applies. The “applicable limitations peri-\n    od,” the “commencement date” of which is subject to pre-emption, is\n    defined as “the period specified in a statute of limitations.”\n    §9658(b)(2). That term appears four times, and “statute of repose”\n    does not appear at all. While it is apparent from the historical devel-\n    opment of the two terms that their general usage has not always\n    been precise, their distinction was well enough established to be re-\n    flected in the 1982 Study Group Report that guided §9658’s enact-\n    ment, acknowledged the distinction, and urged the repeal of both\n    types of statutes. Because that distinction is not similarly reflected\n    in §9658, it is proper to conclude that Congress did not intend to pre-\n    empt statutes of repose.\n       Other textual features further support this conclusion. It would be\n    awkward to use the singular “applicable limitations period” to man-\n    date pre-emption of two different time periods with two different\n    purposes. And the definition of that limitations period as “the peri-\n    od” during which a “civil action” under state law “may be brought,”\n    §9658(b)(2), presupposes that a civil action exists. A statute of re-\n    pose, in contrast, can prohibit a cause of action from ever coming into\n    existence. Section 9658’s inclusion of a tolling rule also suggests that\n    the statute’s reach is limited to statutes of limitations, which tradi-\n    tionally have been subject to tolling. Respondents contend that\n    §9658 also effects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose\n    create an obstacle to Congress’ purposes and objectives, see Wyeth v.\n    Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 563–564. But the level of generality at which\n    the statute’s purpose is framed affects whether a specific reading will\n    further or hinder that purpose. Here, where Congress chose to leave\n    many areas of state law untouched, respondents have not shown that\n    statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obstacle to the attainment of\n    statutory purposes.

S. C. §9601 et seq., contains a provision\nthat by its terms pre-empts statutes of limitations appli­\ncable to state-law tort actions in certain circumstances.\n§9658. Section 9658 applies to statutes of limitations\ngoverning actions for personal injury or property damage\narising from the release of a hazardous substance, pollu­\ntant, or contaminant into the environment.\n  Section 9658 adopts what is known as the discovery\nrule. Under this framework, statutes of limitations in\ncovered actions begin to run when a plaintiff discovers, or\nreasonably should have discovered, that the harm in\nquestion was caused by the contaminant. A person who is\nexposed to a toxic contaminant may not develop or show\nsigns of resulting injury for many years, and so Congress\nenacted §9658 out of concern for long latency periods.\n  It is undoubted that the discovery rule in §9658 pre­\nempts state statutes of limitations that are in conflict with\n2               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits terms. The question presented in this case is whether\n§9658 also pre-empts state statutes of repose.\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit held that §9658 does pre-empt statutes of repose.\nThat holding was in error, and, for the reasons that follow,\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.\n                             I\n  Congress enacted CERCLA in 1980 “to promote ‘ “the\ntimely cleanup of hazardous waste sites” ’ and to ensure\nthat the costs of such cleanup efforts were borne by those\nresponsible for the contamination.” Burlington N. & S. F.\nR. Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. 599, 602 (2009) (quoting\nConsolidated Edison Co. of New York v. UGI Utilities, Inc.,\n423 F. 3d 90, 94 (CA2 2005)). The Act provided a federal\ncause of action to recover costs of cleanup from culpable\nentities but not a federal cause of action for personal\ninjury or property damage. Instead, CERCLA directed\npreparation of an expert report to determine “the ade-\nquacy of existing common law and statutory remedies in\nproviding legal redress for harm to man and the environ­\nment caused by the release of hazardous substances into\nthe environment,” including “barriers to recovery posed by\nexisting statutes of limitations.” 42 U. S. C. §9651(e)(1),\n(3)(F).\n  The 1982 report resulting from that statutory directive\nproposed certain changes to state tort law. Senate Com­\nmittee on Environment and Public Works, Superfund\nSection 301(e) Study Group, Injuries and Damages from\nHazardous Wastes—Analysis and Improvement of Legal\nRemedies, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. (Comm. Print 1982) (here­\ninafter Study Group Report or Report). As relevant here,\nthe Study Group Report noted the long latency periods\ninvolved in harm caused by toxic substances and “recom­\nmend[ed] that all states that have not already done so,\nclearly adopt the rule that an action accrues when the\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury or\ndisease and its cause.” Id., at pt. 1, 256. The Report\nfurther stated: “The Recommendation is intended also to\ncover the repeal of the statutes of repose which, in a num­\nber of states[,] have the same effect as some statutes of\nlimitation in barring [a] plaintiff ’s claim before he knows\nthat he has one.” Ibid.\n   Congress did not wait long for States to respond to some\nor all of the Report’s recommendations. Instead, Congress\ndecided to act at the federal level. Congress amended\nCERCLA in 1986 to add the provision now codified in\n§9658. Whether §9658 repeals statutes of repose, as the\nStudy Group Report recommended, is the question to be\naddressed here.\n   The instant case arose in North Carolina, where CTS\nCorporation ran an electronics plant in Asheville from\n1959 to 1985. (A subsidiary, CTS of Asheville, Inc., ran\nthe plant until 1983, when CTS Corporation took over.)\nThe plant manufactured and disposed of electronics and\nelectronic parts. In the process, it stored the chemicals\ntrichloroethylene (TCE) and cis-1, 2-dichloroethane (DCE).\nIn 1987, CTS sold the property, along with a promise that\nthe site was environmentally sound. The buyer eventually\nsold portions of the property to individuals who, along\nwith adjacent landowners, brought this suit alleging dam­\nage from contaminants on the land. Those who alleged\nthe injury and damage were the plaintiffs in the trial court\nand are respondents here.\n   Their suit was brought in 2011, 24 years after CTS sold\nthe property. The suit, filed in the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of North Carolina, was a\nstate-law nuisance action against CTS, petitioner here.\nRespondents sought “reclamation” of “toxic chemical con­\ntaminants” belonging to petitioner, “remediation of the\nenvironmental harm caused” by contaminants, and “mone­\ntary damages in an amount that will fully compensate\n4                CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthem for all the losses and damages they have suffered,\n. . . and will suffer in the future.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n57a. Respondents claim that in 2009 they learned from\nthe Environmental Protection Agency that their well\nwater was contaminated, allegedly while petitioner oper­\nated its electronics plant.\n    Citing North Carolina’s statute of repose, CTS moved to\ndismiss the claim. That statute prevents subjecting a\ndefendant to a tort suit brought more than 10 years after\nthe last culpable act of the defendant. N. C. Gen. Stat.\nAnn. §1–52(16) (Lexis 2013) (“[N]o cause of action shall\naccrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of\nthe defendant giving rise to the cause of action”); Robinson\nv. Wadford, ___ N. C. App. ___, ___, 731 S. E. 2d 539, 541\n(2012) (referring to the provision as a “statute of repose”).\nBecause CTS’ last act occurred in 1987, when it sold the\nelectronics plant, the District Court accepted the recom­\nmendation of a Magistrate Judge and granted CTS’ motion\nto dismiss.\n    A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit reversed, ruling that §9658 pre-empted the statute\nof repose. 723 F. 3d 434 (2013). The majority found §9658\n“ambiguous,” but also found that the interpretation in\nfavor of pre-emption was preferable because of CERCLA’s\nremedial purpose. Id., at 443–444.\n    Judge Thacker dissented. Id., at 445–454. She found\nthe statutory text’s exclusion of statutes of repose to be\n“plain and unambiguous.” Id., at 445. She further indi­\ncated that, even “if the preemptive effect of §9658 were\nsusceptible to two interpretations, a presumption against\npreemption would counsel that we should limit §9658’s\npreemptive reach to statutes of limitations without also\nextending it to statutes of repose.” Ibid.\n    The Courts of Appeals, as well as the Supreme Court of\nSouth Dakota, have rendered conflicting judgments on\nthis question.

Statutes of limitations and stat­\nutes of repose both are mechanisms used to limit the\ntemporal extent or duration of liability for tortious acts.\nBoth types of statute can operate to bar a plaintiff ’s suit,\nand in each instance time is the controlling factor. There\nis considerable common ground in the policies underlying\nthe two types of statute. But the time periods specified\nare measured from different points, and the statutes seek\nto attain different purposes and objectives. And, as will be\nexplained, §9658 mandates a distinction between the two.\n   In the ordinary course, a statute of limitations creates “a\ntime limit for suing in a civil case, based on the date when\nthe claim accrued.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1546 (9th ed.\n2009) (Black’s); see also Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life &\nAccident Ins. Co., 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4)\n(“As a general matter, a statute of limitations begins to\nrun when the cause of action ‘ “accrues” ’—that is, when\n‘the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief ’ ” (quoting Bay\nArea Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v.\nFerbar Corp. of Cal., Inc., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997))).\nMeasured by this standard, a claim accrues in a personal­\ninjury or property-damage action “when the injury oc­\ncurred or was discovered.” Black’s 1546. For example,\nNorth Carolina, whose laws are central to this case, has a\nstatute of limitations that allows a person three years to\nbring suit for personal injury or property damage, begin­\n6                CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nning on the date that damage “becomes apparent or ought\nreasonably to have become apparent to the claimant,\nwhichever event first occurs.” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §1–\n52(16).\n   A statute of repose, on the other hand, puts an outer\nlimit on the right to bring a civil action. That limit is\nmeasured not from the date on which the claim accrues\nbut instead from the date of the last culpable act or omis­\nsion of the defendant. A statute of repose “bar[s] any suit\nthat is brought after a specified time since the defendant\nacted (such as by designing or manufacturing a product),\neven if this period ends before the plaintiff has suffered a\nresulting injury.” Black’s 1546. The statute of repose\nlimit is “not related to the accrual of any cause of action;\nthe injury need not have occurred, much less have been\ndiscovered.” 54 C. J. S., Limitations of Actions §7, p. 24\n(2010) (hereinafter C. J. S.). The repose provision is there­\nfore equivalent to “a cutoff,” Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,\nPrupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, 363 (1991),\nin essence an “absolute . . . bar” on a defendant’s temporal\nliability, C. J. S. §7, at 24.\n   Although there is substantial overlap between the poli­\ncies of the two types of statute, each has a distinct purpose\nand each is targeted at a different actor. Statutes of limi­\ntations require plaintiffs to pursue “diligent prosecution of\nknown claims.” Black’s 1546. Statutes of limitations\n“promote justice by preventing surprises through [plain­\ntiffs’] revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber\nuntil evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and\nwitnesses have disappeared.” Railroad Telegraphers v.\nRailway Express Agency, Inc., 321 U. S. 342, 348–349\n(1944). Statutes of repose also encourage plaintiffs to\nbring actions in a timely manner, and for many of the\nsame reasons. But the rationale has a different emphasis.\nStatutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a\ndefendant should “be free from liability after the legisla­\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

United States Gypsum Co.,\n234 Va. 32, 37, 360 S. E. 2d 325, 328 (1987) (“[S]tatutes\nof repose reflect legislative decisions that as a matter of\npolicy there should be a specific time beyond which a\ndefendant should no longer be subjected to protracted\nliability” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Like a\ndischarge in bankruptcy, a statute of repose can be said to\nprovide a fresh start or freedom from liability. Indeed, the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause has been described as “a statute\nof repose” because it in part embodies the idea that at\nsome point a defendant should be able to put past events\nbehind him. Jones v. Thomas, 491 U. S. 376, 392 (1989)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   One central distinction between statutes of limitations\nand statutes of repose underscores their differing purposes.\nStatutes of limitations, but not statutes of repose, are\nsubject to equitable tolling, a doctrine that “pauses the\nrunning of, or ‘tolls,’ a statute of limitations when a liti­\ngant has pursued his rights diligently but some extraordi­\nnary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely\naction.” Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U. S. 1, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 7). Statutes of repose, on the other\nhand, generally may not be tolled, even in cases of ex­\ntraordinary circumstances beyond a plaintiff ’s control.\nSee, e.g., Lampf, supra, at 363 (“[A] period of repose [is]\ninconsistent with tolling”); 4 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal\nPractice and Procedure §1056, p. 240 (3d ed. 2002) (“[A]\ncritical distinction is that a repose period is fixed and its\nexpiration will not be delayed by estoppel or tolling”);\nRestatement (Second) of Torts §899, Comment g (1977).\n   Equitable tolling is applicable to statutes of limitations\nbecause their main thrust is to encourage the plaintiff to\n“pursu[e] his rights diligently,” and when an “extraordi­\nnary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely\naction,” the restriction imposed by the statute of limita­\n8                  CTS CORP. v.

But a statute of repose is a\njudgment that defendants should “be free from liability\nafter the legislatively determined period of time, beyond\nwhich the liability will no longer exist and will not be\ntolled for any reason.” C. J. S. §7, at 24. As an illustrative\nexample, under North Carolina law statutes of limitations\nmay be tolled but statutes of repose may not. See, e.g.,\nMonson v. Paramount Homes, Inc., 133 N. C. App. 235,\n239–241, 515 S. E. 2d 445, 449 (1999).\n                             B\n  The relevant provisions of §9658 and its definitions are\ncentral here, so the pre-emption directive is quoted in full:\n      “(a) State statutes of limitations for hazardous\n    substance cases\n\n         “(1) Exception to State statutes\n\n         “In the case of any action brought under State law\n      for personal injury, or property damages, which are\n      caused or contributed to by exposure to any hazardous\n      substance, or pollutant or contaminant, released into\n      the environment from a facility, if the applicable limi­\n      tations period for such action (as specified in the State\n      statute of limitations or under common law) provides\n      a commencement date which is earlier than the feder­\n      ally required commencement date, such period shall\n      commence at the federally required commencement\n      date in lieu of the date specified in such State statute.\n         “(2) State law generally applicable\n         “Except as provided in paragraph (1), the statute of\n      limitations established under State law shall apply in\n      all actions brought under State law for personal in-\n      jury, or property damages, which are caused or con­\n      tributed to by exposure to any hazardous substance,\n      or pollutant or contaminant, released into the envi­\n      ronment from a facility.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Though the suit was filed in 2011, more\n10               CTS CORP. v.

The Court of\nAppeals was in error when it treated this as a substitute\nfor a conclusion grounded in the statute’s text and struc­\nture. After all, almost every statute might be described as\nremedial in the sense that all statutes are designed to\nremedy some problem. And even if the Court identified\nsome subset of statutes as especially remedial, the Court\nhas emphasized that “no legislation pursues its purposes\nat all costs.” Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522,\n525–526 (1987) (per curiam). Congressional intent is\ndiscerned primarily from the statutory text. In any event,\nwere the Court to adopt a presumption to help resolve\nambiguity, substantial support also exists for the proposi­\ntion that “the States’ coordinate role in government coun­\nsels against reading” federal laws such as §9658 “to re­\nstrict the States’ sovereign capacity to regulate” in areas of\ntraditional state concern. FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health\nSystem, Inc., 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 18).\n   Turning to the statutory text, the Court notes first that\n§9658, in the caption of subsection (a), characterizes pre­\nemption as an “[e]xception” to the regular rule.\n§9658(a)(1). Section 9658 contains another subsection,\nwith the heading “State law generally applicable,” that\nprovides the rule that “the statute of limitations estab­\nlished under State law shall apply.” §9658(a)(2). Under\nthis structure, state law is not pre-empted unless it fits\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninto the precise terms of the exception.\n   The statute defines the “applicable limitations period,”\nthe “commencement date” of which is subject to pre­\nemption, as a period specified in “a statute of limitations.”\n§9658(b)(2). Indeed, §9658 uses the term “statute of limi­\ntations” four times (not including the caption), but not the\nterm “statute of repose.” This is instructive, but it is not\ndispositive. While the term “statute of limitations” has\nacquired a precise meaning, distinct from “statute of\nrepose,” and while that is its primary meaning, it must be\nacknowledged that the term “statute of limitations” is\nsometimes used in a less formal way. In that sense, it can\nrefer to any provision restricting the time in which a\nplaintiff must bring suit. See Black’s 1546; see also Ernst\n& Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 210 (1976). Con­\ngress has used the term “statute of limitations” when\nenacting statutes of repose. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §78u–\n6(h)(1)(B)(iii)(I)(aa) (2012 ed.) (creating a statute of repose\nand placing it in a provision entitled “Statute of limita­\ntions”); 42 U. S. C. §2278 (same). And petitioner does not\npoint out an example in which Congress has used the term\n“statute of repose.” So the Court must proceed to examine\nother evidence of the meaning of the term “statute of\nlimitations” as it is used in §9658. The parties debate the\nhistorical development of the terms “statute of limitations”\nand “statute of repose” in an effort to show how these\nterms were likely understood in 1986, when Congress\nenacted §9658. It is apparent that the distinction between\nstatutes of limitations and statutes of repose was under­\nstood by some courts and scholars before 1986. The 1977\nRestatement of Torts noted that “[i]n recent years special\n‘statutes of repose’ have been adopted in some states . . . .\nThe statutory period in these acts is usually longer than\nthat for the regular statute of limitations, but . . . may\nhave run before a cause of action came fully into exist­\nence.” Restatement (Second) of Torts §899, Comment g.\n12               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   But that usage, now predominant, then was not the only\ndefinition of the two terms. One scholar, writing in 1981,\ndescribed multiple usages of the terms, including both a\nusage in which the terms are equivalent and also the\nmodern, more precise usage. McGovern, The Variety,\nPolicy and Constitutionality of Product Liability Statutes\nof Repose, 30 Am. U. L. Rev. 579, 584 (1981) (describing a\nstatute of repose as “distinct from a statute of limitation\nbecause [a statute of repose] begins to run at a time unre­\nlated to the traditional accrual of the cause of action”).\n   Respondents note that an entry in Black’s Law Diction­\nary from 1979 describes a statute of limitations as follows:\n“Statutes of limitations are statutes of repose.” Black’s\n835 (5th ed.). That statement likely reflects an earlier,\nbroader usage in which the term “statute of repose” re­\nferred to all provisions delineating the time in which a\nplaintiff must bring suit. See, e.g., Pillow v. Roberts, 13\nHow. 472, 477 (1852) (“Statutes of limitation . . . are stat­\nutes of repose, and should not be evaded by a forced con­\nstruction”); Rosenberg v. North Bergen, 61 N. J. 190, 201,\n293 A. 2d 662, 667 (1972) (“All statutes limiting in any\nway the time within which a judicial remedy may be\nsought are statutes of repose”); Black’s 1077 (rev. 4th ed.\n1968) (defining “statute of limitations” as “[a] statute . . .\ndeclaring that no suit shall be maintained . . . unless\nbrought within a specified period after the right accrued.\nStatutes of limitation are statutes of repose”); Ballentine’s\nLaw Dictionary 1233 (2d ed. 1948) (similar). That usage\ndoes not necessarily support respondents’ interpretation,\nbecause the broad usage of the term “statute of repose”\ndoes not mean that the term “statute of limitations” must\nrefer to both types of statute.\n   From all this, it is apparent that general usage of the\nlegal terms has not always been precise, but the concept\nthat statutes of repose and statutes of limitations are\ndistinct was well enough established to be reflected in the\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1982 Study Group Report, commissioned by Congress. In\none of its recommendations, the Study Group Report\ncalled on States to adopt the discovery rule now embodied\nin §9658. Study Group Report, pt. 1, at 256. The Report\nacknowledged that statutes of repose were not equivalent\nto statutes of limitations and that a recommendation to\npre-empt the latter did not necessarily include the former.\nFor immediately it went on to state: “The Recommenda­\ntion is intended also to cover the repeal of the statutes of\nrepose which, in a number of states[,] have the same effect\nas some statutes of limitation in barring [a] plaintiff ’s\nclaim before he knows that he has one.” Ibid. The schol­\nars and professionals who were discussing this matter\n(and indeed were advising Congress) knew of a clear dis­\ntinction between the two.\n   The Report clearly urged the repeal of statutes of repose\nas well as statutes of limitations. But in so doing the\nReport did what the statute does not: It referred to stat­\nutes of repose as a distinct category. And when Congress\ndid not make the same distinction, it is proper to conclude\nthat Congress did not exercise the full scope of its pre­\nemption power.\n   While the use of the term “statute of limitations” in\n§9658 is not dispositive, the Court’s textual inquiry does\nnot end there, for other features of the statutory text\nfurther support the exclusion of statutes of repose. The\ntext of §9658 includes language describing the covered\nperiod in the singular. The statute uses the terms “the\napplicable limitations period,” “such period shall com­\nmence,” and “the statute of limitations established under\nState law.” This would be an awkward way to mandate\nthe pre-emption of two different time periods with two\ndifferent purposes.\n   True, the Dictionary Act states that “words importing\nthe singular include and apply to several persons, parties,\nor things” unless “the context indicates otherwise.” 1\n14               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. §1. But the Court has relied on this directive\nwhen the rule is “ ‘necessary to carry out the evident intent\nof the statute.’ ” United States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415,\n422, n. 5 (2009) (quoting First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v.\nMissouri, 263 U. S. 640, 657 (1924)). As discussed, the\ncontext here shows an evident intent not to cover statutes\nof repose.\n   Further, to return again to the definition of the “appli­\ncable limitations period,” the statute describes it as “the\nperiod” during which a “civil action” under state law “may\nbe brought.” §9658(b)(2). It is true that in a literal sense\na statute of repose limits the time during which a suit\n“may be brought” because it provides a point after which a\nsuit cannot be brought. Ibid.; see C. J. S. §7, at 24 (“A\nstatute of repose . . . limits the time within which an\naction may be brought”). But the definition of the “appli­\ncable limitations period” presupposes that “a [covered]\ncivil action” exists. §9658(b)(2). Black’s Law Dictionary\ndefines a “civil action” as identical to an “action at law,”\nwhich in relevant part is defined as a “civil suit stating a\nlegal cause of action.” Black’s 32–33, 279 (9th ed. 2009);\nsee also id., at 222 (5th ed. 1979).\n   A statute of repose, however, as noted above, “is not\nrelated to the accrual of any cause of action.” C. J. S. §7,\nat 24. Rather, it mandates that there shall be no cause of\naction beyond a certain point, even if no cause of action\nhas yet accrued. Thus, a statute of repose can prohibit a\ncause of action from coming into existence. See, e.g., N. C.\nGen. Stat. Ann. §1–52(16) (“[N]o cause of action shall\naccrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of\nthe defendant giving rise to the cause of action”); see also\nHargett v. Holland, 337 N. C. 651, 654–655, 447 S. E. 2d\n784, 787 (1994) (“A statute of repose creates an additional\nelement of the claim itself which must be satisfied in order\nfor the claim to be maintained . . . . If the action is not\nbrought within the specified period, the plaintiff literally\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhas no cause of action” (internal quotation marks omit­\nted)); Lamb v. Wedgewood South Corp., 308 N. C. 419,\n440–441, 302 S. E. 2d 868, 880 (1983). A statute of repose\ncan be said to define the scope of the cause of action, and\ntherefore the liability of the defendant. See Hargett,\nsupra, at 655–656, 447 S. E. 2d, at 788.\n   In light of the distinct purpose for statutes of repose, the\ndefinition of “applicable limitations period” (and thus also\nthe definition of “commencement date”) in §9658(b)(2) is\nbest read to encompass only statutes of limitations, which\ngenerally begin to run after a cause of action accrues and\nso always limit the time in which a civil action “may be\nbrought.” A statute of repose, however, may preclude an\nalleged tortfeasor’s liability before a plaintiff is entitled to\nsue, before an actionable harm ever occurs.\n   Another and altogether unambiguous textual indication\nthat §9658 does not pre-empt statutes of repose is that\n§9658 provides for equitable tolling for “minor or incompe­\ntent plaintiff[s].” §9658(b)(4)(B). As noted in the preced­\ning discussion, a “critical distinction” between statutes of\nlimitations and statutes of repose “is that a repose period\nis fixed and its expiration will not be delayed by estoppel\nor tolling.” 4 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§1056, at 240. As a consequence, the inclusion of a tolling\nrule in §9658 suggests that the statute’s reach is limited to\nstatutes of limitations, which traditionally have been\nsubject to tolling. It would be odd for Congress, if it did\nseek to pre-empt statutes of repose, to pre-empt not just\nthe commencement date of statutes of repose but also\nstate law prohibiting tolling of statutes of repose—all\nwithout an express indication that §9658 was intended to\nreach the latter.\n   In addition to their argument that §9658 expressly pre­\nempts statutes of repose, respondents contend that §9658\neffects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose\n“creat[e] an unacceptable ‘obstacle to the accomplishment\n16               CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                    Opinion of Kthe Court\n                     Opinion of ENNEDY, J.\n\nand execution of the full purposes and objectives of Con­\ngress.’ ” Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 563–564 (2009)\n(quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)).\nRespondents argue that pre-emption of statutes of repose\nadvances §9658’s purpose, namely to help plaintiffs bring\ntort actions for harm caused by toxic contaminants.\n  But the level of generality at which the statute’s pur­\npose is framed affects the judgment whether a specific\nreading will further or hinder that purpose. CERCLA, it\nmust be remembered, does not provide a complete reme-\ndial framework. The statute does not provide a general\ncause of action for all harm caused by toxic contaminants.\nSection 9658 leaves untouched States’ judgments about\ncauses of action, the scope of liability, the duration of the\nperiod provided by statutes of limitations, burdens of\nproof, rules of evidence, and other important rules govern­\ning civil actions. “ ‘The case for federal pre-emption is\nparticularly weak where Congress has indicated its\nawareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal\ninterest, and has nonetheless decided to stand by both\nconcepts and to tolerate whatever tension there [is] be­\ntween them.’ ” Wyeth, supra, at 574–575 (quoting Bonito\nBoats v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 166–167\n(1989)). Respondents have not shown that in light of\nCongress’ decision to leave those many areas of state law\nuntouched, statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obsta­\ncle to the attainment of CERCLA’s purposes.\n                            D\n   Under a proper interpretation of §9658, statutes of\nrepose are not within Congress’ pre-emption mandate.\nAlthough the natural reading of §9658’s text is that stat­\nutes of repose are excluded, the Court finds additional\nsupport for its conclusion in well-established “presump­\ntions about the nature of pre-emption.” Medtronic, Inc. v.\nLohr, 518 U. S. 470, 484–485 (1996) (citing Gade v. Na-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 111\n(1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment)).\n   “[B]ecause the States are independent sovereigns in our\nfederal system,” the Court “ ‘assum[es] that the historic\npolice powers of the States were not to be superseded by\nthe Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest\npurpose of Congress.’ ” Medtronic, supra, at 485 (quoting\nRice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947)).\n   It follows that “when the text of a pre-emption clause is\nsusceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts\nordinarily ‘accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption.’ ”\nAltria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S. 70, 77 (2008) (quoting\nBates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 449 (2005)).\nThat approach is “consistent with both federalism con­\ncerns and the historic primacy of state regulation of mat­\nters of health and safety.” Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 485.\n   The effect of that presumption is to support, where\nplausible, “a narrow interpretation” of an express pre­\nemption provision, ibid., especially “when Congress has\nlegislated in a field traditionally occupied by the States,”\nAltria, supra, at 77. The presumption has greatest force\nwhen Congress legislates in an area traditionally governed\nby the States’ police powers. See Rice, supra, at 230. “In\nour federal system, there is no question that States pos­\nsess the ‘traditional authority to provide tort remedies to\ntheir citizens’ as they see fit.” Wos v. E. M.

I\ndo not join that Part because I remain convinced that\n“[t]he proper rule of construction for express pre-emption\nprovisions is . . . the one that is customary for statutory\nprovisions in general: Their language should be given its\nordinary meaning.” Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505\nU. S. 504, 548 (1992) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\nin part and dissenting in part). The contrary notion—\nthat express pre-emption provisions must be construed\nnarrowly—was “extraordinary and unprecedented” when\nthis Court announced it two decades ago, id., at 544, and\nsince then our reliance on it has been sporadic at best, see\nAltria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S. 70, 99–103 (2008)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting). For the reasons given in the\nbalance of the opinion, ordinary principles of statutory\nconstruction demonstrate that 42 U. S. C. §9658 pre-empts\nonly statutes of limitation and not statutes of repose.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

PETER \n\n              WALDBURGER ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 9, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,\ndissenting.\n  North Carolina’s law prescribing “periods . . . for the\ncommencement of actions [for personal injury or damage\nto property],” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§1–46, 1–52 (Lexis\n2013), includes in the same paragraph, §1–52(16), both a\ndiscovery rule and an absolute period of repose. Section\n1–52(16) states that personal injury and property damage\nclaims\n    “shall not accrue until bodily harm to the claimant or\n    physical damage to his property becomes apparent or\n    ought reasonably to have become apparent to the\n    claimant . . . . Provided that no [claim] shall accrue\n    more than 10 years from the last act or omission of\n    the defendant giving rise to the [claim].”\nThe question presented is whether a federal statute on the\ntimeliness of suits for harm caused by environmental\ncontamination, 42 U. S. C. §9658, preempts North Caroli-\nna’s 10-year repose provision.\n  The federal statute concerns hazardous-waste-caused\ninjuries with long latency periods that can run 10 to 40\nyears. To ensure that latent injury claims would not\nbecome time barred during the years in which the injury\nremained without manifestation, Congress amended the\n2                CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,\nand Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U. S. C. §9601\net seq., to include a provision, §9658, on “actions under\nstate law for damages from exposure to hazardous sub-\nstances.” See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99–962, pp. 87–88, 261\n(1986) (hereinafter Conference Report) (problem centers\non when state limitations periods begin to run rather than\nthe number of years they run; Congress therefore estab-\nlished “a [f]ederally-required commencement date”).\nCaptioned “Exception to State statutes,” §9658(a)(1) in-\nstructs that when the applicable state limitations period\nspecifies “a commencement date . . . earlier than the fed-\nerally required commencement date,” the federal date\nshall apply “in lieu of the date specified in [state law].”\n   The Court in the case at hand identifies as the relevant\nprescriptive period North Carolina’s 10-year repose provi-\nsion. I agree. But as I see it, the later “federally required\ncommencement date,” §9658(a)(1), (b)(4), displaces the\nearlier date state law prescribes.\n   Section 9658(b)(3) defines “commencement date” as “the\ndate specified in a statute of limitations as the beginning\nof the applicable limitations period.” Under North Caro-\nlina law, that date is determined by the occurrence of\n“the last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to\nthe [claim].” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 1–52(16). The defini-\ntion key to this controversy, however, appears in\n§9658(b)(4)(A): “ ‘[F]ederally required commencement date’\nmeans the date the plaintiff knew (or reasonably should\nhave known) that [her] injury . . . [was] caused . . . by the\nhazardous substance . . . concerned.” Congress, in short,\ndirected, in §9658(a)(1), that the federally prescribed\ndiscovery rule, set out in §9658(b)(4), shall apply “in lieu\nof ” the earlier “commencement date” (the defendant’s\n“last act or omission”) specified in N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n§1–52(16).\n   Why does the Court fight this straightforward reading?\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nAt length, the Court’s opinion distinguishes statutes of\nlimitations from statutes of repose. See ante, at 5–16. Yet\nNorth Carolina itself made its repose period a component\nof the statute prescribing periods for “the commencement\nof actions.” §§1–46, 1–52(16). What is a repose period, in\nessence, other than a limitations period unattended by a\ndiscovery rule? See Senate Committee on Environment\nand Public Works, Superfund Section 301(e) Study Group,\nInjuries and Damages from Hazardous Wastes—Analysis\nand Improvement of Legal Remedies, 97th Cong., 2d Sess.,\n(pt. 1) 255–256 (Comm. Print 1982) (hereinafter Study\nGroup Report).\n   The legislative history of §9658, moreover, shows why\nthe distinction the Court draws between statutes of limita-\ntions and repose prescriptions cannot be what Congress\nordered. As the Court recognizes, ante, at 2–3, Congress\namended CERCLA to include §9658 in response to the\nreport of an expert Study Group commissioned when\nCERCLA was enacted. That report directed its proposals\nto the States rather than to Congress. It “recommend[ed]\nthat the several states enhance and develop common law\nand statutory remedies, and that they remove unreasona-\nble procedural and other barriers to recovery in court\naction for personal injuries resulting from exposure to\nhazardous waste.” Study Group Report 255. The report\nthen made specific proposals. Under the heading “Stat-\nutes of Limitations,” the Study Group proposed (1) “that\nall [S]tates . . . clearly adopt the rule that an action ac-\ncrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discov-\nered the injury or disease and its cause” and (2) that\nStates repeal “statutes of repose which, in a number of\n[S]tates have the same effect as some statutes of limita-\ntion in barring plaintiff ’s claim before he knows he has\none.” Id., at 255–256. Both measures are necessary, the\nreport explained, because “many of the hazardous wastes\nare carcinogens” with “latency period[s] for the appearance\n4                   CTS CORP. v. WALDBURGER\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nof injury or disease . . . likely to [run] for thirty years or\nmore.” Id., at 255.\n  Beyond question, a repose period, like the 10-year period\nat issue here, will prevent recovery for injuries with la-\ntency periods running for decades. Thus, altering statutes\nof limitations to include a discovery rule would be of little\nuse in States with repose prescriptions.\n  Rather than await action by the States, Congress decid-\ned to implement the Study Group’s proposal itself by\nadopting §9658. Ante, at 3. The Conference Report re-\nlates the Study Group Report’s observation that “certain\nState statutes deprive plaintiffs of their day in court”\nbecause “[i]n the case of a long-latency disease, such as\ncancer,” a limitations period that begins to run before the\nplaintiff has discovered her injury frequently will make\ntimely suit impossible. Conference Report 261. The Con-\nference Report then states that “[t]his section”—§9658—\n“addresses the problem identified in the [Study Group\nReport].” Ibid. As the Study Group Report makes clear,\n“the problem” it identified, to which the Conference Report\nadverted, cannot be solved when statutes of repose remain\noperative. The Court’s interpretation thus thwarts Con-\ngress’ clearly expressed intent to fix “the problem” the\nStudy Group described.\n  In lieu of uniform application of the “federally required\ncommencement date,” §9658(b)(4), the Court allows those\nresponsible for environmental contamination, if they are\nlocated in the still small number of States with repose\nperiods,* to escape liability for the devastating harm they\ncause, harm hidden from detection for more than 10 years.\nInstead of encouraging prompt identification and remedia-\n——————\n  * See Conn.

I would affirm that court’s sound\njudgment.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2677566/", "sha1": "663da06281552a2fc94b1024f514b80a1c94b2b1", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-054", "time_retrieved": "2014-06-09T08:01:44.550865"}
