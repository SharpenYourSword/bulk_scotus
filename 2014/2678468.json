UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12–1493. Argued January 22, 2014—Decided June 16, 2014\nPetitioner Bruce Abramski offered to purchase a handgun for his uncle.\n  The form that federal regulations required Abramski to fill out (Form\n  4473) asked whether he was the “actual transferee/buyer” of the gun,\n  and clearly warned that a straw purchaser (namely, someone buying\n  a gun on behalf of another) was not the actual buyer. Abramski\n  falsely answered that he was the actual buyer. Abramski was con-\n  victed for knowingly making false statements “with respect to any\n  fact material to the lawfulness of the sale” of a gun, 18 U. S. C.\n  §922(a)(6), and for making a false statement “with respect to the in-\n  formation required . . . to be kept” in the gun dealer’s records,\n  §924(a)(1)(A). The Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Abramski’s misrepresentation is material under §922(a)(6).\n Pp. 7–22.\n       (a) Abramski contends that federal gun laws are entirely uncon-\n cerned with straw arrangements: So long as the person at the counter\n is eligible to own a gun, the sale to him is legal under the statute. To\n be sure, federal law regulates licensed dealer’s transactions with\n “persons” or “transferees” without specifying whether that language\n refers to the straw buyer or the actual purchaser. But when read in\n light of the statute’s context, structure, and purpose, it is clear this\n language refers to the true buyer rather than the straw. Federal gun\n law establishes an elaborate system of in-person identification and\n background checks to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of\n felons and other prohibited purchasers. §§922(c), 922(t). It also im-\n poses record-keeping requirements to assist law enforcement authori-\n ties in investigating serious crimes through the tracing of guns to\n their buyers. §922(b)(5), 923(g). These provisions would mean little\n2                    ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    if a would-be gun buyer could evade them all simply by enlisting the\n    aid of an intermediary to execute the paperwork on his behalf. The\n    statute’s language is thus best read in context to refer to the actual\n    rather than nominal buyer. This conclusion is reinforced by this\n    Court’s standard practice of focusing on practical realities rather\n    than legal formalities when identifying the parties to a transaction.\n    Pp. 7–19.\n          (b) Abramski argues more narrowly that his false response was\n    not material because his uncle could have legally bought a gun for\n    himself. But Abramski’s false statement prevented the dealer from\n    insisting that the true buyer (Alvarez) appear in person, provide\n    identifying information, show a photo ID, and submit to a back-\n    ground check. §§922(b), (c), (t). Nothing in the statute suggests that\n    these legal duties may be wiped away merely because the actual buy-\n    er turns out to be legally eligible to own a gun. Because the dealer\n    could not have lawfully sold the gun had it known that Abramski was\n    not the true buyer, the misstatement was material to the lawfulness\n    of the sale. Pp. 19–22.\n       2. Abramski’s misrepresentation about the identity of the actual\n    buyer concerned “information required by [Chapter 44 of Title 18 of\n    the United States Code] to be kept” in the dealer’s records.\n    §924(a)(1)(A). Chapter 44 contains a provision requiring a dealer to\n    “maintain such records . . . as the Attorney General may . . . pre-\n    scribe.” §923(g)(1)(A). The Attorney General requires every licensed\n    dealer to retain in its records a completed copy of Form 4473, see 27\n    CFR §478.124(b), and that form in turn includes the “actual buyer”\n    question that Abramski answered falsely. Therefore, falsely answer-\n    ing a question on Form 4473 violates §924(a)(1)(A).

To ensure the accuracy of those sub-\nmissions, a federal statute imposes criminal penalties on\nany person who, in connection with a firearm’s acquisition,\nmakes false statements about “any fact material to the\nlawfulness of the sale.” 18 U. S. C. §922(a)(6). In this\ncase, we consider how that law applies to a so-called straw\npurchaser—namely, a person who buys a gun on someone\nelse’s behalf while falsely claiming that it is for himself.\nWe hold that such a misrepresentation is punishable\nunder the statute, whether or not the true buyer could\nhave purchased the gun without the straw.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Federal law has for over 40 years regulated sales by\nlicensed firearms dealers, principally to prevent guns from\nfalling into the wrong hands. See Gun Control Act of\n1968, 18 U. S. C. §921 et seq. Under §922(g), certain classes\n2                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nof people—felons, drug addicts, and the mentally ill, to\nlist a few—may not purchase or possess any firearm. And\nto ensure they do not, §922(d) forbids a licensed dealer\nfrom selling a gun to anyone it knows, or has reasonable\ncause to believe, is such a prohibited buyer. See Huddle-\nston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 825 (1974) (“[T]he\nfocus of the federal scheme,” in controlling access to weap-\nons, “is the federally licensed firearms dealer”).\n   The statute establishes a detailed scheme to enable the\ndealer to verify, at the point of sale, whether a potential\nbuyer may lawfully own a gun. Section 922(c) brings the\nwould-be purchaser onto the dealer’s “business premises”\nby prohibiting, except in limited circumstances, the sale of\na firearm “to a person who does not appear in person” at\nthat location. Other provisions then require the dealer to\ncheck and make use of certain identifying information\nreceived from the buyer. Before completing any sale, the\ndealer must “verif[y] the identity of the transferee by\nexamining a valid identification document” bearing a\nphotograph. §922(t)(1)(C). In addition, the dealer must\nprocure the buyer’s “name, age, and place of residence.”\n§922(b)(5). And finally, the dealer must (with limited\nexceptions not at issue here1) submit that information\nto the National Instant Background Check System (NICS)\nto determine whether the potential purchaser is for\nany reason disqualified from owning a firearm. See\n§§922(t)(1)(A)–(B).\n   The statute further insists that the dealer keep certain\nrecords, to enable federal authorities both to enforce the\nlaw’s verification measures and to trace firearms used in\ncrimes. See H. R. Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 14\n\n——————\n    1 The\n        principal exception is for any buyer who has a state permit that\nhas been “issued only after an authorized government official has\nverified” the buyer’s eligibility to own a gun under both federal and\nstate law. §922(t)(3).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)              3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(1968). A dealer must maintain the identifying infor-\nmation mentioned above (i.e., name, age, and residence) in\nits permanent files. See §922(b)(5). In addition, the dealer\nmust keep “such records of . . . sale[ ] or other disposi-\ntion of firearms . . . as the Attorney General may by regu-\nlations prescribe.” §923(g)(1)(A). And the Attorney Gen-\neral (or his designee) may obtain and inspect any of those\nrecords, “in the course of a bona fide criminal investiga-\ntion,” to “determin[e] the disposition of 1 or more fire-\narms.” §923(g)(7).\n   To implement all those statutory requirements, the\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\n(ATF) developed Form 4473 for gun sales. See Supp. App.\n1–6. The part of that form to be completed by the buyer\nrequests his name, birth date, and address, as well as\ncertain other identifying information (for example, his\nheight, weight, and race). The form further lists all the\nfactors disqualifying a person from gun ownership, and\nasks the would-be buyer whether any of them apply (e.g.,\n“[h]ave you ever been convicted . . . of a felony?”). Id., at 1.\nMost important here, Question 11.a. asks (with bolded\nemphasis appearing on the form itself):\n    “Are you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s)\n    listed on this form? Warning: You are not the ac-\n    tual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on\n    behalf of another person. If you are not the ac-\n    tual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the fire-\n    arm(s) to you.” Ibid.\nThe accompanying instructions for that question provide:\n    “Question 11.a. Actual Transferee/Buyer: For\n    purposes of this form, you are the actual transferee/\n    buyer if you are purchasing the firearm for yourself\n    or otherwise acquiring the firearm for yourself . . . .\n    You are also the actual transferee/buyer if you are le-\n    gitimately purchasing the firearm as a gift for a third\n4               ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    party. ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER EXAM-\n    PLES: Mr. Smith asks Mr. Jones to purchase a fire-\n    arm for Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith gives Mr. Jones the\n    money for the firearm. Mr. Jones is NOT THE\n    ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER of the firearm\n    and must answer “NO” to question 11.a.” Id., at 4.\nAfter responding to this and other questions, the customer\nmust sign a certification declaring his answers “true,\ncorrect and complete.” Id., at 2. That certification pro-\nvides that the signator “understand[s] that making any\nfalse . . . statement” respecting the transaction—and,\nparticularly, “answering ‘yes’ to question 11.a. if [he is] not\nthe actual buyer”—is a crime “punishable as a felony\nunder Federal law.” Ibid. (bold typeface deleted).\n  Two statutory provisions, each designed to ensure that\nthe dealer can rely on the truthfulness of the buyer’s dis-\nclosures in carrying out its obligations, criminalize certain\nfalse statements about firearms transactions. First and\nforemost, §922(a)(6), provides as follows:\n    “It shall be unlawful . . . for any person in connection\n    with the acquisition or attempted acquisition of any\n    firearm or ammunition from [a licensed dealer] know-\n    ingly to make any false or fictitious oral or written\n    statement . . . , intended or likely to deceive such\n    [dealer] with respect to any fact material to the law-\n    fulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm\n    or ammunition under the provisions of this chapter.”\nThat provision helps make certain that a dealer will re-\nceive truthful information as to any matter relevant to a\ngun sale’s legality. In addition, §924(a)(1)(A) prohibits\n“knowingly mak[ing] any false statement or representa-\ntion with respect to the information required by this chap-\nter to be kept in the records” of a federally licensed gun\ndealer. The question in this case is whether, as the ATF\ndeclares in Form 4473’s certification, those statutory\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovisions criminalize a false answer to Question 11.a.—\nthat is, a customer’s statement that he is the “actual\ntransferee/buyer,” purchasing a firearm for himself, when\nin fact he is a straw purchaser, buying the gun on someone\nelse’s behalf.\n                              B\n   The petitioner here is Bruce Abramski, a former police\nofficer who offered to buy a Glock 19 handgun for his\nuncle, Angel Alvarez. (Abramski thought he could get the\ngun for a discount by showing his old police identification,\nthough the Government contends that because he had\nbeen fired from his job two years earlier, he was no longer\nauthorized to use that card.) Accepting his nephew’s offer,\nAlvarez sent Abramski a check for $400 with “Glock 19\nhandgun” written on the memo line. Two days later,\nAbramski went to Town Police Supply, a federally licensed\nfirearms dealer, to make the purchase. There, he filled\nout Form 4473, falsely checking “Yes” in reply to Question\n11.a.—that is, asserting he was the “actual transferee/\nbuyer” when, according to the form’s clear definition, he\nwas not. He also signed the requisite certification, ac-\nknowledging his understanding that a false answer to\nQuestion 11.a. is a federal crime. After Abramski’s name\ncleared the NICS background check, the dealer sold him\nthe Glock. Abramski then deposited the $400 check in his\nbank account, transferred the gun to Alvarez, and got back\na receipt. Federal agents found that receipt while execut-\ning a search warrant at Abramski’s home after he became\na suspect in a different crime.\n   A grand jury indicted Abramski for violating §§922(a)(6)\nand 924(a)(1)(A) by falsely affirming in his response to\nQuestion 11.a. that he was the Glock’s actual buyer.\nAbramski moved to dismiss both charges. He argued that\nhis misrepresentation on Question 11.a. was not “material\nto the lawfulness of the sale” under §922(a)(6) because\n6                 ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nAlvarez was legally eligible to own a gun. And he claimed\nthat the false statement did not violate §924(a)(1)(A)\nbecause a buyer’s response to Question 11.a. is not “re-\nquired . . . to be kept in the records” of a gun dealer. After\nthe District Court denied those motions, see 778 F. Supp.\n2d 678 (WD Va. 2011), Abramski entered a conditional\nguilty plea, reserving his right to challenge the rulings.\nThe District Court then sentenced him to five years of\nprobation on each count, running concurrently.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the\nconvictions. 706 F. 3d 307 (2013). It noted a division\namong appellate courts on the question Abramski raised\nabout §922(a)(6)’s materiality requirement: Of three courts\nto have addressed the issue, one agreed with Abramski\nthat a misrepresentation on Question 11.a. is immaterial\nif “the true purchaser [here, Alvarez] can lawfully pur-\nchase a firearm directly.” Id., at 315 (quoting United\nStates v. Polk, 118 F. 3d 286, 295 (CA5 1997)).2 The\nFourth Circuit, however, thought the majority position\ncorrect: “[T]he identity of the actual purchaser of a firearm\nis a constant that is always material to the lawfulness of a\nfirearm acquisition under §922(a)(6).” 706 F. 3d, at 316.\nThe court also held that Abramski’s conviction under\n§924(a)(1)(A) was valid, finding that the statute required a\ndealer to maintain the information at issue in its records.\nId., at 317.\n   We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013), principally\nto resolve the Circuit split about §922(a)(6). In this Court,\nAbramski renews his claim that a false answer to Ques-\ntion 11.a. is immaterial if the true buyer is legally eligible\nto purchase a firearm. But Abramski now focuses on a\n——————\n  2 Compare Polk, 118 F. 3d, at 294–295, with United States v. Morales,\n\n687 F. 3d 697, 700–701 (CA6 2012) (a misrepresentation about the true\npurchaser’s identity is material even when he can legally own a gun);\nUnited States v.

See Brief for Petitioner i.3\nIn brief, he alleges that a false response to Question 11.a.\nis never material to a gun sale’s legality, whether or not\nthe actual buyer is eligible to own a gun. We begin with\nthat fundamental question, next turn to what has become\nAbramski’s back-up argument under §922(a)(6), and fi-\nnally consider the relatively easy question pertaining to\n§924(A)(1)(a)’s separate false-statement prohibition. On\neach score, we affirm Abramski’s conviction.\n                             II\n  Abramski’s broad theory (mostly echoed by the dissent)\nis that federal gun law simply does not care about ar-\nrangements involving straw purchasers: So long as the\nperson at the counter is eligible to own a gun, the sale to\nhim is legal under the statute. That is true, Abramski\ncontends, irrespective of any agreement that person has\nmade to purchase the firearm on behalf of someone else—\nincluding someone who cannot lawfully buy or own a gun\nhimself.    Accordingly, Abramski concludes, his “false\nstatement that he was the [Glock 19’s] ‘actual buyer,’ ” as\nthat term was “defined in Question 11.a., was not material”\n—indeed, was utterly irrelevant—“to the lawfulness of\nthe sale.” Id., at 31 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 4\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.). In essence, he claims, Town Police\nSupply could legally have sold the gun to him even if had\ntruthfully answered Question 11.a. by disclosing that he\nwas a straw—because, again, all the federal firearms law\ncares about is whether the individual standing at the\n\n——————\n  3 Reflecting that prior consensus, neither of Abramski’s principal\n\namici—the National Rifle Association and a group of 26 States—joins\nAbramski in making this broader argument. They confine themselves\nto supporting the more limited claim about straw purchases made on\nbehalf of eligible gun owners, addressed infra, at 19–22.\n8                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndealer’s counter meets the requirements to buy a gun.4\n   At its core, that argument relies on one true fact: Fed-\neral gun law regulates licensed dealers’ transactions with\n“persons” or “transferees,” without specifically referencing\nstraw purchasers. Section 922(d), for example, bars a\ndealer from “sell[ing] or otherwise dispos[ing] of ” a fire-\narm to any “person” who falls within a prohibited category—\nfelons, drug addicts, the mentally ill, and so forth. See\nsupra, at 1–2; see also §922(b)(5) (before selling a gun to a\n“person,” the dealer must take down his name, age, and\nresidence); §922(t)(1) (before selling a gun to a “person,”\nthe dealer must run a background check). Similarly,\n§922(t)(1)(C) requires the dealer to verify the identity of\nthe “transferee” by checking a valid photo ID. See supra,\nat 2; see also §922(c) (spelling out circumstances in which\na “transferee” may buy a gun without appearing at the\ndealer’s premises). Abramski contends that Congress’s\nuse of such language alone, sans any mention of “straw\npurchasers” or “actual buyers,” shows that “[i]t is not\nillegal to buy a gun for someone else.” Brief for Petitioner\n15–16; Reply Brief 1; see also post, at 2–6.\n——————\n   4 The dissent reserves the question whether the false statement\n\nwould be material if the straw purchaser knew that the true buyer was\nnot eligible to own a firearm. Post, at 6, n. 2. But first, that reserva-\ntion is of quite limited scope: Unlike Abramski’s back-up argument,\nwhich imposes liability whenever the true purchaser cannot legally buy\na gun, the dissent’s reservation applies only when the straw has\nknowledge of (or at least reasonable cause to believe) that fact. And as\nwe will later note, straws often do not have such knowledge. See infra,\nat 12–13. Second, the reservation (fairly enough for a reservation) rests\non an uncertain legal theory. According to the dissent, a straw buyer\nmight violate §922(a)(6) if a dealer’s sale to him aids and abets his\nviolation of §922(d)—a provision barring knowingly transferring a gun\nto an ineligible person, see infra, at 8, 17–18. But that reasoning\npresupposes that a firearms dealer acting in the ordinary course of\nbusiness can ever have the intent needed to aid and abet a crime—a\nquestion this Court reserved not six months ago. See Rosemond v.\nUnited States, 572 U. S. ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12, n. 8).\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  But that language merely raises, rather than answers,\nthe critical question: In a straw purchase, who is the\n“person” or “transferee” whom federal gun law addresses?\nIs that “person” the middleman buying a firearm on some-\none else’s behalf (often because the ultimate recipient\ncould not buy it himself, or wants to camouflage the trans-\naction)? Or is that “person” instead the individual really\npaying for the gun and meant to take possession of it upon\ncompletion of the purchase? Is it the conduit at the coun-\nter, or the gun’s intended owner?5 In answering that in-\nquiry, we must (as usual) interpret the relevant words not\nin a vacuum, but with reference to the statutory context,\n“structure, history, and purpose.” Maracich v. Spears, 570\nU. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 26). All those tools of\ndivining meaning—not to mention common sense, which is\na fortunate (though not inevitable) side-benefit of constru-\ning statutory terms fairly—demonstrate that §922, in\nregulating licensed dealers’ gun sales, looks through the\nstraw to the actual buyer.6\n——————\n  5 The dissent claims the answer is easy because “if I give my son $10\n\nand tell him to pick up milk and eggs at the store, no English speaker\nwould say that the store ‘sells’ the milk and eggs to me.” Post, at 4.\nBut try a question more similar to the one the gun law’s text raises: If I\nsend my brother to the Apple Store with money and instructions to\npurchase an iPhone, and then take immediate and sole possession of\nthat device, am I the “person” (or “transferee”) who has bought the\nphone or is he? Nothing in ordinary English usage compels an answer\neither way.\n  6 Contrary to the dissent’s view, our analysis does not rest on mere\n\n“purpose-based arguments.” Post. at 7. We simply recognize that a\ncourt should not interpret each word in a statute with blinders on,\nrefusing to look at the word’s function within the broader statutory\ncontext. As we have previously put the point, a “provision that may\nseem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the\nstatutory scheme . . . because only one of the permissible meanings\nproduces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the\nlaw.” United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates,\nLtd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988).\n10                 ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  The overarching reason is that Abramski’s reading\nwould undermine—indeed, for all important purposes,\nwould virtually repeal—the gun law’s core provisions.7 As\nnoted earlier, the statute establishes an elaborate system\nto verify a would-be gun purchaser’s identity and check on\nhis background. See supra, at 2. It also requires that the\ninformation so gathered go into a dealer’s permanent\nrecords. See supra, at 2–3. The twin goals of this com-\nprehensive scheme are to keep guns out of the hands of\ncriminals and others who should not have them, and to\nassist law enforcement authorities in investigating serious\ncrimes. See Huddleston, 415 U. S., at 824; supra, at 2–3.\nAnd no part of that scheme would work if the statute\nturned a blind eye to straw purchases—if, in other words,\nthe law addressed not the substance of a transaction, but\nonly empty formalities.\n  To see why, consider what happens in a typical straw\npurchase. A felon or other person who cannot buy or own\na gun still wants to obtain one. (Or, alternatively, a per-\nson who could legally buy a firearm wants to conceal his\npurchase, maybe so he can use the gun for criminal pur-\nposes without fear that police officers will later trace it to\nhim.) Accordingly, the prospective buyer enlists an inter-\nmediary to help him accomplish his illegal aim. Perhaps\nhe conscripts a loyal friend or family member; perhaps\nmore often, he hires a stranger to purchase the gun for a\nprice. The actual purchaser might even accompany the\nstraw to the gun shop, instruct him which firearm to buy,\ngive him the money to pay at the counter, and take pos-\nsession as they walk out the door. See, e.g., United States\n——————\n   7 That reading would also, at a stroke, declare unlawful a large part\n\nof what the ATF does to combat gun trafficking by criminals. See Dept.\nof Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, Following the\nGun: Enforcing Federal Laws Against Firearms Traffickers, p. xi (June\n2000) (noting that in several prior years “[a]lmost half of all [ATF\nfirearm] trafficking investigations involved straw purchasers”).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nv. Bowen, 207 Fed. Appx. 727, 729 (CA7 2006) (describing\na straw purchase along those lines); United States v. Paye,\n129 Fed. Appx. 567, 570 (CA11 2005) (per curiam) (same).\nWhat the true buyer would not do—what he would leave\nto the straw, who possesses the gun for all of a minute—is\ngive his identifying information to the dealer and submit\nhimself to a background check. How many of the statute’s\nprovisions does that scenario—the lawful result of\nAbramski’s (and the dissent’s) reading of “transferee” and\n“person”—render meaningless?\n   Start with the parts of §922 enabling a dealer to verify\nwhether a buyer is legally eligible to own a firearm. That\ntask, as noted earlier, begins with identification—\nrequesting the name, address, and age of the potential\npurchaser and checking his photo ID. See §§922(b)(5),\n(t)(1)(C); supra, at 2. And that identification in turn per-\nmits a background check: The dealer runs the purchaser’s\nname through the NICS database to discover whether he\nis, for example, a felon, drug addict, or mentally ill person.\nSee §§922(d), (t)(1); supra, at 2. All those provisions are\ndesigned to accomplish what this Court has previously\ntermed Congress’s “principal purpose” in enacting the\nstatute—“to curb crime by keeping ‘firearms out of the\nhands of those not legally entitled to possess them.’ ”\nHuddleston, 415 U. S., at 824 (quoting S. Rep. No. 1501,\n90th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1968)). But under Abramski’s\nreading, the statutory terms would be utterly ineffectual,\nbecause the identification and background check would be\nof the wrong person. The provisions would evaluate the\neligibility of mere conduits, while allowing every criminal\n(and drug addict and so forth) to escape that assessment\nand walk away with a weapon.\n   Similarly, Abramski’s view would defeat the point of\n§922(c), which tightly restricts the sale of guns “to a per-\nson who does not appear in person at the licensee’s busi-\nness premises.” See supra, at 2. Only a narrow class of\n12              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprospective buyers may ever purchase a gun from afar—\nprimarily, individuals who have already had their eligibil-\nity to own a firearm verified by state law enforcement\nofficials with access to the NICS database. See 27 CFR\n§478.96(b) (2014), 18 U. S. C. §922(t)(3); n. 1, supra. And\neven when an individual fits within that category, he still\nmust submit to the dealer a sworn statement that he can\nlawfully own a gun, as well as provide the name and ad-\ndress of the principal law enforcement officer in his com-\nmunity. See §922(c)(1). The dealer then has to forward\nnotice of the sale to that officer, in order to allow law\nenforcement authorities to investigate the legality of the\nsale and, if necessary, call a stop to it. See §§922(c)(2)–(3).\nThe provision thus prevents remote sales except to a small\nclass of buyers subject to extraordinary procedures—\nagain, to ensure effective verification of a potential pur-\nchaser’s eligibility. Yet on Abramski’s view, a person\ncould easily bypass the scheme, purchasing a gun without\never leaving his home by dispatching to a gun store a\nhired deliveryman. Indeed, if Abramski were right, we see\nno reason why anyone (and certainly anyone with less-\nthan-pure motives) would put himself through the proce-\ndures laid out in §922(c): Deliverymen, after all, are not so\nhard to come by.\n   And likewise, the statute’s record-keeping provisions\nwould serve little purpose if the records kept were of\nnominal rather than real buyers. As noted earlier, dealers\nmust store, and law enforcement officers may obtain,\ninformation about a gun buyer’s identity. See §§922(b)(5),\n923(g); supra, at 3. That information helps to fight serious\ncrime. When police officers retrieve a gun at a crime\nscene, they can trace it to the buyer and consider him as a\nsuspect. See National Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc. v.\nJones, 716 F. 3d 200, 204 (CADC 2013) (describing law\nenforcement’s use of firearm tracing). Too, the required\nrecords enable dealers to identify certain suspicious pur-\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nchasing trends, which they then must report to federal\nauthorities. See §923(g)(3) (imposing a reporting obliga-\ntion when a person buys multiple handguns within five\ndays). But once again, those provisions can serve their\nobjective only if the records point to the person who took\nactual control of the gun(s). Otherwise, the police will at\nmost learn the identity of an intermediary, who could not\nhave been responsible for the gun’s use and might know\nnext to nothing about the actual buyer. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Juarez, 626 F. 3d 246, 249 (CA5 2010) (straw\npurchaser bought military-style assault rifles, later found\namong Mexican gang members, for a buyer known “only as\n‘El Mano’ ”). Abramski’s view would thus render the re-\nquired records close to useless for aiding law enforcement:\nPutting true numbskulls to one side, anyone purchasing a\ngun for criminal purposes would avoid leaving a paper\ntrail by the simple expedient of hiring a straw.\n   To sum up so far: All the prerequisites for buying a gun\ndescribed above refer to a “person” or “transferee.” Read\nAbramski’s way (“the man at the counter”), those terms\ndeny effect to the regulatory scheme, as criminals could\nalways use straw purchasers to evade the law.8 Read the\nother way (“the man getting, and always meant to get, the\nfirearm”), those terms give effect to the statutory provi-\n——————\n  8 The dissent is mistaken when it says that the ATF’s own former\n\nview of the statute refutes this proposition. See post, at 11–12. As we\nwill later discuss, see infra, at 21–22, the ATF for a time thought that\n§922(a)(6) did not cover cases in which the true purchaser could have\nlegally purchased a gun himself. But Abramski’s principal argument\nextends much further, to cases in which straws buy weapons for crimi-\nnals, drug addicts, and other prohibited purchasers. For the reasons\njust stated, that interpretation would render the statute all but useless.\nAnd although the dissent appeals to a snippet of congressional testi-\nmony to suggest that ATF once briefly held that extreme view of the\nstatute, it agrees that by at least 1979 (well over three decades ago),\nATF recognized the unlawfulness of straw purchases on behalf of\nprohibited persons.\n14              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsions, allowing them to accomplish their manifest objects.\nThat alone provides more than sufficient reason to under-\nstand “person” and “transferee” as referring not to the\nfictitious but to the real buyer.\n   And other language in §922 confirms that construction,\nby evincing Congress’s concern with the practical realities,\nrather than the legal niceties, of firearms transactions.\nFor example, §922(a)(6) itself bars material misrepresen-\ntations “in connection with the acquisition,” and not just\nthe purchase, of a firearm. That broader word, we have\npreviously held, does not focus on “legal title”—let alone\nlegal title for a few short moments, until another, always\nintended transfer occurs. Huddleston, 415 U. S., at 820.\nInstead, the term signifies “com[ing] into possession,\ncontrol, or power of disposal,” as the actual buyer in a\nstraw purchase does. Ibid. Similarly, we have reasoned\nthat such a substance-over-form approach draws support\nfrom the statute’s repeated references to “the sale or other\ndisposition” of a firearm. §922(a)(6); see §922(d) (making\nit unlawful to “sell or otherwise dispose of ” a gun to a\nprohibited person). That term, we have stated, “was\naimed at providing maximum coverage.” Id., at 826–827.\nWe think such expansive language inconsistent with\nAbramski’s view of the statute, which would stare myopi-\ncally at the nominal buyer while remaining blind to the\nperson exiting the transaction with control of the gun.\n   Finally, our reading of §922 comports with courts’\nstandard practice, evident in many legal spheres and\npresumably known to Congress, of ignoring artifice when\nidentifying the parties to a transaction. In United States\nv. One 1936 Model Ford V-8 Deluxe Coach, Commercial\nCredit Co., 307 U. S. 219 (1939), for example, we consid-\nered the operation of a statute requiring forfeiture of any\ninterest in property that was used to violate prohibition\nlaws, except if acquired in good faith. There, a straw\npurchaser had bought a car in his name but with his\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbrother’s money, and transferred it to the brother—a\nknown bootlegger—right after driving it off the lot. See\nid., at 222–223. The Court held the finance company’s lien\non the car non-forfeitable because the company had no\nhint that the straw was a straw—that his brother would\nin fact be the owner. See id., at 224. But had the com-\npany known, the Court made clear, a different result would\nhave obtained: The company could not have relied on the\nformalities of the sale to the “ ‘straw’ purchaser” when it\nknew that the “real owner and purchaser” of the car was\nsomeone different. Id., at 223–224. We have similarly\nemphasized the need in other contexts, involving both\ncriminal and civil penalties, to look through a transac-\ntion’s nominal parties to its true participants. See, e.g.,\nAmerican Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 560\nU. S. 183, 193 (2010) (focusing on “substance rather than\nform” in assessing when entities are distinct enough to be\ncapable of conspiring to violate the antitrust laws); Gregory\nv. Helvering, 293 U. S. 465, 470 (1935) (disregarding an\nintermediary shell corporation created to avoid taxes\nbecause doing otherwise would “exalt artifice above reality”).\nWe do no more than that here in holding, consistent\nwith §922’s text, structure, and purpose, that using a\nstraw does not enable evasion of the firearms law.\n   Abramski, along with the dissent, objects that such\naction is no circumvention—that Congress made an inten-\ntional choice, born of “political compromise,” to limit the\ngun law’s compass to the person at the counter, even if\nmerely acting on another’s behalf. Reply Brief 11; post, at\n10–11. As evidence, Abramski states that the statute does\nnot regulate beyond the initial point of sale. Because the\nlaw mostly addresses sales made by licensed dealers, a\npurchaser can (within wide limits) subsequently decide to\nresell his gun to another private party. See Reply Brief\n11. And similarly, Abramski says, a purchaser can buy a\ngun for someone else as a gift. See Brief for Petitioner 26–\n16                ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n27, n. 3. Abramski lumps in the same category the trans-\nfer of a gun from a nominal to a real buyer—as something,\nlike a later resale or gift, meant to fall outside the stat-\nute’s     (purported)    standing-in-front-of-the-gun-dealer\nscope. See Reply Brief 13; see also post, at 7–9.\n   But Abramski and the dissent draw the wrong conclu-\nsion from their observations about resales and gifts. Yes,\nCongress decided to regulate dealers’ sales, while leaving\nthe secondary market for guns largely untouched. As we\nnoted in Huddleston, Congress chose to make the dealer\nthe “principal agent of federal enforcement” in “restricting\n[criminals’] access to firearms.” 415 U. S., at 824. And\nyes, that choice (like pretty much everything Congress\ndoes) was surely a result of compromise. But no, straw\narrangements are not a part of the secondary market,\nseparate and apart from the dealer’s sale. In claiming as\nmuch, Abramski merely repeats his mistaken assumption\nthat the “person” who acquires a gun from a dealer in a\ncase like this one is the straw, rather than the individual\nwho has made a prior arrangement to pay for, take pos-\nsession of, own, and use that part of the dealer’s stock.\nFor all the reasons we have already given, that is not a\nplausible construction of a statute mandating that the\ndealer identify and run a background check on the person\nto whom it is (really, not fictitiously) selling a gun. See\nsupra, at 9–15. The individual who sends a straw to a gun\nstore to buy a firearm is transacting with the dealer, in\nevery way but the most formal; and that distinguishes\nsuch a person from one who buys a gun, or receives a gun\nas a gift, from a private party.9 The line Congress drew\n——————\n  9 The dissent responds: “That certainly distinguishes” the individual\n\ntransacting with a dealer through a straw from an individual receiving\na gun from a private party; “so would the fact that [the former] has\norange hair.” Post, at 9. But that is an example of wit gone wrong.\nWhether the purchaser has orange hair, we can all agree, is immaterial\nto the statutory scheme. By contrast, whether the purchaser has\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween those who acquire guns from dealers and those\nwho get them as gifts or on the secondary market, we\nsuspect, reflects a host of things, including administrative\nsimplicity and a view about where the most problematic\nfirearm transactions—like criminal organizations’ bulk\ngun purchases—typically occur. But whatever the reason,\nthe scarcity of controls in the secondary market provides\nno reason to gut the robust measures Congress enacted at\nthe point of sale.\n   Abramski claims further support for his argument from\nCongress’s decision in 1986 to amend §922(d) to prohibit a\nprivate party (and not just, as originally enacted, a li-\ncensed dealer) from selling a gun to someone he knows or\nreasonably should know cannot legally possess one. See\nFirearm Owners’ Protection Act, §102(5)(A), 100 Stat.\n451–452. According to Abramski, the revised §922(d)\nshould be understood as Congress’s exclusive response to\nthe potential dangers arising from straw purchases. See\nBrief for Petitioner 26–27. The amendment shows, he\nclaims, that “Congress chose to address this perceived\nproblem in a way other than” by imposing liability under\n§922(a)(6) on a straw who tells a licensed dealer that he is\nthe firearm’s actual buyer. Reply Brief 14, n. 2.\n   But Congress’s amendment of §922(d) says nothing\nabout §922(a)(6)’s application to straw purchasers. In en-\nacting that amendment, Congress left §922(a)(6) just as\nit was, undercutting any suggestion that Congress some-\n——————\ntransacted with a licensed dealer is integral to the statute—because, as\npreviously noted, “the federal scheme . . . controls access to weapons”\nthrough the federally licensed firearms dealer, who is “the principal\nagent of federal enforcement.” Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S.\n814, 824, 825 (1974); see supra, at 16. In so designing the statute,\nCongress chose not to pursue the goal of “controll[ing] access” to guns to\nthe nth degree; buyers can, as the dissent says, avoid the statute’s\nbackground check and record-keeping requirements by getting a gun\nsecond-hand. But that possibility provides no justification for limiting\nthe statute’s considered regulation of dealer sales.\n18                ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhow intended to contract that provision’s reach. The\namendment instead performed a different function: Rather\nthan ensuring that a licensed dealer receives truthful\ninformation, it extended a minimal form of regulation to\nthe secondary market. The revised §922(d) prevents a\nprivate person from knowingly selling a gun to an ineligi-\nble owner no matter when or how he acquired the weapon:\nIt thus applies not just to a straw purchaser, but to an\nindividual who bought a gun for himself and later decided\nto resell it. At the same time, §922(d) has nothing to say\nabout a raft of cases §922(a)(6) covers, including all the\n(many) straw purchases in which the frontman does not\nknow that the actual buyer is ineligible. See supra, at 13.\nThus, §922(d) could not serve as an effective substitute for\n§922(a)(6). And the mere potential for some transactions\nto run afoul of both prohibitions gives no cause to read\n§922(d) as limiting §922(a)(6) (or vice versa). See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Batchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 118–126\n(1979).10\n  Abramski’s principal attack on his §922(a)(6) conviction\ntherefore fails. Contrary to his contention, the infor-\nmation Question 11.a. requests—“[a]re you the actual\ntransferee/buyer[?]” or, put conversely, “are [you] acquir-\n——————\n  10 Nor do we agree with the dissent’s argument (not urged by\n\nAbramski himself) that the rule of lenity defeats our construction. See\npost, at 12–14. That rule, as we have repeatedly emphasized, applies\nonly if, “after considering text, structure, history and purpose, there\nremains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that\nthe Court must simply guess as to what Congress intended.” Maracich\nv. Spears, 570 U.

We are not in that position here:\nAlthough the text creates some ambiguity, the context, structure,\nhistory, and purpose resolve it. The dissent would apply the rule of\nlenity here because the statute’s text, taken alone, permits a narrower\nconstruction, but we have repeatedly emphasized that is not the appro-\npriate test. See, e.g., Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 138\n(1998); Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 239 (1993).\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

That is because,\nfor all the reasons we have given, the firearms law con-\ntemplates that the dealer will check not the fictitious\npurchaser’s but instead the true purchaser’s identity and\neligibility for gun ownership. By concealing that Alvarez\nwas the actual buyer, Abramski prevented the dealer from\ntransacting with Alvarez face-to-face, see §922(c), record-\ning his name, age, and residence, see §922(b)(5), inspect-\ning his photo ID, see §922(t)(1)(C), submitting his identify-\ning information to the background check system, see\n§922(t)(1)(B), and determining whether he was prohibited\nfrom receiving a firearm, see §922(d). In sum, Abramski\nthwarted application of essentially all of the firearms law’s\nrequirements. We can hardly think of a misrepresentation\nany more material to a sale’s legality.\n                              III\n  Abramski also challenges his §922(a)(6) conviction on a\nnarrower ground. For purposes of this argument, he\nassumes that the Government can make its case when a\nstraw hides the name of an underlying purchaser who is\nlegally ineligible to own a gun. But, Abramski reminds us,\nthat is not true here, because Alvarez could have bought a\ngun for himself. In such circumstances, Abramski claims\nthat a false response to Question 11.a. is not material. See\nBrief for Petitioner 28–30. Essentially, Abramski con-\ntends, when the hidden purchaser is eligible anyway to\nown a gun, all’s well that ends well, and all should be\nforgiven.\n  But we think what we have already said shows the\nfallacy of that claim: Abramski’s false statement was\nmaterial because had he revealed that he was purchasing\nthe gun on Alvarez’s behalf, the sale could not have pro-\nceeded under the law—even though Alvarez turned out to\nbe an eligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter,\n20              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould not have complied with §922(c)’s restrictions on\nabsentee purchases. See supra, at 11–12. If the dealer\nhere, Town Police Supply, had realized it was in fact\nselling a gun to Alvarez, it would have had to stop the\ntransaction for failure to comply with those conditions.\nYet more, the sale could not have gone forward because\nthe dealer would have lacked the information needed to\nverify and record Alvarez’s identity and check his back-\nground. See §§922(b)(5), (t)(1)(B)–(C); supra, at 10–12.\nThose requirements, as we have explained, pertain to the\nreal buyer; and the after-the-fact discovery that Alvarez\nwould have passed the background check cannot somehow\nwipe them away. Accordingly, had Town Police Supply\nknown Abramski was a straw, it could not have certified,\nas Form 4473 demands, its belief that the transfer was\n“not unlawful.” Supp. App. 3.\n  An analogy may help show the weakness of Abramski’s\nargument. Suppose a would-be purchaser, Smith, lawfully\ncould own a gun. But further suppose that, for reasons of\nhis own, Smith uses an alias (let’s say Jones) to make the\npurchase. Would anyone say “no harm, no foul,” just\nbecause Smith is not in fact a prohibited person under\n§922(d)? We think not. Smith would in any event have\nmade a false statement about who will own the gun, im-\npeding the dealer’s ability to carry out its legal responsi-\nbilities. So too here.\n  Abramski objects that because Alvarez could own a gun,\nthe statute’s core purpose—“keeping guns out of the\nhands” of criminals and other prohibited persons—“is not\neven implicated.” Brief for Petitioner 29. But that argu-\nment (which would apply no less to the alias scenario)\nmisunderstands the way the statute works. As earlier\nnoted, the federal gun law makes the dealer “[t]he princi-\npal agent of federal enforcement.” Huddleston, 415 U. S.,\nat 824, see supra, at 16. It is that highly regulated, legally\nknowledgeable entity, possessing access to the expansive\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNICS database, which has the responsibility to “[e]nsure\nthat, in the course of sales or other dispositions . . . ,\nweapons [are not] obtained by individuals whose posses-\nsion of them would be contrary to the public interest.” 415\nU. S., at 825. Nothing could be less consonant with the\nstatutory scheme than placing that inquiry in the hands of\nan unlicensed straw purchaser, who is unlikely to be\nfamiliar with federal firearms law and has no ability to\nuse the database to check whether the true buyer may\nown a gun. And in any event, keeping firearms out of the\nhands of criminals is not §922’s only goal: The statute’s\nrecord-keeping provisions, as we have said, are also de-\nsigned to aid law enforcement in the investigation of\ncrime. See supra, at 2–3, 12–13. Abramski’s proposed\nlimitation on §922(a)(6) would undercut that purpose\nbecause many would-be criminals remain legally eligible\nto buy firearms, and thus could use straws to purchase an\nendless stream of guns off-the-books. See, e.g., Polk, 118\nF. 3d, at 289 (eligible gun buyer used straw purchasers to\nsecretly accumulate an “arsenal of weapons” for a “mas-\nsive offensive” against the Federal Government).\n   In addition, Abramski briefly notes that until 1995, the\nATF took the view that a straw purchaser’s misrepresen-\ntation counted as material only if the true buyer could not\nlegally possess a gun. See Brief for Petitioner 7–8; n. 8,\nsupra. We may put aside that ATF has for almost two\ndecades now taken the opposite position, after reflecting\non both appellate case law and changes in the statute. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 41; Brady Handgun Violence Prevention\nAct of 1993, §103, 107 Stat. 1541 (codified at 18 U. S. C.\n§922(t)). The critical point is that criminal laws are for\ncourts, not for the Government, to construe. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Apel, 571 U. S. ___, (2014) (slip op., at 9)\n(“[W]e have never held that the Government’s reading of a\ncriminal statute is entitled to any deference”). We think\nATF’s old position no more relevant than its current one—\n22              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich is to say, not relevant at all. Whether the Govern-\nment interprets a criminal statute too broadly (as it some-\ntimes does) or too narrowly (as the ATF used to in constru-\ning §922(a)(6)), a court has an obligation to correct its\nerror. Here, nothing suggests that Congress—the entity\nwhose voice does matter—limited its prohibition of a\nstraw purchaser’s misrepresentation in the way Abramski\nproposes.\n                              IV\n  Finally, Abramski challenges his conviction under\n§924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits “knowingly mak[ing] any\nfalse statement . . . with respect to the information re-\nquired by this chapter to be kept in the records” of a feder-\nally licensed dealer. That provision is broader than\n§922(a)(6) in one respect: It does not require that the false\nstatement at issue be “material” in any way. At the same\ntime, §924(a)(1)(A) includes an element absent from\n§922(a)(6): The false statement must relate to “infor-\nmation required by this chapter to be kept in [a dealer’s]\nrecords.” Abramski notes that the indictment in this case\ncharged him with only one misrepresentation: his state-\nment in response to Question 11.a. that he was buying the\nGlock on his own behalf rather than on someone else’s.\nAnd, he argues, that information (unlike the transferee’s\n“name, age, and place of residence,” which he plausibly\nreads the indictment as not mentioning) was not required\n“by this chapter”—but only by Form 4473 itself—to be kept\nin the dealer’s permanent records. Brief for Petitioner 32.\n  We disagree. Included in “this chapter”—Chapter 44 of\nTitle 18—is a provision, noted earlier, requiring a dealer\nto “maintain such records of . . . sale, or other disposition\nof firearms at his place of business for such period, and in\nsuch form, as the Attorney General may by regulations\nprescribe.” §923(g)(1)(A); supra, at 3. Because of that\nstatutory section, the information that the Attorney Gen-\neral’s regulations compel a dealer to keep is information\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n“required by this chapter.” And those regulations (the\nvalidity of which Abramski does not here contest) demand\nthat every licensed dealer “retain . . . as a part of [its]\nrequired records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course\nof ” selling or otherwise disposing of a firearm. 27 CFR\n§478.124(b). Accordingly, a false answer on that form,\nsuch as the one Abramski made, pertains to information a\ndealer is statutorily required to maintain.11\n                              V\n   No piece of information is more important under federal\nfirearms law than the identity of a gun’s purchaser—the\nperson who acquires a gun as a result of a transaction\nwith a licensed dealer. Had Abramski admitted that he\nwas not that purchaser, but merely a straw—that he was\nasking the dealer to verify the identity of, and run a back-\nground check on, the wrong individual—the sale here\ncould not have gone forward. That makes Abramski’s\nmisrepresentation on Question 11.a. material under\n§922(a)(6). And because that statement pertained to\ninformation that a dealer must keep in its permanent\nrecords under the firearms law, Abramski’s answer to\nQuestion 11.a. also violated §924(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, we\naffirm the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\n——————\n  11 The dissent argues that our view would impose criminal liability for\n\na false answer even to an “ultra vires question,” such as “the buyer’s\nfavorite color.” Post, at 15. We need not, and do not, opine on that\nhypothetical, because it is miles away from this case. As we have\nexplained, see supra at 9–19, Question 11.a. is not ultra vires, but\ninstead fundamental to the lawfulness of a gun sale. It is, indeed, part\nand parcel of the dealer’s determination of the (true) buyer’s “name,\nage, and place of residence,” which §922(b)(5) requires the dealer to\nkeep. That section alone would justify Abramski’s conviction under\n§924(a)(1)(A) if the indictment here had clearly alleged that, in addition\nto answering Question 11.a. falsely, he lied about that buyer’s “name,\nage, and place of residence.”\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Both men were legally eligible to receive\nand possess firearms, and Abramski transferred the gun\nto his uncle at a federally licensed gun dealership in com-\npliance with state law. When buying the gun, Abramski\nhad to fill out Form 4473 issued by the Bureau of Alcohol,\nTobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). In response to a\nquestion on the form, Abramski affirmed that he was the\n“actual/transferee buyer” of the gun, even though the form\nstated that he was not the “actual transferee/buyer” if he\nwas purchasing the gun for a third party at that person’s\nrequest and with funds provided by that person.\n  The Government charged Abramski with two federal\ncrimes under the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended, 18\nU. S. C. §§921–931: making a false statement “material to\nthe lawfulness of the sale,” in violation of §922(a)(6), and\nmaking a false statement “with respect to information\nrequired by [the Act] to be kept” by the dealer, in violation\nof §924(a)(1)(A). On both counts the Government inter-\nprets this criminal statute to punish conduct that its plain\nlanguage simply does not reach. I respectfully dissent\nfrom the Court’s holding to the contrary.\n2               ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n                      I. Section 922(a)(6)\n                               A\n   Under §922(a)(6), it is a crime to make a “false . . .\nstatement” to a licensed gun dealer about a “fact material\nto the lawfulness of ” a firearms sale. Abramski made a\nfalse statement when he claimed to be the gun’s “actual\ntransferee/buyer” as Form 4473 defined that term. But\nthat false statement was not “material to the lawfulness of\nthe sale” since the truth—that Abramski was buying the\ngun for his uncle with his uncle’s money—would not have\nmade the sale unlawful. See Kungys v. United States, 485\nU. S. 759, 775 (1988) (plurality opinion) (materiality is\ndetermined by asking “what would have ensued from\nofficial knowledge of the misrepresented fact”); accord id.,\nat 787 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Therefore,\nAbramski’s conviction on this count cannot stand.\n   Several provisions of the Act limit the circumstances in\nwhich a licensed gun dealer may lawfully sell a firearm.\nMost prominently, the Act provides that no one may “sell\nor otherwise dispose of ” a firearm to a person who he\nknows or has reasonable cause to believe falls within one\nof nine prohibited categories (such as felons, fugitives,\nillegal-drug users, and the mentally ill). §922(d). But the\nGovernment does not contend that either Abramski or his\nuncle fell into one of those prohibited categories. And no\nprovision of the Act prohibits one person who is eligible to\nreceive and possess firearms (e.g., Abramski) from buying\na gun for another person who is eligible to receive and\npossess firearms (e.g., Abramski’s uncle), even at the\nother’s request and with the other’s money.\n   The Government’s contention that Abramski’s false\nstatement was material to the lawfulness of the sale de-\npends on a strained interpretation of provisions that\nmention the “person” to whom a dealer “sell[s]” (or “trans-\nfer[s],” or “deliver[s]”) a gun. A dealer may not “sell or\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

He may not, without following special proce-\ndures, “sell” a firearm to a “person” who does not appear in\nperson at the dealer’s business. §922(c). He may not\n“transfer” a firearm to a “person” without verifying that\nperson’s identity and running a background check.\n§922(t)(1). And he may not “sell or deliver” a firearm to a\n“person” who he knows or has reasonable cause to believe\nresides in a different State. §922(b)(3).\n   The Government maintains that in this case Abramski’s\nuncle was the “person” to whom the dealer “s[old]” the\ngun, and that the sale consequently violated those provi-\nsions. It bases that assertion on the claim that the Gun\nControl Act implicitly incorporates “principles of agency\nlaw.” Brief for United States 17. Under those principles,\nit contends, the individual who walks into a dealer’s store,\nfills out the requisite forms, pays the dealer, and takes\npossession of the gun is not necessarily the “person” to\nwhom the dealer “sell[s]” the gun. Instead, it says, we\nmust ask whether that individual bought the gun as a\nthird party’s common-law agent; if so, then the third party\nis the “person” to whom the dealer “sell[s]” the gun within\nthe meaning of the relevant statutory provisions. The\nmajority agrees: Although it never explicitly mentions\nagency law, it declares that if an individual is “buying a\nfirearm on someone else’s behalf,” the “someone else” is\nthe “person” to whom the dealer “sell[s]” the gun within\nthe meaning of the statute. Ante, at 9.\n   I doubt that three of the four provisions at issue here\nwould establish the materiality of Abramski’s falsehood\neven if Abramski’s uncle were deemed the “person” to\nwhom the dealer “s[old]” the gun.1 But §922(b)(3) would\n——————\n  1 Sections 922(b)(5), (c), and (t)(1) require the dealer to follow certain\n\nprocedures with respect to that “person,” such as recording his name,\n4                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nunquestionably do so, since it prohibits a dealer from\nselling a gun to a person who resides in another State, as\nAbramski’s uncle did. That is of no moment, however,\nbecause Abramski’s uncle was not the “person” to whom\nthe gun was “s[old].”\n   The contrary interpretation provided by the Govern-\nment and the majority founders on the plain language of\nthe Act. We interpret criminal statutes, like other stat-\nutes, in a manner consistent with ordinary English usage.\nFlores-Figueroa v. United States, 556 U. S. 646, 650–652\n(2009); Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848, 855 (2000);\nBailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144–145 (1995). In\nordinary usage, a vendor sells (or delivers, or transfers) an\nitem of merchandise to the person who physically appears\nin his store, selects the item, pays for it, and takes posses-\nsion of it. So if I give my son $10 and tell him to pick up\nmilk and eggs at the store, no English speaker would say\nthat the store “sells” the milk and eggs to me.2 And even if\nwe were prepared to let “principles of agency law” trump\nordinary English usage in the interpretation of this crimi-\nnal statute, those principles would not require a different\n——————\ndealing with him in person, and checking his background. I doubt\nwhether a falsehood that causes the dealer to neglect those procedures\n(here, by applying them to the wrong person) is material to the lawful-\nness of the sale within the meaning of §922(a)(6) if the sale could have\nbeen executed lawfully had the truth been disclosed. Moreover, if that\nwere so—if a falsehood that introduced procedural error into a gun sale\nwere always material to lawfulness—then §924(a)(1)(A) (discussed in\nPart II of this opinion), which prohibits making false statements with\nrespect to information required to be recorded in a dealer’s records,\nwould be superfluous.\n  2 The majority makes the puzzling suggestion that the answer would\n\nbe different if the sale involved consumer electronics instead of grocer-\nies. Ante, at 9, n. 5. But whether the item sold is a carton of milk, an\niPhone, or anything else under the sun, an ordinary English speaker\nwould say that an over-the-counter merchant “sells” the item to the\nperson who pays for and takes possession of it, not the individual to\nwhom that person later transfers the item.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Agency §366,\nIllustration 1 (1957) (“On behalf of P, his disclosed princi-\npal, A makes a written contract with T wherein A prom-\nises to buy from T, and T agrees to sell to A, certain machin-\nery for $1000. . . . [If there is fraud in the inducement and\nA has already paid], A can maintain an action against T\nfor the thousand dollars” (emphasis added)).\n    Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814 (1974), on\nwhich the majority relies, ante, at 14, does not suggest\notherwise. There we addressed the types of transactions\ncovered by the statutory term “acquisition” in §922(a)(6) (a\nterm whose meaning is not at issue here), holding that\nthey were not limited to “sale-like transaction[s]” but\nincluded a “pawnshop redemption of a firearm.” 415 U. S.,\nat 819. We said nothing about the distinct question of to\nwhom a dealer “sell[s],” “transfer[s],” or “deliver[s]” a\nfirearm in a given transaction. Nor does the case stand, as\nthe majority believes, for “a substance-over-form ap-\nproach,” ante, at 14. We said the term “acquisition” was\n“ ‘aimed at providing maximum coverage,’ ” ibid. (quoting\n415 U. S., at 826–827), not because substance over form\ndemands that, nor because everything in the Act must be\nassumed to provide maximum coverage, but because “[t]he\nword ‘acquire’ is defined to mean simply ‘to come into\npossession, control, or power of disposal of,’ ” which gives\n“no intimation . . . that title or ownership would be neces-\nsary.” Id., at 820.\n    Contrary to the majority’s assertion that the statute\n“merely raises, rather than answers, the critical question”\nof whether Abramski or his uncle was the “person” to\nwhom the dealer “s[old]” the gun, ante, at 9, the statute\nspeaks to that question directly. Giving the text its plain,\nordinary meaning, Abramski, not his uncle, was that\n“person.” That being so, the Government has identified no\nreason why the arrangement between Abramski and his\nuncle, both of whom were eligible to receive and possess\n6                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfirearms, was “material to the lawfulness of ” the sale.3\n                             B\n   The majority contends, however, that the Gun Control\nAct’s “principal purpose” of “curb[ing] crime by keeping\nfirearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to\npossess them” demands the conclusion that Abramski’s\nuncle was the “person” to whom the dealer “s[old]” the\ngun. Ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). But\n“no law pursues its purpose at all costs,” and the “textual\nlimitations upon a law’s scope” are equally “a part of its\n‘purpose.’ ” Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 752\n(2006) (plurality opinion). The majority’s purpose-based\narguments describe a statute Congress reasonably might\nhave written, but not the statute it wrote.\n   The heart of the majority’s argument is its claim that\nunless Abramski’s uncle is deemed the “person” to whom\nthe gun was “s[old],” the Act’s identification, background-\ncheck, and record-keeping requirements would be “ren-\nder[ed] meaningless.” Ante, at 11. That vastly overstates\nthe consequences. Perhaps the statute would serve the\npurpose of crime prevention more effectively if the re-\nquirements at issue looked past the “man at the counter”\nto the person “getting, and always meant to get, the fire-\n\n——————\n  3 The facts of this case provide no occasion to address whether—as\n\nATF maintained for many years before adopting its current position—a\nmisrepresentation in response to Form 4473’s “actual buyer/transferee”\nquestion would be “material to the lawfulness of the sale” if the cus-\ntomer intended to transfer the gun to a person who he knew or had\nreasonable cause to believe was prohibited by the Act from receiving or\npossessing firearms. A falsehood that conceals an intention of that sort\nmay be material because a dealer who sold the gun knowing of that\nintention might be “unlawfully aiding” the customer’s violation of\n§924(d) (and the prohibited person’s violation of §924(g)). Cf. ATF,\nIndustry Circular 79–10 (1979), in (Your Guide To) Federal Firearms\nRegulation 1988–89 (1988), p. 78; infra, at 10–11.

But ensuring that the person taking\npossession of the firearm from the dealer is eligible to\nreceive and possess a firearm, and recording information\nabout that person for later reference, are by no means\nworthless functions. On the contrary, they indisputably\nadvance the purpose of crime prevention by making it\nharder for ineligible persons to acquire guns and easier for\nthe Government to locate those guns in the future; they\nsimply do not advance that purpose to the same degree as\na more exacting law might have done.\n   That the Act’s focus on the “man at the counter” in this\nsituation does not render its requirements “meaningless”\nis confirmed by the Government’s concession that the Act\nhas a similar focus in many comparable situations where\nthe gun’s immediate purchaser is—to use the majority’s\nphrase—a “mere condui[t]” for a contemplated transfer of\nthe gun to a different person who will “take possession of,\nown, and use” it. Ante, at 11, 16. Consider the following\nscenarios in which even the Government regards the man\nat the counter as the “person” to whom the dealer “sell[s]”\nthe gun:\n\n   \t Guns Intended as Gifts. In the Government’s view,\n      an individual who buys a gun “with the intent of\n      making a gift of the firearm to another person” is\n      the gun’s “true purchaser.” ATF, Federal Firearms\n      Regulations Reference Guide 165 (2005) (hereinaf-\n      ter 2005 ATF Guide). The Government’s position\n      makes no exception for situations where the gift is\n      specifically requested by the recipient (as gifts\n      sometimes are). So long as no money changes\n      hands, and no agency relationship is formed, be-\n      tween gifter and giftee, the Act is concerned only\n      with the man at the counter.\n\n   \t Guns Intended for Resale. Introducing money into\n8               ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n       the equation does not automatically change the\n       outcome. The Government admits that the man at\n       the counter is the true purchaser even if he imme-\n       diately sells the gun to someone else. Tr. of Oral\n       Arg. 34–35. And it appears the Government’s posi-\n       tion would be the same even if the man at the\n       counter purchased the gun with the intent to sell it\n       to a particular third party, so long as the two did\n       not enter into a common-law agency relationship.\n\n    \t Guns Intended as Raffle Prizes. The Government\n       considers the man at the counter the true pur-\n       chaser even if he is buying the gun “for the purpose\n       of raffling [it] at an event”—in which case he can\n       provide his own information on Form 4473 and\n       “transfer the firearm to the raffle winner without a\n       Form 4473 being completed or a [background]\n       check being conducted” on the winner. 2005 ATF\n       Guide 195.\n\nIf the statute’s requirements were “render[ed] meaning-\nless” by treating Abramski rather than his uncle as the\ntrue purchaser, then they would be every bit as meaning-\nless in the scenarios just described. The Government’s\nconcession that the statute is operating appropriately in\neach of those scenarios should cause the majority to\nreevaluate its assumptions about the type and degree of\nregulation that the statute regards as “meaningful.” The\nmajority, it is clear, regards Abramski’s interpretation as\ncreating a loophole in the law; but even if that were a fair\ncharacterization, why is the majority convinced that a\nstatute with so many admitted loopholes does not contain\nthis particular loophole?\n   The majority’s answer to this argument is that “the\nindividual who sends a straw to a gun store to buy a fire-\narm is transacting with the dealer, in every way but the\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

That cer-\ntainly distinguishes that individual from the intended\nsubsequent donee or purchaser; so would the fact that he\nhas orange hair. But it does not establish why that indi-\nvidual, any more than the others, should be thought to be\ncovered by statutory language (the “person” to whom\na dealer “sell[s]” a gun) that does not naturally apply.\nThe only thing which can justify that leap is the false\nimperative to make the statute as effective as possible,\nrather than as effective as the language indicates Con-\ngress desired.4\n  What the scenarios described above show is that the\nstatute typically is concerned only with the man at the\ncounter, even where that man is in a practical sense a\n“conduit” who will promptly transfer the gun to someone\nelse. Perhaps that is because Congress wanted a rule that\nwould be easy to understand and to administer, which the\nGovernment’s proposed agency test—and the majority’s\napparent adoption of that test sans any mention of agency\nlaw—certainly is not. (When counsel for the Government\nwas pressed about hypothetical situations not gift-\nwrapped as neatly as this case, he said, frankly but un-\nhelpfully, that they would turn on the “factual question” of\n“[w]hether the purchase was made on behalf of someone\n——————\n  4 The majority’s claim that its analysis “does not rest on mere ‘purpose-\n\nbased arguments,’ ” ante, at 9, n. 6, rings hollow. The majority\nsays it is relying on the principle that when a statutory provision is\n“ambiguous” but “only one of the permissible meanings produces a\nsubstantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law,” we\nshould adopt that meaning. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBut even if the text at issue here were ambiguous, it is clear that the\n“substantive effect” of the narrower interpretation is “compatible\nwith”—indeed, it is downright congenial to—“the rest of ” the Gun\nControl Act. The majority’s contrary conclusion rests, not on anything\nin the text or structure of the Act, but on the majority’s guess about\nhow far Congress meant to go in pursuit of its crime-prevention\n“purpose.”\n10              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nelse.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 49–50.)\n   Or perhaps Congress drew the line where it did because\nthe Gun Control Act, like many contentious pieces of\nlegislation, was a “compromise” among “highly interested\nparties attempting to pull the provisions in different direc-\ntions.” Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 461\n(2002); see Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation\nPrograms v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co.,\n514 U. S. 122, 135–136 (1995). Perhaps those whose votes\nwere needed for passage of the statute wanted a lawful\npurchaser to be able to use an agent. A statute shaped by\npolitical tradeoffs in a controversial area may appear\n“imperfect” from some perspectives, but “our ability to\nimagine ways of redesigning the statute to advance one of\nCongress’ ends does not render it irrational.” Preseault v.\nICC, 494 U. S. 1, 19 (1990). We must accept that Con-\ngress, balancing the conflicting demands of a divided\ncitizenry, “ ‘wrote the statute it wrote’—meaning, a statute\ngoing so far and no further.” Michigan v. Bay Mills In-\ndian Community, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 11).\n   That Abramski’s reading does not render the Act’s\nrequirements “meaningless” is further evidenced by the\nfact that, for decades, even ATF itself did not read the\nstatute to criminalize conduct like Abramski’s. After\nCongress passed the Act in 1968, ATF’s initial position\nwas that the Act did not prohibit the sale of a gun to an\neligible buyer acting on behalf of a third party (even an\nineligible one). See Hearings Before the Subcommittee To\nInvestigate Juvenile Delinquency of the Senate Committee\non the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, 118 (1975).\nA few years later, ATF modified its position and asserted\nthat the Act did not “prohibit a dealer from making a sale\nto a person who is actually purchasing the firearm for\nanother person” unless the other person was “prohibited\nfrom receiving or possessing a firearm,” in which case the\ndealer could be guilty of “unlawfully aiding the prohibited\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nperson’s own violation.” ATF, Industry Circular 79–10\n(1979), in (Your Guide To) Federal Firearms Regulation\n1988–89 (1988), p. 78. The agency appears not to have\nadopted its current position until the early 1990’s. See\nUnited States v. Polk, 118 F. 3d 286, 295, n. 7 (CA5 1997).\n   The majority deems this enforcement history “not rel-\nevant” because the Government’s reading of a criminal\nstatute is not entitled to deference. Ante, at 22. But the\nfact that the agency charged with enforcing the Act read\nit, over a period of roughly 25 years, not to apply to the\ntype of conduct at issue here is powerful evidence that\ninterpreting the Act in that way is natural and reasonable\nand does not make its requirements “meaningless.”\n                              C\n    Even if the statute were wrongly thought to be ambigu-\nous on this point, the rule of lenity would defeat the Gov-\nernment’s construction. It is a “familiar principle” that\n“ ‘ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes\nshould be resolved in favor of lenity.’ ” Skilling v. United\nStates, 561 U. S. 358, 410 (2010). That principle prevents\nus from giving the words of a criminal statute “a meaning\nthat is different from [their] ordinary, accepted meaning,\nand that disfavors the defendant.” Burrage v. United\nStates, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12). And it\nmeans that when a criminal statute has two possible\nreadings, we do not “ ‘choose the harsher alternative’ ”\nunless Congress has “ ‘spoken in language that is clear and\ndefinite.’ ” United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347–349\n(1971). For the reasons given above, it cannot be said that\nthe statute unambiguously commands the Government’s\ncurrent reading. It is especially contrary to sound practice\nto give this criminal statute a meaning that the Govern-\nment itself rejected for years.\n    The majority does not mention the rule of lenity apart\nfrom a footnote, ante, at 18, n. 10, responding to this dis-\n12                 ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsent. The footnote concedes that “the text creates some\nambiguity” but says that “context, structure, history, and\npurpose resolve it.” Ibid. But for the reasons given above,\ncontext and structure do not support the majority’s inter-\npretation, history refutes it by showing that the Govern-\nment itself interpreted the statute more leniently for\nmany years, and “purpose” supports it only if one imputes\nto the statute a crime-fighting purpose broader than the\ntext discloses (a practice that would nullify the rule of\nlenity in all cases). See Part I–B, supra.5 If lenity has no\nrole to play in a clear case such as this one, we ought to\nstop pretending it is a genuine part of our jurisprudence.\n  Contrary to the majority’s miserly approach, the rule of\nlenity applies whenever, after all legitimate tools of inter-\npretation have been exhausted, “a reasonable doubt per-\nsists” regarding whether Congress has made the defend-\nant’s conduct a federal crime, Moskal v. United States, 498\nU. S. 103, 108 (1990)—in other words, whenever those\ntools do not decisively dispel the statute’s ambiguity.\nSkilling, supra, at 410; see, e.g., Scheidler v. National\nOrganization for Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 393, 409 (2003);\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000); Cran-\ndon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 158 (1990). “[W]here\ntext, structure, and history fail to establish that the Gov-\nernment’s position is unambiguously correct . . . we apply\nthe rule of lenity and resolve the ambiguity in [the de-\nfendant]’s favor.” United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S.\n39, 54 (1994). It cannot honestly be said that the text,\nstructure, and history of the Gun Control Act establish as\n“unambiguously correct” that the Act makes Abramski’s\nconduct a federal crime.\n  By refusing to apply lenity here, the majority turns its\n——————\n  5 The majority is thus entirely wrong to charge that I would apply the\n\nrule of lenity “because the statute’s text, taken alone, permits a nar-\nrower construction,” ante, at 18, n. 10.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

J.); see, e.g., 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\non the Laws of England 88 (1765) (“Penal statutes must be\nconstrued strictly”). As Chief Justice Marshall wrote, the\nrule is “founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights\nof individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of\npunishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial\ndepartment.” Wiltberger, supra, at 95. It forbids a court\nto criminalize an act simply because the court deems that\nact “of equal atrocity, or of kindred character, with those\nwhich are enumerated.” Id., at 96. Today’s majority\ndisregards that foundational principle.\n                   II. Section 924(a)(1)(A)\n   Under §924(a)(1)(A), it is a crime to make a “false\nstatement . . . with respect to the information required by\nthis chapter to be kept in the records of ” a federally li-\ncensed gun dealer (emphasis added). “[T]his chapter”\nrefers to chapter 44 of title 18 of the United States Code,\nwhich contains the Gun Control Act. §§921–931.\n   The question Abramski answered falsely was whether\nhe was buying the gun for someone else. Did the Act itself\nrequire the dealer to record this information? It did not; it\nsimply required him to record “the name, age, and place of\nresidence” of the “person” to whom the firearm was “s[old]\nor deliver[ed].” §922(b)(5). As explained above, that “per-\nson” was Abramski, not his uncle. See Part I, supra.\n   But, the majority says, the Act also directs dealers to\n“ ‘maintain such records . . . as the Attorney General may\nby regulations prescribe.’ ”        Ante, at 22 (quoting\n§923(g)(1)(A)). So did a regulation require this infor-\nmation to be recorded? Again, no. The relevant regulation\nprovides that a dealer shall\n    “obtain a Form 4473 from the transferee showing the\n14               ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n     transferee’s name, sex, residence address (including\n     county or similar political subdivision), date and place\n     of birth; height, weight and race of the transferee; the\n     transferee’s country of citizenship; the transferee’s\n     INS-issued alien number or admission number; the\n     transferee’s State of residence; and certification by the\n     transferee that the transferee is not prohibited by the\n     Act from transporting or shipping a firearm in inter-\n     state or foreign commerce or receiving a firearm\n     which has been shipped or transported in interstate or\n     foreign commerce or possessing a firearm in or affect-\n     ing commerce.” 27 CFR §478.124(c)(1) (2014).\nThe long list of information that this regulation requires\nto be kept in the dealer’s records does not include whether\nthe transferee is buying the gun for an eligible third party.\n   But wait! the majority says: Another provision of the\nregulation requires a dealer to “ ‘retain . . . as part of [its]\nrequired records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course\nof ’ ” selling or disposing of a firearm. Ante, at 23 (quoting\n27 CFR §478.124(a)). Therefore, according to the majority,\nany “false answer on that Form”—even an answer to a\nquestion that is not among those enumerated in the regu-\nlation—necessarily “pertains to information a dealer is\nstatutorily required to maintain.” Ante, at 23.\n   That carries the text of the statute a bridge too far. On\nthe majority’s view, if the bureaucrats responsible for\ncreating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer’s favor-\nite color, a false response would be a federal crime. That\nis not what the statute says. The statute punishes mis-\nstatements “with respect to information required to be\nkept,” §924(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added), not with respect to\n“information contained in forms required to be kept.”\nBecause neither the Act nor any regulation requires a\ndealer to keep a record of whether a customer is purchas-\ning a gun for himself or for an eligible third party, that\n                      Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     15\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nquestion had no place on Form 4473—any more than\nwould the question whether the customer was purchasing\nthe gun as a gift for a particular individual and, if so, who\nthat individual was. And the statute no more criminalizes\na false answer to an ultra vires question on Form 4473\nthan it criminalizes the purchaser’s volunteering of a false\ne-mail address on that form. Information regarding\nAbramski’s status as a “straw purchaser” was not “infor-\nmation required to be kept,” and that is an end of the\nmatter. In my view, that is the best—indeed, the only\nplausible—interpretation of §924(a)(1)(A). But at a mini-\nmum, the statute is ambiguous, and lenity does the rest.\nSee Part I–C, supra.6\n                        *     *    *\n  The Court makes it a federal crime for one lawful gun\nowner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner. Whether\nor not that is a sensible result, the statutes Congress\nenacted do not support it—especially when, as is appro-\npriate, we resolve ambiguity in those statutes in favor of\nthe accused. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  6 The  majority professes that it “need not, and do[es] not, opine on”\nwhether it would impose liability for “a false answer even to an ‘ultra\nvires question’ ” because, given its reasoning on Count One, the ques-\ntion at issue here was “part and parcel of the dealer’s determination of\nthe (true) buyer’s ‘name, age, and place of residence,’ which §922(b)(5)\nrequires the dealer to keep.” Ante, at 23, n. 11. But if that is really all\nthe majority means to decide, then why bother to invoke the require-\nment that the dealer keep such records as the regulations prescribe and\nthe regulation requiring the dealer to keep Form 4473? See ante, at\n22–23. If the majority’s ruling is as limited as it claims, it ought to cite\n§922(b)(5) and be done.\n</pre>", "id": 2678468, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/06/16/abramski_v._united_states.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 22, 2014—Decided June 16, 2014\nPetitioner Bruce Abramski offered to purchase a handgun for his uncle.\n  The form that federal regulations required Abramski to fill out (Form\n  4473) asked whether he was the “actual transferee/buyer” of the gun,\n  and clearly warned that a straw purchaser (namely, someone buying\n  a gun on behalf of another) was not the actual buyer. Abramski\n  falsely answered that he was the actual buyer. Abramski was con-\n  victed for knowingly making false statements “with respect to any\n  fact material to the lawfulness of the sale” of a gun, 18 U. S. C.\n  §922(a)(6), and for making a false statement “with respect to the in-\n  formation required . . . to be kept” in the gun dealer’s records,\n  §924(a)(1)(A). The Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Abramski’s misrepresentation is material under §922(a)(6).\n Pp. 7–22.\n       (a) Abramski contends that federal gun laws are entirely uncon-\n cerned with straw arrangements: So long as the person at the counter\n is eligible to own a gun, the sale to him is legal under the statute. To\n be sure, federal law regulates licensed dealer’s transactions with\n “persons” or “transferees” without specifying whether that language\n refers to the straw buyer or the actual purchaser. But when read in\n light of the statute’s context, structure, and purpose, it is clear this\n language refers to the true buyer rather than the straw. Federal gun\n law establishes an elaborate system of in-person identification and\n background checks to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of\n felons and other prohibited purchasers. §§922(c), 922(t). It also im-\n poses record-keeping requirements to assist law enforcement authori-\n ties in investigating serious crimes through the tracing of guns to\n their buyers. §922(b)(5), 923(g). These provisions would mean little\n2                    ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    if a would-be gun buyer could evade them all simply by enlisting the\n    aid of an intermediary to execute the paperwork on his behalf. The\n    statute’s language is thus best read in context to refer to the actual\n    rather than nominal buyer. This conclusion is reinforced by this\n    Court’s standard practice of focusing on practical realities rather\n    than legal formalities when identifying the parties to a transaction.\n    Pp. 7–19.\n          (b) Abramski argues more narrowly that his false response was\n    not material because his uncle could have legally bought a gun for\n    himself. But Abramski’s false statement prevented the dealer from\n    insisting that the true buyer (Alvarez) appear in person, provide\n    identifying information, show a photo ID, and submit to a back-\n    ground check. §§922(b), (c), (t). Nothing in the statute suggests that\n    these legal duties may be wiped away merely because the actual buy-\n    er turns out to be legally eligible to own a gun. Because the dealer\n    could not have lawfully sold the gun had it known that Abramski was\n    not the true buyer, the misstatement was material to the lawfulness\n    of the sale. Pp. 19–22.\n       2. Abramski’s misrepresentation about the identity of the actual\n    buyer concerned “information required by [Chapter 44 of Title 18 of\n    the United States Code] to be kept” in the dealer’s records.\n    §924(a)(1)(A). Chapter 44 contains a provision requiring a dealer to\n    “maintain such records . . . as the Attorney General may . . . pre-\n    scribe.” §923(g)(1)(A). The Attorney General requires every licensed\n    dealer to retain in its records a completed copy of Form 4473, see 27\n    CFR §478.124(b), and that form in turn includes the “actual buyer”\n    question that Abramski answered falsely. Therefore, falsely answer-\n    ing a question on Form 4473 violates §924(a)(1)(A).

To ensure the accuracy of those sub-\nmissions, a federal statute imposes criminal penalties on\nany person who, in connection with a firearm’s acquisition,\nmakes false statements about “any fact material to the\nlawfulness of the sale.” 18 U. S. C. §922(a)(6). In this\ncase, we consider how that law applies to a so-called straw\npurchaser—namely, a person who buys a gun on someone\nelse’s behalf while falsely claiming that it is for himself.\nWe hold that such a misrepresentation is punishable\nunder the statute, whether or not the true buyer could\nhave purchased the gun without the straw.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Federal law has for over 40 years regulated sales by\nlicensed firearms dealers, principally to prevent guns from\nfalling into the wrong hands. See Gun Control Act of\n1968, 18 U. S. C. §921 et seq. Under §922(g), certain classes\n2                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nof people—felons, drug addicts, and the mentally ill, to\nlist a few—may not purchase or possess any firearm. And\nto ensure they do not, §922(d) forbids a licensed dealer\nfrom selling a gun to anyone it knows, or has reasonable\ncause to believe, is such a prohibited buyer. See Huddle-\nston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 825 (1974) (“[T]he\nfocus of the federal scheme,” in controlling access to weap-\nons, “is the federally licensed firearms dealer”).\n   The statute establishes a detailed scheme to enable the\ndealer to verify, at the point of sale, whether a potential\nbuyer may lawfully own a gun. Section 922(c) brings the\nwould-be purchaser onto the dealer’s “business premises”\nby prohibiting, except in limited circumstances, the sale of\na firearm “to a person who does not appear in person” at\nthat location. Other provisions then require the dealer to\ncheck and make use of certain identifying information\nreceived from the buyer. Before completing any sale, the\ndealer must “verif[y] the identity of the transferee by\nexamining a valid identification document” bearing a\nphotograph. §922(t)(1)(C). In addition, the dealer must\nprocure the buyer’s “name, age, and place of residence.”\n§922(b)(5). And finally, the dealer must (with limited\nexceptions not at issue here1) submit that information\nto the National Instant Background Check System (NICS)\nto determine whether the potential purchaser is for\nany reason disqualified from owning a firearm. See\n§§922(t)(1)(A)–(B).\n   The statute further insists that the dealer keep certain\nrecords, to enable federal authorities both to enforce the\nlaw’s verification measures and to trace firearms used in\ncrimes. See H. R. Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 14\n\n——————\n    1 The\n        principal exception is for any buyer who has a state permit that\nhas been “issued only after an authorized government official has\nverified” the buyer’s eligibility to own a gun under both federal and\nstate law. §922(t)(3).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)              3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(1968). A dealer must maintain the identifying infor-\nmation mentioned above (i.e., name, age, and residence) in\nits permanent files. See §922(b)(5). In addition, the dealer\nmust keep “such records of . . . sale[ ] or other disposi-\ntion of firearms . . . as the Attorney General may by regu-\nlations prescribe.” §923(g)(1)(A). And the Attorney Gen-\neral (or his designee) may obtain and inspect any of those\nrecords, “in the course of a bona fide criminal investiga-\ntion,” to “determin[e] the disposition of 1 or more fire-\narms.” §923(g)(7).\n   To implement all those statutory requirements, the\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\n(ATF) developed Form 4473 for gun sales. See Supp. App.\n1–6. The part of that form to be completed by the buyer\nrequests his name, birth date, and address, as well as\ncertain other identifying information (for example, his\nheight, weight, and race). The form further lists all the\nfactors disqualifying a person from gun ownership, and\nasks the would-be buyer whether any of them apply (e.g.,\n“[h]ave you ever been convicted . . . of a felony?”). Id., at 1.\nMost important here, Question 11.a. asks (with bolded\nemphasis appearing on the form itself):\n    “Are you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s)\n    listed on this form? Warning: You are not the ac-\n    tual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on\n    behalf of another person. If you are not the ac-\n    tual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the fire-\n    arm(s) to you.” Ibid.\nThe accompanying instructions for that question provide:\n    “Question 11.a. Actual Transferee/Buyer: For\n    purposes of this form, you are the actual transferee/\n    buyer if you are purchasing the firearm for yourself\n    or otherwise acquiring the firearm for yourself . . . .\n    You are also the actual transferee/buyer if you are le-\n    gitimately purchasing the firearm as a gift for a third\n4               ABRAMSKI v.

That certification pro-\nvides that the signator “understand[s] that making any\nfalse . . . statement” respecting the transaction—and,\nparticularly, “answering ‘yes’ to question 11.a. if [he is] not\nthe actual buyer”—is a crime “punishable as a felony\nunder Federal law.” Ibid. (bold typeface deleted).\n  Two statutory provisions, each designed to ensure that\nthe dealer can rely on the truthfulness of the buyer’s dis-\nclosures in carrying out its obligations, criminalize certain\nfalse statements about firearms transactions. First and\nforemost, §922(a)(6), provides as follows:\n    “It shall be unlawful . . . for any person in connection\n    with the acquisition or attempted acquisition of any\n    firearm or ammunition from [a licensed dealer] know-\n    ingly to make any false or fictitious oral or written\n    statement . . . , intended or likely to deceive such\n    [dealer] with respect to any fact material to the law-\n    fulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm\n    or ammunition under the provisions of this chapter.”\nThat provision helps make certain that a dealer will re-\nceive truthful information as to any matter relevant to a\ngun sale’s legality. In addition, §924(a)(1)(A) prohibits\n“knowingly mak[ing] any false statement or representa-\ntion with respect to the information required by this chap-\nter to be kept in the records” of a federally licensed gun\ndealer. The question in this case is whether, as the ATF\ndeclares in Form 4473’s certification, those statutory\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovisions criminalize a false answer to Question 11.a.—\nthat is, a customer’s statement that he is the “actual\ntransferee/buyer,” purchasing a firearm for himself, when\nin fact he is a straw purchaser, buying the gun on someone\nelse’s behalf.\n                              B\n   The petitioner here is Bruce Abramski, a former police\nofficer who offered to buy a Glock 19 handgun for his\nuncle, Angel Alvarez. (Abramski thought he could get the\ngun for a discount by showing his old police identification,\nthough the Government contends that because he had\nbeen fired from his job two years earlier, he was no longer\nauthorized to use that card.) Accepting his nephew’s offer,\nAlvarez sent Abramski a check for $400 with “Glock 19\nhandgun” written on the memo line. Two days later,\nAbramski went to Town Police Supply, a federally licensed\nfirearms dealer, to make the purchase. There, he filled\nout Form 4473, falsely checking “Yes” in reply to Question\n11.a.—that is, asserting he was the “actual transferee/\nbuyer” when, according to the form’s clear definition, he\nwas not. He also signed the requisite certification, ac-\nknowledging his understanding that a false answer to\nQuestion 11.a. is a federal crime. After Abramski’s name\ncleared the NICS background check, the dealer sold him\nthe Glock. Abramski then deposited the $400 check in his\nbank account, transferred the gun to Alvarez, and got back\na receipt. Federal agents found that receipt while execut-\ning a search warrant at Abramski’s home after he became\na suspect in a different crime.\n   A grand jury indicted Abramski for violating §§922(a)(6)\nand 924(a)(1)(A) by falsely affirming in his response to\nQuestion 11.a. that he was the Glock’s actual buyer.\nAbramski moved to dismiss both charges. He argued that\nhis misrepresentation on Question 11.a. was not “material\nto the lawfulness of the sale” under §922(a)(6) because\n6                 ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nAlvarez was legally eligible to own a gun. And he claimed\nthat the false statement did not violate §924(a)(1)(A)\nbecause a buyer’s response to Question 11.a. is not “re-\nquired . . . to be kept in the records” of a gun dealer. After\nthe District Court denied those motions, see 778 F. Supp.\n2d 678 (WD Va. 2011), Abramski entered a conditional\nguilty plea, reserving his right to challenge the rulings.\nThe District Court then sentenced him to five years of\nprobation on each count, running concurrently.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the\nconvictions. 706 F. 3d 307 (2013). It noted a division\namong appellate courts on the question Abramski raised\nabout §922(a)(6)’s materiality requirement: Of three courts\nto have addressed the issue, one agreed with Abramski\nthat a misrepresentation on Question 11.a. is immaterial\nif “the true purchaser [here, Alvarez] can lawfully pur-\nchase a firearm directly.” Id., at 315 (quoting United\nStates v. Polk, 118 F. 3d 286, 295 (CA5 1997)).2 The\nFourth Circuit, however, thought the majority position\ncorrect: “[T]he identity of the actual purchaser of a firearm\nis a constant that is always material to the lawfulness of a\nfirearm acquisition under §922(a)(6).” 706 F. 3d, at 316.\nThe court also held that Abramski’s conviction under\n§924(a)(1)(A) was valid, finding that the statute required a\ndealer to maintain the information at issue in its records.\nId., at 317.\n   We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013), principally\nto resolve the Circuit split about §922(a)(6). In this Court,\nAbramski renews his claim that a false answer to Ques-\ntion 11.a. is immaterial if the true buyer is legally eligible\nto purchase a firearm. But Abramski now focuses on a\n——————\n  2 Compare Polk, 118 F. 3d, at 294–295, with United States v.

See Brief for Petitioner i.3\nIn brief, he alleges that a false response to Question 11.a.\nis never material to a gun sale’s legality, whether or not\nthe actual buyer is eligible to own a gun. We begin with\nthat fundamental question, next turn to what has become\nAbramski’s back-up argument under §922(a)(6), and fi-\nnally consider the relatively easy question pertaining to\n§924(A)(1)(a)’s separate false-statement prohibition. On\neach score, we affirm Abramski’s conviction.\n                             II\n  Abramski’s broad theory (mostly echoed by the dissent)\nis that federal gun law simply does not care about ar-\nrangements involving straw purchasers: So long as the\nperson at the counter is eligible to own a gun, the sale to\nhim is legal under the statute. That is true, Abramski\ncontends, irrespective of any agreement that person has\nmade to purchase the firearm on behalf of someone else—\nincluding someone who cannot lawfully buy or own a gun\nhimself.    Accordingly, Abramski concludes, his “false\nstatement that he was the [Glock 19’s] ‘actual buyer,’ ” as\nthat term was “defined in Question 11.a., was not material”\n—indeed, was utterly irrelevant—“to the lawfulness of\nthe sale.” Id., at 31 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 4\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.). In essence, he claims, Town Police\nSupply could legally have sold the gun to him even if had\ntruthfully answered Question 11.a. by disclosing that he\nwas a straw—because, again, all the federal firearms law\ncares about is whether the individual standing at the\n\n——————\n  3 Reflecting that prior consensus, neither of Abramski’s principal\n\namici—the National Rifle Association and a group of 26 States—joins\nAbramski in making this broader argument. They confine themselves\nto supporting the more limited claim about straw purchases made on\nbehalf of eligible gun owners, addressed infra, at 19–22.\n8                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndealer’s counter meets the requirements to buy a gun.4\n   At its core, that argument relies on one true fact: Fed-\neral gun law regulates licensed dealers’ transactions with\n“persons” or “transferees,” without specifically referencing\nstraw purchasers. Section 922(d), for example, bars a\ndealer from “sell[ing] or otherwise dispos[ing] of ” a fire-\narm to any “person” who falls within a prohibited category—\nfelons, drug addicts, the mentally ill, and so forth. See\nsupra, at 1–2; see also §922(b)(5) (before selling a gun to a\n“person,” the dealer must take down his name, age, and\nresidence); §922(t)(1) (before selling a gun to a “person,”\nthe dealer must run a background check). Similarly,\n§922(t)(1)(C) requires the dealer to verify the identity of\nthe “transferee” by checking a valid photo ID. See supra,\nat 2; see also §922(c) (spelling out circumstances in which\na “transferee” may buy a gun without appearing at the\ndealer’s premises). Abramski contends that Congress’s\nuse of such language alone, sans any mention of “straw\npurchasers” or “actual buyers,” shows that “[i]t is not\nillegal to buy a gun for someone else.” Brief for Petitioner\n15–16; Reply Brief 1; see also post, at 2–6.\n——————\n   4 The dissent reserves the question whether the false statement\n\nwould be material if the straw purchaser knew that the true buyer was\nnot eligible to own a firearm. Post, at 6, n. 2. But first, that reserva-\ntion is of quite limited scope: Unlike Abramski’s back-up argument,\nwhich imposes liability whenever the true purchaser cannot legally buy\na gun, the dissent’s reservation applies only when the straw has\nknowledge of (or at least reasonable cause to believe) that fact. And as\nwe will later note, straws often do not have such knowledge. See infra,\nat 12–13. Second, the reservation (fairly enough for a reservation) rests\non an uncertain legal theory. According to the dissent, a straw buyer\nmight violate §922(a)(6) if a dealer’s sale to him aids and abets his\nviolation of §922(d)—a provision barring knowingly transferring a gun\nto an ineligible person, see infra, at 8, 17–18. But that reasoning\npresupposes that a firearms dealer acting in the ordinary course of\nbusiness can ever have the intent needed to aid and abet a crime—a\nquestion this Court reserved not six months ago. See Rosemond v.\nUnited States, 572 U. S. ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12, n. 8).\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  But that language merely raises, rather than answers,\nthe critical question: In a straw purchase, who is the\n“person” or “transferee” whom federal gun law addresses?\nIs that “person” the middleman buying a firearm on some-\none else’s behalf (often because the ultimate recipient\ncould not buy it himself, or wants to camouflage the trans-\naction)? Or is that “person” instead the individual really\npaying for the gun and meant to take possession of it upon\ncompletion of the purchase? Is it the conduit at the coun-\nter, or the gun’s intended owner?5 In answering that in-\nquiry, we must (as usual) interpret the relevant words not\nin a vacuum, but with reference to the statutory context,\n“structure, history, and purpose.” Maracich v. Spears, 570\nU. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 26). All those tools of\ndivining meaning—not to mention common sense, which is\na fortunate (though not inevitable) side-benefit of constru-\ning statutory terms fairly—demonstrate that §922, in\nregulating licensed dealers’ gun sales, looks through the\nstraw to the actual buyer.6\n——————\n  5 The dissent claims the answer is easy because “if I give my son $10\n\nand tell him to pick up milk and eggs at the store, no English speaker\nwould say that the store ‘sells’ the milk and eggs to me.” Post, at 4.\nBut try a question more similar to the one the gun law’s text raises: If I\nsend my brother to the Apple Store with money and instructions to\npurchase an iPhone, and then take immediate and sole possession of\nthat device, am I the “person” (or “transferee”) who has bought the\nphone or is he? Nothing in ordinary English usage compels an answer\neither way.\n  6 Contrary to the dissent’s view, our analysis does not rest on mere\n\n“purpose-based arguments.” Post. at 7. We simply recognize that a\ncourt should not interpret each word in a statute with blinders on,\nrefusing to look at the word’s function within the broader statutory\ncontext. As we have previously put the point, a “provision that may\nseem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the\nstatutory scheme . . . because only one of the permissible meanings\nproduces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the\nlaw.” United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates,\nLtd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988).\n10                 ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  The overarching reason is that Abramski’s reading\nwould undermine—indeed, for all important purposes,\nwould virtually repeal—the gun law’s core provisions.7 As\nnoted earlier, the statute establishes an elaborate system\nto verify a would-be gun purchaser’s identity and check on\nhis background. See supra, at 2. It also requires that the\ninformation so gathered go into a dealer’s permanent\nrecords. See supra, at 2–3. The twin goals of this com-\nprehensive scheme are to keep guns out of the hands of\ncriminals and others who should not have them, and to\nassist law enforcement authorities in investigating serious\ncrimes. See Huddleston, 415 U. S., at 824; supra, at 2–3.\nAnd no part of that scheme would work if the statute\nturned a blind eye to straw purchases—if, in other words,\nthe law addressed not the substance of a transaction, but\nonly empty formalities.\n  To see why, consider what happens in a typical straw\npurchase. A felon or other person who cannot buy or own\na gun still wants to obtain one. (Or, alternatively, a per-\nson who could legally buy a firearm wants to conceal his\npurchase, maybe so he can use the gun for criminal pur-\nposes without fear that police officers will later trace it to\nhim.) Accordingly, the prospective buyer enlists an inter-\nmediary to help him accomplish his illegal aim. Perhaps\nhe conscripts a loyal friend or family member; perhaps\nmore often, he hires a stranger to purchase the gun for a\nprice. The actual purchaser might even accompany the\nstraw to the gun shop, instruct him which firearm to buy,\ngive him the money to pay at the counter, and take pos-\nsession as they walk out the door. See, e.g., United States\n——————\n   7 That reading would also, at a stroke, declare unlawful a large part\n\nof what the ATF does to combat gun trafficking by criminals. See Dept.\nof Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, Following the\nGun: Enforcing Federal Laws Against Firearms Traffickers, p. xi (June\n2000) (noting that in several prior years “[a]lmost half of all [ATF\nfirearm] trafficking investigations involved straw purchasers”).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nv. Bowen, 207 Fed. Appx. 727, 729 (CA7 2006) (describing\na straw purchase along those lines); United States v. Paye,\n129 Fed. Appx. 567, 570 (CA11 2005) (per curiam) (same).\nWhat the true buyer would not do—what he would leave\nto the straw, who possesses the gun for all of a minute—is\ngive his identifying information to the dealer and submit\nhimself to a background check. How many of the statute’s\nprovisions does that scenario—the lawful result of\nAbramski’s (and the dissent’s) reading of “transferee” and\n“person”—render meaningless?\n   Start with the parts of §922 enabling a dealer to verify\nwhether a buyer is legally eligible to own a firearm. That\ntask, as noted earlier, begins with identification—\nrequesting the name, address, and age of the potential\npurchaser and checking his photo ID. See §§922(b)(5),\n(t)(1)(C); supra, at 2. And that identification in turn per-\nmits a background check: The dealer runs the purchaser’s\nname through the NICS database to discover whether he\nis, for example, a felon, drug addict, or mentally ill person.\nSee §§922(d), (t)(1); supra, at 2. All those provisions are\ndesigned to accomplish what this Court has previously\ntermed Congress’s “principal purpose” in enacting the\nstatute—“to curb crime by keeping ‘firearms out of the\nhands of those not legally entitled to possess them.’ ”\nHuddleston, 415 U. S., at 824 (quoting S. Rep. No. 1501,\n90th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1968)). But under Abramski’s\nreading, the statutory terms would be utterly ineffectual,\nbecause the identification and background check would be\nof the wrong person. The provisions would evaluate the\neligibility of mere conduits, while allowing every criminal\n(and drug addict and so forth) to escape that assessment\nand walk away with a weapon.\n   Similarly, Abramski’s view would defeat the point of\n§922(c), which tightly restricts the sale of guns “to a per-\nson who does not appear in person at the licensee’s busi-\nness premises.” See supra, at 2. Only a narrow class of\n12              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprospective buyers may ever purchase a gun from afar—\nprimarily, individuals who have already had their eligibil-\nity to own a firearm verified by state law enforcement\nofficials with access to the NICS database. See 27 CFR\n§478.96(b) (2014), 18 U. S. C. §922(t)(3); n. 1, supra. And\neven when an individual fits within that category, he still\nmust submit to the dealer a sworn statement that he can\nlawfully own a gun, as well as provide the name and ad-\ndress of the principal law enforcement officer in his com-\nmunity. See §922(c)(1). The dealer then has to forward\nnotice of the sale to that officer, in order to allow law\nenforcement authorities to investigate the legality of the\nsale and, if necessary, call a stop to it. See §§922(c)(2)–(3).\nThe provision thus prevents remote sales except to a small\nclass of buyers subject to extraordinary procedures—\nagain, to ensure effective verification of a potential pur-\nchaser’s eligibility. Yet on Abramski’s view, a person\ncould easily bypass the scheme, purchasing a gun without\never leaving his home by dispatching to a gun store a\nhired deliveryman. Indeed, if Abramski were right, we see\nno reason why anyone (and certainly anyone with less-\nthan-pure motives) would put himself through the proce-\ndures laid out in §922(c): Deliverymen, after all, are not so\nhard to come by.\n   And likewise, the statute’s record-keeping provisions\nwould serve little purpose if the records kept were of\nnominal rather than real buyers. As noted earlier, dealers\nmust store, and law enforcement officers may obtain,\ninformation about a gun buyer’s identity. See §§922(b)(5),\n923(g); supra, at 3. That information helps to fight serious\ncrime. When police officers retrieve a gun at a crime\nscene, they can trace it to the buyer and consider him as a\nsuspect. See National Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc. v.\nJones, 716 F. 3d 200, 204 (CADC 2013) (describing law\nenforcement’s use of firearm tracing). Too, the required\nrecords enable dealers to identify certain suspicious pur-\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nchasing trends, which they then must report to federal\nauthorities. See §923(g)(3) (imposing a reporting obliga-\ntion when a person buys multiple handguns within five\ndays). But once again, those provisions can serve their\nobjective only if the records point to the person who took\nactual control of the gun(s). Otherwise, the police will at\nmost learn the identity of an intermediary, who could not\nhave been responsible for the gun’s use and might know\nnext to nothing about the actual buyer. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Juarez, 626 F. 3d 246, 249 (CA5 2010) (straw\npurchaser bought military-style assault rifles, later found\namong Mexican gang members, for a buyer known “only as\n‘El Mano’ ”). Abramski’s view would thus render the re-\nquired records close to useless for aiding law enforcement:\nPutting true numbskulls to one side, anyone purchasing a\ngun for criminal purposes would avoid leaving a paper\ntrail by the simple expedient of hiring a straw.\n   To sum up so far: All the prerequisites for buying a gun\ndescribed above refer to a “person” or “transferee.” Read\nAbramski’s way (“the man at the counter”), those terms\ndeny effect to the regulatory scheme, as criminals could\nalways use straw purchasers to evade the law.8 Read the\nother way (“the man getting, and always meant to get, the\nfirearm”), those terms give effect to the statutory provi-\n——————\n  8 The dissent is mistaken when it says that the ATF’s own former\n\nview of the statute refutes this proposition. See post, at 11–12. As we\nwill later discuss, see infra, at 21–22, the ATF for a time thought that\n§922(a)(6) did not cover cases in which the true purchaser could have\nlegally purchased a gun himself. But Abramski’s principal argument\nextends much further, to cases in which straws buy weapons for crimi-\nnals, drug addicts, and other prohibited purchasers. For the reasons\njust stated, that interpretation would render the statute all but useless.\nAnd although the dissent appeals to a snippet of congressional testi-\nmony to suggest that ATF once briefly held that extreme view of the\nstatute, it agrees that by at least 1979 (well over three decades ago),\nATF recognized the unlawfulness of straw purchases on behalf of\nprohibited persons.\n14              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsions, allowing them to accomplish their manifest objects.\nThat alone provides more than sufficient reason to under-\nstand “person” and “transferee” as referring not to the\nfictitious but to the real buyer.\n   And other language in §922 confirms that construction,\nby evincing Congress’s concern with the practical realities,\nrather than the legal niceties, of firearms transactions.\nFor example, §922(a)(6) itself bars material misrepresen-\ntations “in connection with the acquisition,” and not just\nthe purchase, of a firearm. That broader word, we have\npreviously held, does not focus on “legal title”—let alone\nlegal title for a few short moments, until another, always\nintended transfer occurs. Huddleston, 415 U. S., at 820.\nInstead, the term signifies “com[ing] into possession,\ncontrol, or power of disposal,” as the actual buyer in a\nstraw purchase does. Ibid. Similarly, we have reasoned\nthat such a substance-over-form approach draws support\nfrom the statute’s repeated references to “the sale or other\ndisposition” of a firearm. §922(a)(6); see §922(d) (making\nit unlawful to “sell or otherwise dispose of ” a gun to a\nprohibited person). That term, we have stated, “was\naimed at providing maximum coverage.” Id., at 826–827.\nWe think such expansive language inconsistent with\nAbramski’s view of the statute, which would stare myopi-\ncally at the nominal buyer while remaining blind to the\nperson exiting the transaction with control of the gun.\n   Finally, our reading of §922 comports with courts’\nstandard practice, evident in many legal spheres and\npresumably known to Congress, of ignoring artifice when\nidentifying the parties to a transaction. In United States\nv. One 1936 Model Ford V-8 Deluxe Coach, Commercial\nCredit Co., 307 U. S. 219 (1939), for example, we consid-\nered the operation of a statute requiring forfeiture of any\ninterest in property that was used to violate prohibition\nlaws, except if acquired in good faith. There, a straw\npurchaser had bought a car in his name but with his\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbrother’s money, and transferred it to the brother—a\nknown bootlegger—right after driving it off the lot. See\nid., at 222–223. The Court held the finance company’s lien\non the car non-forfeitable because the company had no\nhint that the straw was a straw—that his brother would\nin fact be the owner. See id., at 224. But had the com-\npany known, the Court made clear, a different result would\nhave obtained: The company could not have relied on the\nformalities of the sale to the “ ‘straw’ purchaser” when it\nknew that the “real owner and purchaser” of the car was\nsomeone different. Id., at 223–224. We have similarly\nemphasized the need in other contexts, involving both\ncriminal and civil penalties, to look through a transac-\ntion’s nominal parties to its true participants. See, e.g.,\nAmerican Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 560\nU. S. 183, 193 (2010) (focusing on “substance rather than\nform” in assessing when entities are distinct enough to be\ncapable of conspiring to violate the antitrust laws); Gregory\nv. Helvering, 293 U. S. 465, 470 (1935) (disregarding an\nintermediary shell corporation created to avoid taxes\nbecause doing otherwise would “exalt artifice above reality”).\nWe do no more than that here in holding, consistent\nwith §922’s text, structure, and purpose, that using a\nstraw does not enable evasion of the firearms law.\n   Abramski, along with the dissent, objects that such\naction is no circumvention—that Congress made an inten-\ntional choice, born of “political compromise,” to limit the\ngun law’s compass to the person at the counter, even if\nmerely acting on another’s behalf. Reply Brief 11; post, at\n10–11. As evidence, Abramski states that the statute does\nnot regulate beyond the initial point of sale. Because the\nlaw mostly addresses sales made by licensed dealers, a\npurchaser can (within wide limits) subsequently decide to\nresell his gun to another private party. See Reply Brief\n11. And similarly, Abramski says, a purchaser can buy a\ngun for someone else as a gift. See Brief for Petitioner 26–\n16                ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n27, n. 3. Abramski lumps in the same category the trans-\nfer of a gun from a nominal to a real buyer—as something,\nlike a later resale or gift, meant to fall outside the stat-\nute’s     (purported)    standing-in-front-of-the-gun-dealer\nscope. See Reply Brief 13; see also post, at 7–9.\n   But Abramski and the dissent draw the wrong conclu-\nsion from their observations about resales and gifts. Yes,\nCongress decided to regulate dealers’ sales, while leaving\nthe secondary market for guns largely untouched. As we\nnoted in Huddleston, Congress chose to make the dealer\nthe “principal agent of federal enforcement” in “restricting\n[criminals’] access to firearms.” 415 U. S., at 824. And\nyes, that choice (like pretty much everything Congress\ndoes) was surely a result of compromise. But no, straw\narrangements are not a part of the secondary market,\nseparate and apart from the dealer’s sale. In claiming as\nmuch, Abramski merely repeats his mistaken assumption\nthat the “person” who acquires a gun from a dealer in a\ncase like this one is the straw, rather than the individual\nwho has made a prior arrangement to pay for, take pos-\nsession of, own, and use that part of the dealer’s stock.\nFor all the reasons we have already given, that is not a\nplausible construction of a statute mandating that the\ndealer identify and run a background check on the person\nto whom it is (really, not fictitiously) selling a gun. See\nsupra, at 9–15. The individual who sends a straw to a gun\nstore to buy a firearm is transacting with the dealer, in\nevery way but the most formal; and that distinguishes\nsuch a person from one who buys a gun, or receives a gun\nas a gift, from a private party.9 The line Congress drew\n——————\n  9 The dissent responds: “That certainly distinguishes” the individual\n\ntransacting with a dealer through a straw from an individual receiving\na gun from a private party; “so would the fact that [the former] has\norange hair.” Post, at 9. But that is an example of wit gone wrong.\nWhether the purchaser has orange hair, we can all agree, is immaterial\nto the statutory scheme. By contrast, whether the purchaser has\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween those who acquire guns from dealers and those\nwho get them as gifts or on the secondary market, we\nsuspect, reflects a host of things, including administrative\nsimplicity and a view about where the most problematic\nfirearm transactions—like criminal organizations’ bulk\ngun purchases—typically occur. But whatever the reason,\nthe scarcity of controls in the secondary market provides\nno reason to gut the robust measures Congress enacted at\nthe point of sale.\n   Abramski claims further support for his argument from\nCongress’s decision in 1986 to amend §922(d) to prohibit a\nprivate party (and not just, as originally enacted, a li-\ncensed dealer) from selling a gun to someone he knows or\nreasonably should know cannot legally possess one. See\nFirearm Owners’ Protection Act, §102(5)(A), 100 Stat.\n451–452. According to Abramski, the revised §922(d)\nshould be understood as Congress’s exclusive response to\nthe potential dangers arising from straw purchases. See\nBrief for Petitioner 26–27. The amendment shows, he\nclaims, that “Congress chose to address this perceived\nproblem in a way other than” by imposing liability under\n§922(a)(6) on a straw who tells a licensed dealer that he is\nthe firearm’s actual buyer. Reply Brief 14, n. 2.\n   But Congress’s amendment of §922(d) says nothing\nabout §922(a)(6)’s application to straw purchasers. In en-\nacting that amendment, Congress left §922(a)(6) just as\nit was, undercutting any suggestion that Congress some-\n——————\ntransacted with a licensed dealer is integral to the statute—because, as\npreviously noted, “the federal scheme . . . controls access to weapons”\nthrough the federally licensed firearms dealer, who is “the principal\nagent of federal enforcement.” Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S.\n814, 824, 825 (1974); see supra, at 16. In so designing the statute,\nCongress chose not to pursue the goal of “controll[ing] access” to guns to\nthe nth degree; buyers can, as the dissent says, avoid the statute’s\nbackground check and record-keeping requirements by getting a gun\nsecond-hand. But that possibility provides no justification for limiting\nthe statute’s considered regulation of dealer sales.\n18                ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhow intended to contract that provision’s reach. The\namendment instead performed a different function: Rather\nthan ensuring that a licensed dealer receives truthful\ninformation, it extended a minimal form of regulation to\nthe secondary market. The revised §922(d) prevents a\nprivate person from knowingly selling a gun to an ineligi-\nble owner no matter when or how he acquired the weapon:\nIt thus applies not just to a straw purchaser, but to an\nindividual who bought a gun for himself and later decided\nto resell it. At the same time, §922(d) has nothing to say\nabout a raft of cases §922(a)(6) covers, including all the\n(many) straw purchases in which the frontman does not\nknow that the actual buyer is ineligible. See supra, at 13.\nThus, §922(d) could not serve as an effective substitute for\n§922(a)(6). And the mere potential for some transactions\nto run afoul of both prohibitions gives no cause to read\n§922(d) as limiting §922(a)(6) (or vice versa). See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Batchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 118–126\n(1979).10\n  Abramski’s principal attack on his §922(a)(6) conviction\ntherefore fails. Contrary to his contention, the infor-\nmation Question 11.a. requests—“[a]re you the actual\ntransferee/buyer[?]” or, put conversely, “are [you] acquir-\n——————\n  10 Nor do we agree with the dissent’s argument (not urged by\n\nAbramski himself) that the rule of lenity defeats our construction. See\npost, at 12–14. That rule, as we have repeatedly emphasized, applies\nonly if, “after considering text, structure, history and purpose, there\nremains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that\nthe Court must simply guess as to what Congress intended.” Maracich\nv. Spears, 570 U. S ___, ___ (2013) (slip op. at 26) (quoting Barber v.\nThomas, 560 U.S. 474, 488 (2010)). We are not in that position here:\nAlthough the text creates some ambiguity, the context, structure,\nhistory, and purpose resolve it. The dissent would apply the rule of\nlenity here because the statute’s text, taken alone, permits a narrower\nconstruction, but we have repeatedly emphasized that is not the appro-\npriate test. See, e.g., Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 138\n(1998); Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 239 (1993).\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning the firearm(s) on behalf of another person[?]”—is\nrelevant to the lawfulness of a gun sale. That is because,\nfor all the reasons we have given, the firearms law con-\ntemplates that the dealer will check not the fictitious\npurchaser’s but instead the true purchaser’s identity and\neligibility for gun ownership. By concealing that Alvarez\nwas the actual buyer, Abramski prevented the dealer from\ntransacting with Alvarez face-to-face, see §922(c), record-\ning his name, age, and residence, see §922(b)(5), inspect-\ning his photo ID, see §922(t)(1)(C), submitting his identify-\ning information to the background check system, see\n§922(t)(1)(B), and determining whether he was prohibited\nfrom receiving a firearm, see §922(d). In sum, Abramski\nthwarted application of essentially all of the firearms law’s\nrequirements. We can hardly think of a misrepresentation\nany more material to a sale’s legality.\n                              III\n  Abramski also challenges his §922(a)(6) conviction on a\nnarrower ground. For purposes of this argument, he\nassumes that the Government can make its case when a\nstraw hides the name of an underlying purchaser who is\nlegally ineligible to own a gun. But, Abramski reminds us,\nthat is not true here, because Alvarez could have bought a\ngun for himself. In such circumstances, Abramski claims\nthat a false response to Question 11.a. is not material. See\nBrief for Petitioner 28–30. Essentially, Abramski con-\ntends, when the hidden purchaser is eligible anyway to\nown a gun, all’s well that ends well, and all should be\nforgiven.\n  But we think what we have already said shows the\nfallacy of that claim: Abramski’s false statement was\nmaterial because had he revealed that he was purchasing\nthe gun on Alvarez’s behalf, the sale could not have pro-\nceeded under the law—even though Alvarez turned out to\nbe an eligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter,\n20              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould not have complied with §922(c)’s restrictions on\nabsentee purchases. See supra, at 11–12. If the dealer\nhere, Town Police Supply, had realized it was in fact\nselling a gun to Alvarez, it would have had to stop the\ntransaction for failure to comply with those conditions.\nYet more, the sale could not have gone forward because\nthe dealer would have lacked the information needed to\nverify and record Alvarez’s identity and check his back-\nground. See §§922(b)(5), (t)(1)(B)–(C); supra, at 10–12.\nThose requirements, as we have explained, pertain to the\nreal buyer; and the after-the-fact discovery that Alvarez\nwould have passed the background check cannot somehow\nwipe them away. Accordingly, had Town Police Supply\nknown Abramski was a straw, it could not have certified,\nas Form 4473 demands, its belief that the transfer was\n“not unlawful.” Supp. App. 3.\n  An analogy may help show the weakness of Abramski’s\nargument. Suppose a would-be purchaser, Smith, lawfully\ncould own a gun. But further suppose that, for reasons of\nhis own, Smith uses an alias (let’s say Jones) to make the\npurchase. Would anyone say “no harm, no foul,” just\nbecause Smith is not in fact a prohibited person under\n§922(d)? We think not. Smith would in any event have\nmade a false statement about who will own the gun, im-\npeding the dealer’s ability to carry out its legal responsi-\nbilities. So too here.\n  Abramski objects that because Alvarez could own a gun,\nthe statute’s core purpose—“keeping guns out of the\nhands” of criminals and other prohibited persons—“is not\neven implicated.” Brief for Petitioner 29. But that argu-\nment (which would apply no less to the alias scenario)\nmisunderstands the way the statute works. As earlier\nnoted, the federal gun law makes the dealer “[t]he princi-\npal agent of federal enforcement.” Huddleston, 415 U. S.,\nat 824, see supra, at 16. It is that highly regulated, legally\nknowledgeable entity, possessing access to the expansive\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNICS database, which has the responsibility to “[e]nsure\nthat, in the course of sales or other dispositions . . . ,\nweapons [are not] obtained by individuals whose posses-\nsion of them would be contrary to the public interest.” 415\nU. S., at 825. Nothing could be less consonant with the\nstatutory scheme than placing that inquiry in the hands of\nan unlicensed straw purchaser, who is unlikely to be\nfamiliar with federal firearms law and has no ability to\nuse the database to check whether the true buyer may\nown a gun. And in any event, keeping firearms out of the\nhands of criminals is not §922’s only goal: The statute’s\nrecord-keeping provisions, as we have said, are also de-\nsigned to aid law enforcement in the investigation of\ncrime. See supra, at 2–3, 12–13. Abramski’s proposed\nlimitation on §922(a)(6) would undercut that purpose\nbecause many would-be criminals remain legally eligible\nto buy firearms, and thus could use straws to purchase an\nendless stream of guns off-the-books. See, e.g., Polk, 118\nF. 3d, at 289 (eligible gun buyer used straw purchasers to\nsecretly accumulate an “arsenal of weapons” for a “mas-\nsive offensive” against the Federal Government).\n   In addition, Abramski briefly notes that until 1995, the\nATF took the view that a straw purchaser’s misrepresen-\ntation counted as material only if the true buyer could not\nlegally possess a gun. See Brief for Petitioner 7–8; n. 8,\nsupra. We may put aside that ATF has for almost two\ndecades now taken the opposite position, after reflecting\non both appellate case law and changes in the statute. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 41; Brady Handgun Violence Prevention\nAct of 1993, §103, 107 Stat. 1541 (codified at 18 U. S. C.\n§922(t)). The critical point is that criminal laws are for\ncourts, not for the Government, to construe. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Apel, 571 U. S. ___, (2014) (slip op., at 9)\n(“[W]e have never held that the Government’s reading of a\ncriminal statute is entitled to any deference”). We think\nATF’s old position no more relevant than its current one—\n22              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich is to say, not relevant at all. Whether the Govern-\nment interprets a criminal statute too broadly (as it some-\ntimes does) or too narrowly (as the ATF used to in constru-\ning §922(a)(6)), a court has an obligation to correct its\nerror. Here, nothing suggests that Congress—the entity\nwhose voice does matter—limited its prohibition of a\nstraw purchaser’s misrepresentation in the way Abramski\nproposes.\n                              IV\n  Finally, Abramski challenges his conviction under\n§924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits “knowingly mak[ing] any\nfalse statement . . . with respect to the information re-\nquired by this chapter to be kept in the records” of a feder-\nally licensed dealer. That provision is broader than\n§922(a)(6) in one respect: It does not require that the false\nstatement at issue be “material” in any way. At the same\ntime, §924(a)(1)(A) includes an element absent from\n§922(a)(6): The false statement must relate to “infor-\nmation required by this chapter to be kept in [a dealer’s]\nrecords.” Abramski notes that the indictment in this case\ncharged him with only one misrepresentation: his state-\nment in response to Question 11.a. that he was buying the\nGlock on his own behalf rather than on someone else’s.\nAnd, he argues, that information (unlike the transferee’s\n“name, age, and place of residence,” which he plausibly\nreads the indictment as not mentioning) was not required\n“by this chapter”—but only by Form 4473 itself—to be kept\nin the dealer’s permanent records. Brief for Petitioner 32.\n  We disagree. Included in “this chapter”—Chapter 44 of\nTitle 18—is a provision, noted earlier, requiring a dealer\nto “maintain such records of . . . sale, or other disposition\nof firearms at his place of business for such period, and in\nsuch form, as the Attorney General may by regulations\nprescribe.” §923(g)(1)(A); supra, at 3. Because of that\nstatutory section, the information that the Attorney Gen-\neral’s regulations compel a dealer to keep is information\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n“required by this chapter.” And those regulations (the\nvalidity of which Abramski does not here contest) demand\nthat every licensed dealer “retain . . . as a part of [its]\nrequired records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course\nof ” selling or otherwise disposing of a firearm. 27 CFR\n§478.124(b). Accordingly, a false answer on that form,\nsuch as the one Abramski made, pertains to information a\ndealer is statutorily required to maintain.11\n                              V\n   No piece of information is more important under federal\nfirearms law than the identity of a gun’s purchaser—the\nperson who acquires a gun as a result of a transaction\nwith a licensed dealer. Had Abramski admitted that he\nwas not that purchaser, but merely a straw—that he was\nasking the dealer to verify the identity of, and run a back-\nground check on, the wrong individual—the sale here\ncould not have gone forward. That makes Abramski’s\nmisrepresentation on Question 11.a. material under\n§922(a)(6). And because that statement pertained to\ninformation that a dealer must keep in its permanent\nrecords under the firearms law, Abramski’s answer to\nQuestion 11.a. also violated §924(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, we\naffirm the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\n——————\n  11 The dissent argues that our view would impose criminal liability for\n\na false answer even to an “ultra vires question,” such as “the buyer’s\nfavorite color.” Post, at 15. We need not, and do not, opine on that\nhypothetical, because it is miles away from this case. As we have\nexplained, see supra at 9–19, Question 11.a. is not ultra vires, but\ninstead fundamental to the lawfulness of a gun sale. It is, indeed, part\nand parcel of the dealer’s determination of the (true) buyer’s “name,\nage, and place of residence,” which §922(b)(5) requires the dealer to\nkeep. That section alone would justify Abramski’s conviction under\n§924(a)(1)(A) if the indictment here had clearly alleged that, in addition\nto answering Question 11.a. falsely, he lied about that buyer’s “name,\nage, and place of residence.”\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

Both men were legally eligible to receive\nand possess firearms, and Abramski transferred the gun\nto his uncle at a federally licensed gun dealership in com-\npliance with state law. When buying the gun, Abramski\nhad to fill out Form 4473 issued by the Bureau of Alcohol,\nTobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). In response to a\nquestion on the form, Abramski affirmed that he was the\n“actual/transferee buyer” of the gun, even though the form\nstated that he was not the “actual transferee/buyer” if he\nwas purchasing the gun for a third party at that person’s\nrequest and with funds provided by that person.\n  The Government charged Abramski with two federal\ncrimes under the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended, 18\nU. S. C. §§921–931: making a false statement “material to\nthe lawfulness of the sale,” in violation of §922(a)(6), and\nmaking a false statement “with respect to information\nrequired by [the Act] to be kept” by the dealer, in violation\nof §924(a)(1)(A). On both counts the Government inter-\nprets this criminal statute to punish conduct that its plain\nlanguage simply does not reach. I respectfully dissent\nfrom the Court’s holding to the contrary.\n2               ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n                      I. Section 922(a)(6)\n                               A\n   Under §922(a)(6), it is a crime to make a “false . . .\nstatement” to a licensed gun dealer about a “fact material\nto the lawfulness of ” a firearms sale. Abramski made a\nfalse statement when he claimed to be the gun’s “actual\ntransferee/buyer” as Form 4473 defined that term. But\nthat false statement was not “material to the lawfulness of\nthe sale” since the truth—that Abramski was buying the\ngun for his uncle with his uncle’s money—would not have\nmade the sale unlawful. See Kungys v. United States, 485\nU. S. 759, 775 (1988) (plurality opinion) (materiality is\ndetermined by asking “what would have ensued from\nofficial knowledge of the misrepresented fact”); accord id.,\nat 787 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Therefore,\nAbramski’s conviction on this count cannot stand.\n   Several provisions of the Act limit the circumstances in\nwhich a licensed gun dealer may lawfully sell a firearm.\nMost prominently, the Act provides that no one may “sell\nor otherwise dispose of ” a firearm to a person who he\nknows or has reasonable cause to believe falls within one\nof nine prohibited categories (such as felons, fugitives,\nillegal-drug users, and the mentally ill). §922(d). But the\nGovernment does not contend that either Abramski or his\nuncle fell into one of those prohibited categories. And no\nprovision of the Act prohibits one person who is eligible to\nreceive and possess firearms (e.g., Abramski) from buying\na gun for another person who is eligible to receive and\npossess firearms (e.g., Abramski’s uncle), even at the\nother’s request and with the other’s money.\n   The Government’s contention that Abramski’s false\nstatement was material to the lawfulness of the sale de-\npends on a strained interpretation of provisions that\nmention the “person” to whom a dealer “sell[s]” (or “trans-\nfer[s],” or “deliver[s]”) a gun. A dealer may not “sell or\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

He may not, without following special proce-\ndures, “sell” a firearm to a “person” who does not appear in\nperson at the dealer’s business. §922(c). He may not\n“transfer” a firearm to a “person” without verifying that\nperson’s identity and running a background check.\n§922(t)(1). And he may not “sell or deliver” a firearm to a\n“person” who he knows or has reasonable cause to believe\nresides in a different State. §922(b)(3).\n   The Government maintains that in this case Abramski’s\nuncle was the “person” to whom the dealer “s[old]” the\ngun, and that the sale consequently violated those provi-\nsions. It bases that assertion on the claim that the Gun\nControl Act implicitly incorporates “principles of agency\nlaw.” Brief for United States 17. Under those principles,\nit contends, the individual who walks into a dealer’s store,\nfills out the requisite forms, pays the dealer, and takes\npossession of the gun is not necessarily the “person” to\nwhom the dealer “sell[s]” the gun. Instead, it says, we\nmust ask whether that individual bought the gun as a\nthird party’s common-law agent; if so, then the third party\nis the “person” to whom the dealer “sell[s]” the gun within\nthe meaning of the relevant statutory provisions. The\nmajority agrees: Although it never explicitly mentions\nagency law, it declares that if an individual is “buying a\nfirearm on someone else’s behalf,” the “someone else” is\nthe “person” to whom the dealer “sell[s]” the gun within\nthe meaning of the statute. Ante, at 9.\n   I doubt that three of the four provisions at issue here\nwould establish the materiality of Abramski’s falsehood\neven if Abramski’s uncle were deemed the “person” to\nwhom the dealer “s[old]” the gun.1 But §922(b)(3) would\n——————\n  1 Sections 922(b)(5), (c), and (t)(1) require the dealer to follow certain\n\nprocedures with respect to that “person,” such as recording his name,\n4                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nunquestionably do so, since it prohibits a dealer from\nselling a gun to a person who resides in another State, as\nAbramski’s uncle did. That is of no moment, however,\nbecause Abramski’s uncle was not the “person” to whom\nthe gun was “s[old].”\n   The contrary interpretation provided by the Govern-\nment and the majority founders on the plain language of\nthe Act. We interpret criminal statutes, like other stat-\nutes, in a manner consistent with ordinary English usage.\nFlores-Figueroa v. United States, 556 U. S. 646, 650–652\n(2009); Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848, 855 (2000);\nBailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144–145 (1995). In\nordinary usage, a vendor sells (or delivers, or transfers) an\nitem of merchandise to the person who physically appears\nin his store, selects the item, pays for it, and takes posses-\nsion of it. So if I give my son $10 and tell him to pick up\nmilk and eggs at the store, no English speaker would say\nthat the store “sells” the milk and eggs to me.2 And even if\nwe were prepared to let “principles of agency law” trump\nordinary English usage in the interpretation of this crimi-\nnal statute, those principles would not require a different\n——————\ndealing with him in person, and checking his background. I doubt\nwhether a falsehood that causes the dealer to neglect those procedures\n(here, by applying them to the wrong person) is material to the lawful-\nness of the sale within the meaning of §922(a)(6) if the sale could have\nbeen executed lawfully had the truth been disclosed. Moreover, if that\nwere so—if a falsehood that introduced procedural error into a gun sale\nwere always material to lawfulness—then §924(a)(1)(A) (discussed in\nPart II of this opinion), which prohibits making false statements with\nrespect to information required to be recorded in a dealer’s records,\nwould be superfluous.\n  2 The majority makes the puzzling suggestion that the answer would\n\nbe different if the sale involved consumer electronics instead of grocer-\nies. Ante, at 9, n. 5. But whether the item sold is a carton of milk, an\niPhone, or anything else under the sun, an ordinary English speaker\nwould say that an over-the-counter merchant “sells” the item to the\nperson who pays for and takes possession of it, not the individual to\nwhom that person later transfers the item.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

[If there is fraud in the inducement and\nA has already paid], A can maintain an action against T\nfor the thousand dollars” (emphasis added)).\n    Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814 (1974), on\nwhich the majority relies, ante, at 14, does not suggest\notherwise. There we addressed the types of transactions\ncovered by the statutory term “acquisition” in §922(a)(6) (a\nterm whose meaning is not at issue here), holding that\nthey were not limited to “sale-like transaction[s]” but\nincluded a “pawnshop redemption of a firearm.” 415 U. S.,\nat 819. We said nothing about the distinct question of to\nwhom a dealer “sell[s],” “transfer[s],” or “deliver[s]” a\nfirearm in a given transaction. Nor does the case stand, as\nthe majority believes, for “a substance-over-form ap-\nproach,” ante, at 14. We said the term “acquisition” was\n“ ‘aimed at providing maximum coverage,’ ” ibid. (quoting\n415 U. S., at 826–827), not because substance over form\ndemands that, nor because everything in the Act must be\nassumed to provide maximum coverage, but because “[t]he\nword ‘acquire’ is defined to mean simply ‘to come into\npossession, control, or power of disposal of,’ ” which gives\n“no intimation . . . that title or ownership would be neces-\nsary.” Id., at 820.\n    Contrary to the majority’s assertion that the statute\n“merely raises, rather than answers, the critical question”\nof whether Abramski or his uncle was the “person” to\nwhom the dealer “s[old]” the gun, ante, at 9, the statute\nspeaks to that question directly. Giving the text its plain,\nordinary meaning, Abramski, not his uncle, was that\n“person.” That being so, the Government has identified no\nreason why the arrangement between Abramski and his\nuncle, both of whom were eligible to receive and possess\n6                  ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfirearms, was “material to the lawfulness of ” the sale.3\n                             B\n   The majority contends, however, that the Gun Control\nAct’s “principal purpose” of “curb[ing] crime by keeping\nfirearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to\npossess them” demands the conclusion that Abramski’s\nuncle was the “person” to whom the dealer “s[old]” the\ngun. Ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). But\n“no law pursues its purpose at all costs,” and the “textual\nlimitations upon a law’s scope” are equally “a part of its\n‘purpose.’ ” Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 752\n(2006) (plurality opinion). The majority’s purpose-based\narguments describe a statute Congress reasonably might\nhave written, but not the statute it wrote.\n   The heart of the majority’s argument is its claim that\nunless Abramski’s uncle is deemed the “person” to whom\nthe gun was “s[old],” the Act’s identification, background-\ncheck, and record-keeping requirements would be “ren-\nder[ed] meaningless.” Ante, at 11. That vastly overstates\nthe consequences. Perhaps the statute would serve the\npurpose of crime prevention more effectively if the re-\nquirements at issue looked past the “man at the counter”\nto the person “getting, and always meant to get, the fire-\n\n——————\n  3 The facts of this case provide no occasion to address whether—as\n\nATF maintained for many years before adopting its current position—a\nmisrepresentation in response to Form 4473’s “actual buyer/transferee”\nquestion would be “material to the lawfulness of the sale” if the cus-\ntomer intended to transfer the gun to a person who he knew or had\nreasonable cause to believe was prohibited by the Act from receiving or\npossessing firearms. A falsehood that conceals an intention of that sort\nmay be material because a dealer who sold the gun knowing of that\nintention might be “unlawfully aiding” the customer’s violation of\n§924(d) (and the prohibited person’s violation of §924(g)). Cf. ATF,\nIndustry Circular 79–10 (1979), in (Your Guide To) Federal Firearms\nRegulation 1988–89 (1988), p. 78; infra, at 10–11. I need not decide\nthat question here.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\narm.” Ante, at 13. But ensuring that the person taking\npossession of the firearm from the dealer is eligible to\nreceive and possess a firearm, and recording information\nabout that person for later reference, are by no means\nworthless functions. On the contrary, they indisputably\nadvance the purpose of crime prevention by making it\nharder for ineligible persons to acquire guns and easier for\nthe Government to locate those guns in the future; they\nsimply do not advance that purpose to the same degree as\na more exacting law might have done.\n   That the Act’s focus on the “man at the counter” in this\nsituation does not render its requirements “meaningless”\nis confirmed by the Government’s concession that the Act\nhas a similar focus in many comparable situations where\nthe gun’s immediate purchaser is—to use the majority’s\nphrase—a “mere condui[t]” for a contemplated transfer of\nthe gun to a different person who will “take possession of,\nown, and use” it. Ante, at 11, 16. Consider the following\nscenarios in which even the Government regards the man\nat the counter as the “person” to whom the dealer “sell[s]”\nthe gun:\n\n   \t Guns Intended as Gifts. In the Government’s view,\n      an individual who buys a gun “with the intent of\n      making a gift of the firearm to another person” is\n      the gun’s “true purchaser.” ATF, Federal Firearms\n      Regulations Reference Guide 165 (2005) (hereinaf-\n      ter 2005 ATF Guide). The Government’s position\n      makes no exception for situations where the gift is\n      specifically requested by the recipient (as gifts\n      sometimes are). So long as no money changes\n      hands, and no agency relationship is formed, be-\n      tween gifter and giftee, the Act is concerned only\n      with the man at the counter.\n\n   \t Guns Intended for Resale. Introducing money into\n8               ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n       the equation does not automatically change the\n       outcome. The Government admits that the man at\n       the counter is the true purchaser even if he imme-\n       diately sells the gun to someone else. Tr. of Oral\n       Arg. 34–35. And it appears the Government’s posi-\n       tion would be the same even if the man at the\n       counter purchased the gun with the intent to sell it\n       to a particular third party, so long as the two did\n       not enter into a common-law agency relationship.\n\n    \t Guns Intended as Raffle Prizes. The Government\n       considers the man at the counter the true pur-\n       chaser even if he is buying the gun “for the purpose\n       of raffling [it] at an event”—in which case he can\n       provide his own information on Form 4473 and\n       “transfer the firearm to the raffle winner without a\n       Form 4473 being completed or a [background]\n       check being conducted” on the winner. 2005 ATF\n       Guide 195.\n\nIf the statute’s requirements were “render[ed] meaning-\nless” by treating Abramski rather than his uncle as the\ntrue purchaser, then they would be every bit as meaning-\nless in the scenarios just described. The Government’s\nconcession that the statute is operating appropriately in\neach of those scenarios should cause the majority to\nreevaluate its assumptions about the type and degree of\nregulation that the statute regards as “meaningful.” The\nmajority, it is clear, regards Abramski’s interpretation as\ncreating a loophole in the law; but even if that were a fair\ncharacterization, why is the majority convinced that a\nstatute with so many admitted loopholes does not contain\nthis particular loophole?\n   The majority’s answer to this argument is that “the\nindividual who sends a straw to a gun store to buy a fire-\narm is transacting with the dealer, in every way but the\n                      Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     9\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmost formal.” Ante, at 16 (emphasis deleted). That cer-\ntainly distinguishes that individual from the intended\nsubsequent donee or purchaser; so would the fact that he\nhas orange hair. But it does not establish why that indi-\nvidual, any more than the others, should be thought to be\ncovered by statutory language (the “person” to whom\na dealer “sell[s]” a gun) that does not naturally apply.\nThe only thing which can justify that leap is the false\nimperative to make the statute as effective as possible,\nrather than as effective as the language indicates Con-\ngress desired.4\n  What the scenarios described above show is that the\nstatute typically is concerned only with the man at the\ncounter, even where that man is in a practical sense a\n“conduit” who will promptly transfer the gun to someone\nelse. Perhaps that is because Congress wanted a rule that\nwould be easy to understand and to administer, which the\nGovernment’s proposed agency test—and the majority’s\napparent adoption of that test sans any mention of agency\nlaw—certainly is not. (When counsel for the Government\nwas pressed about hypothetical situations not gift-\nwrapped as neatly as this case, he said, frankly but un-\nhelpfully, that they would turn on the “factual question” of\n“[w]hether the purchase was made on behalf of someone\n——————\n  4 The majority’s claim that its analysis “does not rest on mere ‘purpose-\n\nbased arguments,’ ” ante, at 9, n. 6, rings hollow. The majority\nsays it is relying on the principle that when a statutory provision is\n“ambiguous” but “only one of the permissible meanings produces a\nsubstantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law,” we\nshould adopt that meaning. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBut even if the text at issue here were ambiguous, it is clear that the\n“substantive effect” of the narrower interpretation is “compatible\nwith”—indeed, it is downright congenial to—“the rest of ” the Gun\nControl Act. The majority’s contrary conclusion rests, not on anything\nin the text or structure of the Act, but on the majority’s guess about\nhow far Congress meant to go in pursuit of its crime-prevention\n“purpose.”\n10              ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nelse.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 49–50.)\n   Or perhaps Congress drew the line where it did because\nthe Gun Control Act, like many contentious pieces of\nlegislation, was a “compromise” among “highly interested\nparties attempting to pull the provisions in different direc-\ntions.” Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 461\n(2002); see Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation\nPrograms v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co.,\n514 U. S. 122, 135–136 (1995). Perhaps those whose votes\nwere needed for passage of the statute wanted a lawful\npurchaser to be able to use an agent. A statute shaped by\npolitical tradeoffs in a controversial area may appear\n“imperfect” from some perspectives, but “our ability to\nimagine ways of redesigning the statute to advance one of\nCongress’ ends does not render it irrational.” Preseault v.\nICC, 494 U. S. 1, 19 (1990). We must accept that Con-\ngress, balancing the conflicting demands of a divided\ncitizenry, “ ‘wrote the statute it wrote’—meaning, a statute\ngoing so far and no further.” Michigan v. Bay Mills In-\ndian Community, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 11).\n   That Abramski’s reading does not render the Act’s\nrequirements “meaningless” is further evidenced by the\nfact that, for decades, even ATF itself did not read the\nstatute to criminalize conduct like Abramski’s. After\nCongress passed the Act in 1968, ATF’s initial position\nwas that the Act did not prohibit the sale of a gun to an\neligible buyer acting on behalf of a third party (even an\nineligible one). See Hearings Before the Subcommittee To\nInvestigate Juvenile Delinquency of the Senate Committee\non the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, 118 (1975).\nA few years later, ATF modified its position and asserted\nthat the Act did not “prohibit a dealer from making a sale\nto a person who is actually purchasing the firearm for\nanother person” unless the other person was “prohibited\nfrom receiving or possessing a firearm,” in which case the\ndealer could be guilty of “unlawfully aiding the prohibited\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nperson’s own violation.” ATF, Industry Circular 79–10\n(1979), in (Your Guide To) Federal Firearms Regulation\n1988–89 (1988), p. 78. The agency appears not to have\nadopted its current position until the early 1990’s. See\nUnited States v. Polk, 118 F. 3d 286, 295, n. 7 (CA5 1997).\n   The majority deems this enforcement history “not rel-\nevant” because the Government’s reading of a criminal\nstatute is not entitled to deference. Ante, at 22. But the\nfact that the agency charged with enforcing the Act read\nit, over a period of roughly 25 years, not to apply to the\ntype of conduct at issue here is powerful evidence that\ninterpreting the Act in that way is natural and reasonable\nand does not make its requirements “meaningless.”\n                              C\n    Even if the statute were wrongly thought to be ambigu-\nous on this point, the rule of lenity would defeat the Gov-\nernment’s construction. It is a “familiar principle” that\n“ ‘ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes\nshould be resolved in favor of lenity.’ ” Skilling v. United\nStates, 561 U. S. 358, 410 (2010). That principle prevents\nus from giving the words of a criminal statute “a meaning\nthat is different from [their] ordinary, accepted meaning,\nand that disfavors the defendant.” Burrage v. United\nStates, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12). And it\nmeans that when a criminal statute has two possible\nreadings, we do not “ ‘choose the harsher alternative’ ”\nunless Congress has “ ‘spoken in language that is clear and\ndefinite.’ ” United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347–349\n(1971). For the reasons given above, it cannot be said that\nthe statute unambiguously commands the Government’s\ncurrent reading. It is especially contrary to sound practice\nto give this criminal statute a meaning that the Govern-\nment itself rejected for years.\n    The majority does not mention the rule of lenity apart\nfrom a footnote, ante, at 18, n. 10, responding to this dis-\n12                 ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsent. The footnote concedes that “the text creates some\nambiguity” but says that “context, structure, history, and\npurpose resolve it.” Ibid. But for the reasons given above,\ncontext and structure do not support the majority’s inter-\npretation, history refutes it by showing that the Govern-\nment itself interpreted the statute more leniently for\nmany years, and “purpose” supports it only if one imputes\nto the statute a crime-fighting purpose broader than the\ntext discloses (a practice that would nullify the rule of\nlenity in all cases). See Part I–B, supra.5 If lenity has no\nrole to play in a clear case such as this one, we ought to\nstop pretending it is a genuine part of our jurisprudence.\n  Contrary to the majority’s miserly approach, the rule of\nlenity applies whenever, after all legitimate tools of inter-\npretation have been exhausted, “a reasonable doubt per-\nsists” regarding whether Congress has made the defend-\nant’s conduct a federal crime, Moskal v. United States, 498\nU. S. 103, 108 (1990)—in other words, whenever those\ntools do not decisively dispel the statute’s ambiguity.\nSkilling, supra, at 410; see, e.g., Scheidler v. National\nOrganization for Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 393, 409 (2003);\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000); Cran-\ndon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 158 (1990). “[W]here\ntext, structure, and history fail to establish that the Gov-\nernment’s position is unambiguously correct . . . we apply\nthe rule of lenity and resolve the ambiguity in [the de-\nfendant]’s favor.” United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S.\n39, 54 (1994). It cannot honestly be said that the text,\nstructure, and history of the Gun Control Act establish as\n“unambiguously correct” that the Act makes Abramski’s\nconduct a federal crime.\n  By refusing to apply lenity here, the majority turns its\n——————\n  5 The majority is thus entirely wrong to charge that I would apply the\n\nrule of lenity “because the statute’s text, taken alone, permits a nar-\nrower construction,” ante, at 18, n. 10.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nback on a liberty-protecting and democracy-promoting rule\nthat is “perhaps not much less old than construction it-\nself.” United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820)\n(Marshall, C. J.); see, e.g., 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\non the Laws of England 88 (1765) (“Penal statutes must be\nconstrued strictly”). As Chief Justice Marshall wrote, the\nrule is “founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights\nof individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of\npunishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial\ndepartment.” Wiltberger, supra, at 95. It forbids a court\nto criminalize an act simply because the court deems that\nact “of equal atrocity, or of kindred character, with those\nwhich are enumerated.” Id., at 96. Today’s majority\ndisregards that foundational principle.\n                   II. Section 924(a)(1)(A)\n   Under §924(a)(1)(A), it is a crime to make a “false\nstatement . . . with respect to the information required by\nthis chapter to be kept in the records of ” a federally li-\ncensed gun dealer (emphasis added). “[T]his chapter”\nrefers to chapter 44 of title 18 of the United States Code,\nwhich contains the Gun Control Act. §§921–931.\n   The question Abramski answered falsely was whether\nhe was buying the gun for someone else. Did the Act itself\nrequire the dealer to record this information? It did not; it\nsimply required him to record “the name, age, and place of\nresidence” of the “person” to whom the firearm was “s[old]\nor deliver[ed].” §922(b)(5). As explained above, that “per-\nson” was Abramski, not his uncle. See Part I, supra.\n   But, the majority says, the Act also directs dealers to\n“ ‘maintain such records . . . as the Attorney General may\nby regulations prescribe.’ ”        Ante, at 22 (quoting\n§923(g)(1)(A)). So did a regulation require this infor-\nmation to be recorded? Again, no. The relevant regulation\nprovides that a dealer shall\n    “obtain a Form 4473 from the transferee showing the\n14               ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n     transferee’s name, sex, residence address (including\n     county or similar political subdivision), date and place\n     of birth; height, weight and race of the transferee; the\n     transferee’s country of citizenship; the transferee’s\n     INS-issued alien number or admission number; the\n     transferee’s State of residence; and certification by the\n     transferee that the transferee is not prohibited by the\n     Act from transporting or shipping a firearm in inter-\n     state or foreign commerce or receiving a firearm\n     which has been shipped or transported in interstate or\n     foreign commerce or possessing a firearm in or affect-\n     ing commerce.” 27 CFR §478.124(c)(1) (2014).\nThe long list of information that this regulation requires\nto be kept in the dealer’s records does not include whether\nthe transferee is buying the gun for an eligible third party.\n   But wait! the majority says: Another provision of the\nregulation requires a dealer to “ ‘retain . . . as part of [its]\nrequired records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course\nof ’ ” selling or disposing of a firearm. Ante, at 23 (quoting\n27 CFR §478.124(a)). Therefore, according to the majority,\nany “false answer on that Form”—even an answer to a\nquestion that is not among those enumerated in the regu-\nlation—necessarily “pertains to information a dealer is\nstatutorily required to maintain.” Ante, at 23.\n   That carries the text of the statute a bridge too far. On\nthe majority’s view, if the bureaucrats responsible for\ncreating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer’s favor-\nite color, a false response would be a federal crime. That\nis not what the statute says. The statute punishes mis-\nstatements “with respect to information required to be\nkept,” §924(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added), not with respect to\n“information contained in forms required to be kept.”\nBecause neither the Act nor any regulation requires a\ndealer to keep a record of whether a customer is purchas-\ning a gun for himself or for an eligible third party, that\n                      Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     15\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nquestion had no place on Form 4473—any more than\nwould the question whether the customer was purchasing\nthe gun as a gift for a particular individual and, if so, who\nthat individual was. And the statute no more criminalizes\na false answer to an ultra vires question on Form 4473\nthan it criminalizes the purchaser’s volunteering of a false\ne-mail address on that form. Information regarding\nAbramski’s status as a “straw purchaser” was not “infor-\nmation required to be kept,” and that is an end of the\nmatter. In my view, that is the best—indeed, the only\nplausible—interpretation of §924(a)(1)(A). But at a mini-\nmum, the statute is ambiguous, and lenity does the rest.\nSee Part I–C, supra.6\n                        *     *    *\n  The Court makes it a federal crime for one lawful gun\nowner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner. Whether\nor not that is a sensible result, the statutes Congress\nenacted do not support it—especially when, as is appro-\npriate, we resolve ambiguity in those statutes in favor of\nthe accused. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  6 The  majority professes that it “need not, and do[es] not, opine on”\nwhether it would impose liability for “a false answer even to an ‘ultra\nvires question’ ” because, given its reasoning on Count One, the ques-\ntion at issue here was “part and parcel of the dealer’s determination of\nthe (true) buyer’s ‘name, age, and place of residence,’ which §922(b)(5)\nrequires the dealer to keep.” Ante, at 23, n. 11. But if that is really all\nthe majority means to decide, then why bother to invoke the require-\nment that the dealer keep such records as the regulations prescribe and\nthe regulation requiring the dealer to keep Form 4473? See ante, at\n22–23. If the majority’s ruling is as limited as it claims, it ought to cite\n§922(b)(5) and be done.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2678468/", "sha1": "3a5eccffa23e33ba9237d915a986dc37e7875889", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-061", "time_retrieved": "2014-06-16T08:00:49.381569"}
