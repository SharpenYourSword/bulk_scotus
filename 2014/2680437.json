Argued April 22, 2014—Decided June 25, 2014\nThe Copyright Act of 1976 gives a copyright owner the “exclusive\n  righ[t]” to “perform the copyrighted work publicly.” 17 U. S. C.\n  §106(4). The Act’s Transmit Clause defines that exclusive right to in-\n  clude the right to “transmit or otherwise communicate a performance\n  . . . of the [copyrighted] work . . . to the public, by means of any device\n  or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving\n  the performance . . . receive it in the same place or in separate places\n  and at the same time or at different times.” §101.\n      Respondent Aereo, Inc., sells a service that allows its subscribers to\n  watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time\n  as the programs are broadcast over the air. When a subscriber wants\n  to watch a show that is currently airing, he selects the show from a\n  menu on Aereo’s website. Aereo’s system, which consists of thou-\n  sands of small antennas and other equipment housed in a centralized\n  warehouse, responds roughly as follows: A server tunes an antenna,\n  which is dedicated to the use of one subscriber alone, to the broadcast\n  carrying the selected show. A transcoder translates the signals re-\n  ceived by the antenna into data that can be transmitted over the In-\n  ternet. A server saves the data in a subscriber-specific folder on\n  Aereo’s hard drive and begins streaming the show to the subscriber’s\n  screen once several seconds of programming have been saved. The\n  streaming continues, a few seconds behind the over-the-air broadcast,\n  until the subscriber has received the entire show.\n      Petitioners, who are television producers, marketers, distributors,\n  and broadcasters that own the copyrights in many of the programs\n  that Aereo streams, sued Aereo for copyright infringement. They\n  sought a preliminary injunction, arguing that Aereo was infringing\n2         AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    their right to “perform” their copyrighted works “publicly.” The Dis-\n    trict Court denied the preliminary injunction, and the Second Circuit\n    affirmed.\nHeld: Aereo performs petitioners’ works publicly within the meaning of\n the Transmit Clause. Pp. 4–18.\n    (a) Aereo “perform[s].” It does not merely supply equipment that\n allows others to do so. Pp. 4–10.\n      (1) One of Congress’ primary purposes in amending the Copy-\n right Act in 1976 was to overturn this Court’s holdings that the activ-\n ities of community antenna television (CATV) providers fell outside\n the Act’s scope. In Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television,\n Inc., 392 U. S. 390, the Court determined that a CATV provider was\n more like a viewer than a broadcaster, because its system “no more\n than enhances the viewer’s capacity to receive the broadcaster’s sig-\n nals [by] provid[ing] a well-located antenna with an efficient connec-\n tion to the viewer’s television set.” Id., at 399. Therefore, the Court\n concluded, a CATV provider did not perform publicly. The Court\n reached the same determination in respect to a CATV provider that\n retransmitted signals from hundreds of miles away in Teleprompter\n Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U. S. 394. “The re-\n ception and rechanneling of [broadcast television signals] for simul-\n taneous viewing is essentially a viewer function, irrespective of the\n distance between the broadcasting station and the ultimate viewer,”\n the Court said. Id., at 408. Pp. 4–7.\n      (2) In 1976, Congress amended the Copyright Act in large part to\n reject the Fortnightly and Teleprompter holdings. The Act now clari-\n fies that to “perform” an audiovisual work means “to show its images\n in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.”\n §101. Thus, both the broadcaster and the viewer “perform,” because\n they both show a television program’s images and make audible the\n program’s sounds. Congress also enacted the Transmit Clause,\n which specifies that an entity performs when it “transmit[s] . . . a\n performance . . . to the public.” Ibid. The Clause makes clear that an\n entity that acts like a CATV system itself performs, even when it\n simply enhances viewers’ ability to receive broadcast television sig-\n nals. Congress further created a complex licensing scheme that sets\n out the conditions, including the payment of compulsory fees, under\n which cable systems may retransmit broadcasts to the public. §111.\n Congress made all three of these changes to bring cable system activ-\n ities within the Copyright Act’s scope. Pp. 7–8.\n      (3) Because Aereo’s activities are substantially similar to those of\n the CATV companies that Congress amended the Act to reach, Aereo\n is not simply an equipment provider. Aereo sells a service that al-\n lows subscribers to watch television programs, many of which are\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncopyrighted, virtually as they are being broadcast. Aereo uses its\nown equipment, housed in a centralized warehouse, outside of its us-\ners’ homes. By means of its technology, Aereo’s system “receive[s]\nprograms that have been released to the public and carr[ies] them by\nprivate channels to additional viewers.” Fortnightly, supra, at 400.\n  This Court recognizes one particular difference between Aereo’s\nsystem and the cable systems at issue in Fortnightly and Teleprompt-\ner: The systems in those cases transmitted constantly, whereas\nAereo’s system remains inert until a subscriber indicates that she\nwants to watch a program. In other cases involving different kinds of\nservice or technology providers, a user’s involvement in the operation\nof the provider’s equipment and selection of the content transmitted\nmay well bear on whether the provider performs within the meaning\nof the Act. But given Aereo’s overwhelming likeness to the cable\ncompanies targeted by the 1976 amendments, this sole technological\ndifference between Aereo and traditional cable companies does not\nmake a critical difference here. Pp. 8–10.\n  (b) Aereo also performs petitioners’ works “publicly.” Under the\nClause, an entity performs a work publicly when it “transmit[s] . . . a\nperformance . . . of the work . . . to the public.” §101. What perfor-\nmance, if any, does Aereo transmit? Petitioners say Aereo transmits\na prior performance of their works, whereas Aereo says the perfor-\nmance it transmits is the new performance created by its act of\ntransmitting. This Court assumes arguendo that Aereo is correct and\nthus assumes, for present purposes, that to transmit a performance\nof an audiovisual work means to communicate contemporaneously\nvisible images and contemporaneously audible sounds of the work.\nUnder the Court’s assumed definition, Aereo transmits a perfor-\nmance whenever its subscribers watch a program.\n  What about the Clause’s further requirement that Aereo transmit\na performance “to the public”? Aereo claims that because it trans-\nmits from user-specific copies, using individually-assigned antennas,\nand because each transmission is available to only one subscriber, it\ndoes not transmit a performance “to the public.” Viewed in terms of\nCongress’ regulatory objectives, these behind-the-scenes technological\ndifferences do not distinguish Aereo’s system from cable systems,\nwhich do perform publicly. Congress would as much have intended to\nprotect a copyright holder from the unlicensed activities of Aereo as\nfrom those of cable companies.\n  The text of the Clause effectuates Congress’ intent. Under the\nClause, an entity may transmit a performance through multiple\ntransmissions, where the performance is of the same work. Thus\nwhen an entity communicates the same contemporaneously percepti-\nble images and sounds to multiple people, it “transmit[s] . . . a per-\n4         AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    formance” to them, irrespective of the number of discrete communica-\n    tions it makes and irrespective of whether it transmits using a single\n    copy of the work or, as Aereo does, using an individual personal copy\n    for each viewer.\n       Moreover, the subscribers to whom Aereo transmits constitute “the\n    public” under the Act. This is because Aereo communicates the same\n    contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to a large number\n    of people who are unrelated and unknown to each other. In addition,\n    neither the record nor Aereo suggests that Aereo’s subscribers receive\n    performances in their capacities as owners or possessors of the under-\n    lying works. This is relevant because when an entity performs to a\n    set of people, whether they constitute “the public” often depends upon\n    their relationship to the underlying work. Finally, the statute makes\n    clear that the fact that Aereo’s subscribers may receive the same pro-\n    grams at different times and locations is of no consequence. Aereo\n    transmits a performance of petitioners’ works “to the public.” Pp. 11–\n    15.\n       (c) Given the limited nature of this holding, the Court does not be-\n    lieve its decision will discourage the emergence or use of different\n    kinds of technologies.

S. C. §106(4). The Act’s Transmit Clause\ndefines that exclusive right as including the right to\n    “transmit or otherwise communicate a performance\n    . . . of the [copyrighted] work . . . to the public, by\n    means of any device or process, whether the members\n    of the public capable of receiving the performance . . .\n    receive it in the same place or in separate places and\n    at the same time or at different times.” §101.\nWe must decide whether respondent Aereo, Inc., infringes\nthis exclusive right by selling its subscribers a technologi-\ncally complex service that allows them to watch television\nprograms over the Internet at about the same time as the\nprograms are broadcast over the air. We conclude that it\ndoes.\n2      AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   For a monthly fee, Aereo offers subscribers broadcast\ntelevision programming over the Internet, virtually as the\nprogramming is being broadcast. Much of this program-\nming is made up of copyrighted works. Aereo neither\nowns the copyright in those works nor holds a license from\nthe copyright owners to perform those works publicly.\n   Aereo’s system is made up of servers, transcoders, and\nthousands of dime-sized antennas housed in a central\nwarehouse. It works roughly as follows: First, when a\nsubscriber wants to watch a show that is currently being\nbroadcast, he visits Aereo’s website and selects, from a list\nof the local programming, the show he wishes to see.\n   Second, one of Aereo’s servers selects an antenna, which\nit dedicates to the use of that subscriber (and that sub-\nscriber alone) for the duration of the selected show. A\nserver then tunes the antenna to the over-the-air broad-\ncast carrying the show. The antenna begins to receive the\nbroadcast, and an Aereo transcoder translates the sig-\nnals received into data that can be transmitted over the\nInternet.\n   Third, rather than directly send the data to the sub-\nscriber, a server saves the data in a subscriber-specific\nfolder on Aereo’s hard drive. In other words, Aereo’s\nsystem creates a subscriber-specific copy—that is, a “per-\nsonal” copy—of the subscriber’s program of choice.\n   Fourth, once several seconds of programming have been\nsaved, Aereo’s server begins to stream the saved copy of\nthe show to the subscriber over the Internet. (The sub-\nscriber may instead direct Aereo to stream the program at\na later time, but that aspect of Aereo’s service is not before\nus.) The subscriber can watch the streamed program on\nthe screen of his personal computer, tablet, smart phone,\nInternet-connected television, or other Internet-connected\ndevice. The streaming continues, a mere few seconds\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbehind the over-the-air broadcast, until the subscriber has\nreceived the entire show. See A Dictionary of Computing\n494 (6th ed. 2008) (defining “streaming” as “[t]he process\nof providing a steady flow of audio or video data so that an\nInternet user is able to access it as it is transmitted”).\n   Aereo emphasizes that the data that its system streams\nto each subscriber are the data from his own personal\ncopy, made from the broadcast signals received by the\nparticular antenna allotted to him. Its system does not\ntransmit data saved in one subscriber’s folder to any other\nsubscriber. When two subscribers wish to watch the same\nprogram, Aereo’s system activates two separate antennas\nand saves two separate copies of the program in two sepa-\nrate folders. It then streams the show to the subscribers\nthrough two separate transmissions—each from the sub-\nscriber’s personal copy.\n                              B\n   Petitioners are television producers, marketers, distrib-\nutors, and broadcasters who own the copyrights in many\nof the programs that Aereo’s system streams to its sub-\nscribers. They brought suit against Aereo for copyright\ninfringement in Federal District Court. They sought a\npreliminary injunction, arguing that Aereo was infringing\ntheir right to “perform” their works “publicly,” as the\nTransmit Clause defines those terms.\n   The District Court denied the preliminary injunction.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In the Second Circuit’s\nview, Aereo does not perform publicly within the meaning\nof the Transmit Clause because it does not transmit “to\nthe public.” Rather, each time Aereo streams a program to\na subscriber, it sends a private transmission that is avail-\n4      AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v.

Aereo, Inc., 722 F. 3d 500 (2013). We granted\ncertiorari.\n                              II\n   This case requires us to answer two questions: First, in\noperating in the manner described above, does Aereo\n“perform” at all? And second, if so, does Aereo do so “pub-\nlicly”? We address these distinct questions in turn.\n   Does Aereo “perform”? See §106(4) (“[T]he owner of [a]\ncopyright . . . has the exclusive righ[t] . . . to perform the\ncopyrighted work publicly” (emphasis added)); §101 (“To\nperform . . . a work ‘publicly’ means [among other things]\nto transmit . . . a performance . . . of the work . . . to the\npublic . . . ” (emphasis added)). Phrased another way, does\nAereo “transmit . . . a performance” when a subscriber\nwatches a show using Aereo’s system, or is it only the\nsubscriber who transmits? In Aereo’s view, it does not\nperform. It does no more than supply equipment that\n“emulate[s] the operation of a home antenna and [digital\nvideo recorder (DVR)].” Brief for Respondent 41. Like a\nhome antenna and DVR, Aereo’s equipment simply re-\nsponds to its subscribers’ directives. So it is only the\nsubscribers who “perform” when they use Aereo’s equip-\nment to stream television programs to themselves.\n   Considered alone, the language of the Act does not\nclearly indicate when an entity “perform[s]” (or “trans-\nmit[s]”) and when it merely supplies equipment that\nallows others to do so. But when read in light of its pur-\npose, the Act is unmistakable: An entity that engages in\nactivities like Aereo’s performs.\n                         A\n  History makes plain that one of Congress’ primary\npurposes in amending the Copyright Act in 1976 was to\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noverturn this Court’s determination that community\nantenna television (CATV) systems (the precursors of\nmodern cable systems) fell outside the Act’s scope. In\nFortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392\nU. S. 390 (1968), the Court considered a CATV system\nthat carried local television broadcasting, much of which\nwas copyrighted, to its subscribers in two cities. The\nCATV provider placed antennas on hills above the cities\nand used coaxial cables to carry the signals received by the\nantennas to the home television sets of its subscribers.\nThe system amplified and modulated the signals in order\nto improve their strength and efficiently transmit them to\nsubscribers. A subscriber “could choose any of the . . .\nprograms he wished to view by simply turning the knob on\nhis own television set.” Id., at 392. The CATV provider\n“neither edited the programs received nor originated any\nprograms of its own.” Ibid.\n    Asked to decide whether the CATV provider infringed\ncopyright holders’ exclusive right to perform their works\npublicly, the Court held that the provider did not “per-\nform” at all. See 17 U. S. C. §1(c) (1964 ed.) (granting\ncopyright holder the exclusive right to “perform . . . in\npublic for profit” a nondramatic literary work), §1(d)\n(granting copyright holder the exclusive right to “perform\n. . . publicly” a dramatic work). The Court drew a line:\n“Broadcasters perform. Viewers do not perform.” 392\nU. S., at 398 (footnote omitted). And a CATV provider\n“falls on the viewer’s side of the line.” Id., at 399.\n    The Court reasoned that CATV providers were unlike\nbroadcasters:\n    “Broadcasters select the programs to be viewed; CATV\n    systems simply carry, without editing, whatever pro-\n    grams they receive. Broadcasters procure programs\n    and propagate them to the public; CATV systems re-\n    ceive programs that have been released to the public\n6      AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    and carry them by private channels to additional\n    viewers.” Id., at 400.\nInstead, CATV providers were more like viewers, for “the\nbasic function [their] equipment serves is little different\nfrom that served by the equipment generally furnished by”\nviewers. Id., at 399. “Essentially,” the Court said, “a\nCATV system no more than enhances the viewer’s capac-\nity to receive the broadcaster’s signals [by] provid[ing] a\nwell-located antenna with an efficient connection to the\nviewer’s television set.” Ibid. Viewers do not become\nperformers by using “amplifying equipment,” and a CATV\nprovider should not be treated differently for providing\nviewers the same equipment. Id., at 398–400.\n   In Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys-\ntem, Inc., 415 U. S. 394 (1974), the Court considered the\ncopyright liability of a CATV provider that carried broad-\ncast television programming into subscribers’ homes from\nhundreds of miles away. Although the Court recognized\nthat a viewer might not be able to afford amplifying\nequipment that would provide access to those distant\nsignals, it nonetheless found that the CATV provider was\nmore like a viewer than a broadcaster. Id., at 408–409. It\nexplained: “The reception and rechanneling of [broadcast\ntelevision signals] for simultaneous viewing is essentially\na viewer function, irrespective of the distance between the\nbroadcasting station and the ultimate viewer.” Id., at 408.\n   The Court also recognized that the CATV system exer-\ncised some measure of choice over what to transmit. But\nthat fact did not transform the CATV system into a broad-\ncaster. A broadcaster exercises significant creativity in\nchoosing what to air, the Court reasoned. Id., at 410. In\ncontrast, the CATV provider makes an initial choice about\nwhich broadcast stations to retransmit, but then “ ‘simply\ncarr[ies], without editing, whatever programs [it] re-\nceive[s].’ ” Ibid.

See H. R. Rep. No. 94–1476, pp. 86–87\n(1976) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (The 1976 amendments\n“completely overturned” this Court’s narrow construction\nof the Act in Fortnightly and Teleprompter). Congress\nenacted new language that erased the Court’s line be-\ntween broadcaster and viewer, in respect to “perform[ing]”\na work. The amended statute clarifies that to “perform”\nan audiovisual work means “to show its images in any\nsequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.”\n§101; see ibid. (defining “[a]udiovisual works” as “works\nthat consist of a series of related images which are intrin-\nsically intended to be shown by the use of machines . . . ,\ntogether with accompanying sounds”). Under this new\nlanguage, both the broadcaster and the viewer of a televi-\nsion program “perform,” because they both show the pro-\ngram’s images and make audible the program’s sounds.\nSee H. R. Rep., at 63 (“[A] broadcasting network is per-\nforming when it transmits [a singer’s performance of a\nsong] . . . and any individual is performing whenever he or\nshe . . . communicates the performance by turning on a\nreceiving set”).\n   Congress also enacted the Transmit Clause, which\nspecifies that an entity performs publicly when it “trans-\nmit[s] . . . a performance . . . to the public.” §101; see ibid.\n(defining “[t]o ‘transmit’ a performance” as “to communi-\ncate it by any device or process whereby images or sounds\nare received beyond the place from which they are sent”).\nCable system activities, like those of the CATV systems in\nFortnightly and Teleprompter, lie at the heart of the activ-\nities that Congress intended this language to cover.

(“[T]he concep[t] of public perfor-\nmance . . . cover[s] not only the initial rendition or show-\ning, but also any further act by which that rendition or\nshowing is transmitted or communicated to the public”).\nThe Clause thus makes clear that an entity that acts like\na CATV system itself performs, even if when doing so, it\nsimply enhances viewers’ ability to receive broadcast\ntelevision signals.\n  Congress further created a new section of the Act to\nregulate cable companies’ public performances of copy-\nrighted works. See §111. Section 111 creates a complex,\nhighly detailed compulsory licensing scheme that sets out\nthe conditions, including the payment of compulsory fees,\nunder which cable systems may retransmit broadcasts.\nH. R. Rep., at 88 (Section 111 is primarily “directed at the\noperation of cable television systems and the terms and\nconditions of their liability for the retransmission of copy-\nrighted works”).\n  Congress made these three changes to achieve a similar\nend: to bring the activities of cable systems within the\nscope of the Copyright Act.\n                              C\n   This history makes clear that Aereo is not simply an\nequipment provider. Rather, Aereo, and not just its sub-\nscribers, “perform[s]” (or “transmit[s]”). Aereo’s activities\nare substantially similar to those of the CATV companies\nthat Congress amended the Act to reach. See id., at 89\n(“[C]able systems are commercial enterprises whose basic\nretransmission operations are based on the carriage of\ncopyrighted program material”). Aereo sells a service that\nallows subscribers to watch television programs, many of\nwhich are copyrighted, almost as they are being broadcast.\nIn providing this service, Aereo uses its own equipment,\nhoused in a centralized warehouse, outside of its users’\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhomes. By means of its technology (antennas, trans-\ncoders, and servers), Aereo’s system “receive[s] programs\nthat have been released to the public and carr[ies] them by\nprivate channels to additional viewers.” Fortnightly, 392\nU. S., at 400. It “carr[ies] . . . whatever programs [it]\nreceive[s],” and it offers “all the programming” of each\nover-the-air station it carries. Id., at 392, 400.\n  Aereo’s equipment may serve a “viewer function”; it may\nenhance the viewer’s ability to receive a broadcaster’s\nprograms. It may even emulate equipment a viewer could\nuse at home. But the same was true of the equipment that\nwas before the Court, and ultimately before Congress, in\nFortnightly and Teleprompter.\n   We recognize, and Aereo and the dissent emphasize,\none particular difference between Aereo’s system and the\ncable systems at issue in Fortnightly and Teleprompter.\nThe systems in those cases transmitted constantly; they\nsent continuous programming to each subscriber’s televi-\nsion set. In contrast, Aereo’s system remains inert until a\nsubscriber indicates that she wants to watch a program.\nOnly at that moment, in automatic response to the sub-\nscriber’s request, does Aereo’s system activate an antenna\nand begin to transmit the requested program.\n  This is a critical difference, says the dissent. It means\nthat Aereo’s subscribers, not Aereo, “selec[t] the copy-\nrighted content” that is “perform[ed],” post, at 4 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.), and for that reason they, not Aereo, “transmit”\nthe performance. Aereo is thus like “a copy shop that\nprovides its patrons with a library card.” Post, at 5. A\ncopy shop is not directly liable whenever a patron uses the\nshop’s machines to “reproduce” copyrighted materials\nfound in that library. See §106(1) (“exclusive righ[t] . . . to\nreproduce the copyrighted work”). And by the same token,\nAereo should not be directly liable whenever its patrons\nuse its equipment to “transmit” copyrighted television\nprograms to their screens.\n10     AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In our view, however, the dissent’s copy shop argument,\nin whatever form, makes too much out of too little. Given\nAereo’s overwhelming likeness to the cable companies\ntargeted by the 1976 amendments, this sole technological\ndifference between Aereo and traditional cable companies\ndoes not make a critical difference here. The subscribers\nof the Fortnightly and Teleprompter cable systems also\nselected what programs to display on their receiving sets.\nIndeed, as we explained in Fortnightly, such a subscriber\n“could choose any of the . . . programs he wished to view by\nsimply turning the knob on his own television set.” 392\nU. S., at 392. The same is true of an Aereo subscriber. Of\ncourse, in Fortnightly the television signals, in a sense,\nlurked behind the screen, ready to emerge when the sub-\nscriber turned the knob. Here the signals pursue their\nordinary course of travel through the universe until to-\nday’s “turn of the knob”—a click on a website—activates\nmachinery that intercepts and reroutes them to Aereo’s\nsubscribers over the Internet. But this difference means\nnothing to the subscriber. It means nothing to the broad-\ncaster. We do not see how this single difference, invisible\nto subscriber and broadcaster alike, could transform a\nsystem that is for all practical purposes a traditional cable\nsystem into “a copy shop that provides its patrons with a\nlibrary card.”\n   In other cases involving different kinds of service or\ntechnology providers, a user’s involvement in the opera-\ntion of the provider’s equipment and selection of the con-\ntent transmitted may well bear on whether the provider\nperforms within the meaning of the Act. But the many\nsimilarities between Aereo and cable companies, consid-\nered in light of Congress’ basic purposes in amending the\nCopyright Act, convince us that this difference is not\ncritical here. We conclude that Aereo is not just an\nequipment supplier and that Aereo “perform[s].”\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014) \n          11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              III\n\n   Next, we must consider whether Aereo performs peti-\ntioners’ works “publicly,” within the meaning of the\nTransmit Clause. Under the Clause, an entity performs a\nwork publicly when it “transmit[s] . . . a performance . . . of\nthe work . . . to the public.” §101. Aereo denies that it\nsatisfies this definition. It reasons as follows: First, the\n“performance” it “transmit[s]” is the performance created\nby its act of transmitting. And second, because each of\nthese performances is capable of being received by one and\nonly one subscriber, Aereo transmits privately, not pub-\nlicly. Even assuming Aereo’s first argument is correct, its\nsecond does not follow.\n   We begin with Aereo’s first argument. What perfor-\nmance does Aereo transmit? Under the Act, “[t]o ‘trans-\nmit’ a performance . . . is to communicate it by any device\nor process whereby images or sounds are received beyond\nthe place from which they are sent.” Ibid. And “[t]o ‘per-\nform’ ” an audiovisual work means “to show its images in\nany sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it\naudible.” Ibid.\n   Petitioners say Aereo transmits a prior performance of\ntheir works. Thus when Aereo retransmits a network’s\nprior broadcast, the underlying broadcast (itself a perfor-\nmance) is the performance that Aereo transmits. Aereo,\nas discussed above, says the performance it transmits is\nthe new performance created by its act of transmitting.\nThat performance comes into existence when Aereo\nstreams the sounds and images of a broadcast program to\na subscriber’s screen.\n   We assume arguendo that Aereo’s first argument is\ncorrect. Thus, for present purposes, to transmit a perfor-\nmance of (at least) an audiovisual work means to com-\nmunicate contemporaneously visible images and contem-\nporaneously audible sounds of the work. Cf. United States\nv. American Soc. of Composers, Authors and Publishers,\n12     AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n627 F. 3d 64, 73 (CA2 2010) (holding that a download of a\nwork is not a performance because the data transmitted\nare not “contemporaneously perceptible”). When an Aereo\nsubscriber selects a program to watch, Aereo streams the\nprogram over the Internet to that subscriber. Aereo\nthereby “communicate[s]” to the subscriber, by means of a\n“device or process,” the work’s images and sounds. §101.\nAnd those images and sounds are contemporaneously\nvisible and audible on the subscriber’s computer (or other\nInternet-connected device). So under our assumed defini-\ntion, Aereo transmits a performance whenever its sub-\nscribers watch a program.\n   But what about the Clause’s further requirement that\nAereo transmit a performance “to the public”? As we have\nsaid, an Aereo subscriber receives broadcast television\nsignals with an antenna dedicated to him alone. Aereo’s\nsystem makes from those signals a personal copy of the\nselected program. It streams the content of the copy to the\nsame subscriber and to no one else. One and only one\nsubscriber has the ability to see and hear each Aereo\ntransmission. The fact that each transmission is to only\none subscriber, in Aereo’s view, means that it does not\ntransmit a performance “to the public.”\n   In terms of the Act’s purposes, these differences do not\ndistinguish Aereo’s system from cable systems, which do\nperform “publicly.” Viewed in terms of Congress’ regula-\ntory objectives, why should any of these technological differ-\nences matter? They concern the behind-the-scenes way in\nwhich Aereo delivers television programming to its view-\ners’ screens. They do not render Aereo’s commercial objec-\ntive any different from that of cable companies. Nor do\nthey significantly alter the viewing experience of Aereo’s\nsubscribers. Why would a subscriber who wishes to watch\na television show care much whether images and sounds\nare delivered to his screen via a large multisubscriber\nantenna or one small dedicated antenna, whether they\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\narrive instantaneously or after a few seconds’ delay, or\nwhether they are transmitted directly or after a personal\ncopy is made? And why, if Aereo is right, could not mod-\nern CATV systems simply continue the same commercial\nand consumer-oriented activities, free of copyright re-\nstrictions, provided they substitute such new technologies\nfor old? Congress would as much have intended to protect\na copyright holder from the unlicensed activities of Aereo\nas from those of cable companies.\n  The text of the Clause effectuates Congress’ intent.\nAereo’s argument to the contrary relies on the premise\nthat “to transmit . . . a performance” means to make a\nsingle transmission. But the Clause suggests that an\nentity may transmit a performance through multiple,\ndiscrete transmissions. That is because one can “trans-\nmit” or “communicate” something through a set of actions.\nThus one can transmit a message to one’s friends, irre-\nspective of whether one sends separate identical e-mails to\neach friend or a single e-mail to all at once. So can an\nelected official communicate an idea, slogan, or speech to\nher constituents, regardless of whether she communicates\nthat idea, slogan, or speech during individual phone calls\nto each constituent or in a public square.\n  The fact that a singular noun (“a performance”) follows\nthe words “to transmit” does not suggest the contrary.\nOne can sing a song to his family, whether he sings the\nsame song one-on-one or in front of all together. Similarly,\none’s colleagues may watch a performance of a particular\nplay—say, this season’s modern-dress version of “Measure\nfor Measure”—whether they do so at separate or at the\nsame showings. By the same principle, an entity may\ntransmit a performance through one or several transmis-\nsions, where the performance is of the same work.\n  The Transmit Clause must permit this interpretation,\nfor it provides that one may transmit a performance to the\npublic “whether the members of the public capable of\n14     AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreceiving the performance . . . receive it . . . at the same\ntime or at different times.” §101. Were the words “to\ntransmit . . . a performance” limited to a single act of\ncommunication, members of the public could not receive\nthe performance communicated “at different times.”\nTherefore, in light of the purpose and text of the Clause,\nwe conclude that when an entity communicates the same\ncontemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to\nmultiple people, it transmits a performance to them re-\ngardless of the number of discrete communications it\nmakes.\n   We do not see how the fact that Aereo transmits via\npersonal copies of programs could make a difference. The\nAct applies to transmissions “by means of any device or\nprocess.” Ibid. And retransmitting a television program\nusing user-specific copies is a “process” of transmitting a\nperformance. A “cop[y]” of a work is simply a “material\nobjec[t] . . . in which a work is fixed . . . and from which the\nwork can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communi-\ncated.” Ibid. So whether Aereo transmits from the same\nor separate copies, it performs the same work; it shows the\nsame images and makes audible the same sounds. There-\nfore, when Aereo streams the same television program to\nmultiple subscribers, it “transmit[s] . . . a performance” to\nall of them.\n   Moreover, the subscribers to whom Aereo transmits\ntelevision programs constitute “the public.” Aereo com-\nmunicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images\nand sounds to a large number of people who are unre-\nlated and unknown to each other. This matters because,\nalthough the Act does not define “the public,” it specifies\nthat an entity performs publicly when it performs at “any\nplace where a substantial number of persons outside of a\nnormal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is\ngathered.” Ibid. The Act thereby suggests that “the pub-\nlic” consists of a large group of people outside of a family\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand friends.\n   Neither the record nor Aereo suggests that Aereo’s\nsubscribers receive performances in their capacities as\nowners or possessors of the underlying works. This is\nrelevant because when an entity performs to a set of peo-\nple, whether they constitute “the public” often depends\nupon their relationship to the underlying work. When, for\nexample, a valet parking attendant returns cars to their\ndrivers, we would not say that the parking service pro-\nvides cars “to the public.” We would say that it provides\nthe cars to their owners. We would say that a car dealer-\nship, on the other hand, does provide cars to the public, for\nit sells cars to individuals who lack a pre-existing relation-\nship to the cars. Similarly, an entity that transmits a\nperformance to individuals in their capacities as owners or\npossessors does not perform to “the public,” whereas an\nentity like Aereo that transmits to large numbers of pay-\ning subscribers who lack any prior relationship to the\nworks does so perform.\n   Finally, we note that Aereo’s subscribers may receive\nthe same programs at different times and locations. This\nfact does not help Aereo, however, for the Transmit Clause\nexpressly provides that an entity may perform publicly\n“whether the members of the public capable of receiving\nthe performance . . . receive it in the same place or in\nseparate places and at the same time or at different\ntimes.” Ibid. In other words, “the public” need not be\nsituated together, spatially or temporally. For these\nreasons, we conclude that Aereo transmits a performance\nof petitioners’ copyrighted works to the public, within the\nmeaning of the Transmit Clause.\n                           IV\n  Aereo and many of its supporting amici argue that to\napply the Transmit Clause to Aereo’s conduct will impose\ncopyright liability on other technologies, including new\n16     AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntechnologies, that Congress could not possibly have wanted\nto reach. We agree that Congress, while intending the\nTransmit Clause to apply broadly to cable companies and\ntheir equivalents, did not intend to discourage or to control\nthe emergence or use of different kinds of technologies.\nBut we do not believe that our limited holding today will\nhave that effect.\n   For one thing, the history of cable broadcast transmis-\nsions that led to the enactment of the Transmit Clause\ninforms our conclusion that Aereo “perform[s],” but it does\nnot determine whether different kinds of providers in\ndifferent contexts also “perform.” For another, an entity\nonly transmits a performance when it communicates\ncontemporaneously perceptible images and sounds of a\nwork. See Brief for Respondent 31 (“[I]f a distributor . . .\nsells [multiple copies of a digital video disc] by mail to\nconsumers, . . . [its] distribution of the DVDs merely\nmakes it possible for the recipients to perform the work\nthemselves—it is not a ‘device or process’ by which the\ndistributor publicly performs the work” (emphasis in\noriginal)).\n   Further, we have interpreted the term “the public” to\napply to a group of individuals acting as ordinary mem-\nbers of the public who pay primarily to watch broadcast\ntelevision programs, many of which are copyrighted. We\nhave said that it does not extend to those who act as own-\ners or possessors of the relevant product. And we have not\nconsidered whether the public performance right is in-\nfringed when the user of a service pays primarily for\nsomething other than the transmission of copyrighted\nworks, such as the remote storage of content. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 31 (distinguishing cloud-\nbased storage services because they “offer consumers more\nnumerous and convenient means of playing back copies\nthat the consumers have already lawfully acquired” (em-\nphasis in original)). In addition, an entity does not trans-\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Universal City Studios, Inc.,\n464 U. S. 417 (1984).\n  We cannot now answer more precisely how the Transmit\nClause or other provisions of the Copyright Act will apply\nto technologies not before us. We agree with the Solicitor\nGeneral that “[q]uestions involving cloud computing,\n[remote storage] DVRs, and other novel issues not before\nthe Court, as to which ‘Congress has not plainly marked\n[the] course,’ should await a case in which they are\nsquarely presented.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 34 (quoting Sony, supra, at 431 (alteration in\noriginal)). And we note that, to the extent commercial\nactors or other interested entities may be concerned with\nthe relationship between the development and use of such\ntechnologies and the Copyright Act, they are of course free\nto seek action from Congress. Cf. Digital Millennium\nCopyright Act, 17 U. S. C. §512.\n                         *     *   *\n   In sum, having considered the details of Aereo’s practices,\nwe find them highly similar to those of the CATV systems\nin Fortnightly and Teleprompter. And those are activities\nthat the 1976 amendments sought to bring within the\nscope of the Copyright Act. Insofar as there are differ-\nences, those differences concern not the nature of the\nservice that Aereo provides so much as the technological\nmanner in which it provides the service. We conclude that\nthose differences are not adequate to place Aereo’s activi-\nties outside the scope of the Act.\n   For these reasons, we conclude that Aereo “perform[s]”\n18     AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners’ copyrighted works “publicly,” as those terms\nare defined by the Transmit Clause.

Petitioners, a collection of television networks and\naffiliates (Networks), broadcast copyrighted programs on\nthe public airwaves for all to see. Aereo, respondent,\noperates an automated system that allows subscribers to\nreceive, on Internet-connected devices, programs that they\nselect, including the Networks’ copyrighted programs.\nThe Networks sued Aereo for several forms of copyright\ninfringement, but we are here concerned with a single\nclaim: that Aereo violates the Networks’ “exclusive righ[t]”\nto “perform” their programs “publicly.”         17 U. S. C.\n§106(4). That claim fails at the very outset because Aereo\ndoes not “perform” at all. The Court manages to reach the\nopposite conclusion only by disregarding widely accepted\nrules for service-provider liability and adopting in their\nplace an improvised standard (“looks-like-cable-TV”) that\nwill sow confusion for years to come.\n                   I. Legal Standard\n There are two types of liability for copyright infringe-\nment: direct and secondary. As its name suggests, the\n2      AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nformer applies when an actor personally engages in in-\nfringing conduct. See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal\nCity Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, 433 (1984). Secondary\nliability, by contrast, is a means of holding defendants\nresponsible for infringement by third parties, even when\nthe defendants “have not themselves engaged in the in-\nfringing activity.” Id., at 435. It applies when a defendant\n“intentionally induc[es] or encourag[es]” infringing acts by\nothers or profits from such acts “while declining to exer-\ncise a right to stop or limit [them].” Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\nStudios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U. S. 913, 930 (2005).\n   Most suits against equipment manufacturers and ser-\nvice providers involve secondary-liability claims. For ex-\nample, when movie studios sued to block the sale of\nSony’s Betamax videocassette recorder (VCR), they argued\nthat Sony was liable because its customers were making\nunauthorized copies. See Sony, supra, at 434–435. Record\nlabels and movie studios relied on a similar theory when\nthey sued Grokster and StreamCast, two providers of\npeer-to-peer file-sharing software. See Grokster, supra, at\n920–921, 927.\n   This suit, or rather the portion of it before us here, is\nfundamentally different. The Networks claim that Aereo\ndirectly infringes their public-performance right. Accord-\ningly, the Networks must prove that Aereo “perform[s]”\ncopyrighted works, §106(4), when its subscribers log in,\nselect a channel, and push the “watch” button. That pro-\ncess undoubtedly results in a performance; the question is\nwho does the performing. See Cartoon Network LP, LLLP\nv. CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F. 3d 121, 130 (CA2 2008). If\nAereo’s subscribers perform but Aereo does not, the claim\nnecessarily fails.\n   The Networks’ claim is governed by a simple but pro-\nfoundly important rule: A defendant may be held directly\nliable only if it has engaged in volitional conduct that\nviolates the Act. See 3 W. Patry, Copyright §9:5.50 (2013).\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   3\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nThis requirement is firmly grounded in the Act’s text,\nwhich defines “perform” in active, affirmative terms: One\n“perform[s]” a copyrighted “audiovisual work,” such as a\nmovie or news broadcast, by “show[ing] its images in any\nsequence” or “mak[ing] the sounds accompanying it audi-\nble.” §101. And since the Act makes it unlawful to copy or\nperform copyrighted works, not to copy or perform in\ngeneral, see §501(a), the volitional-act requirement de-\nmands conduct directed to the plaintiff ’s copyrighted\nmaterial, see Sony, supra, at 434. Every Court of Appeals\nto have considered an automated-service provider’s direct\nliability for copyright infringement has adopted that rule.\nSee Fox Broadcasting Co. v. Dish Network LLC, 747 F. 3d\n1060, 1066–1068 (CA9 2014); Cartoon Network, supra, at\n130–131 (CA2 2008); CoStar Group, Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc.,\n373 F. 3d 544, 549–550 (CA4 2004).1 Although we have\nnot opined on the issue, our cases are fully consistent with\na volitional-conduct requirement. For example, we gave\nseveral examples of direct infringement in Sony, each of\nwhich involved a volitional act directed to the plaintiff ’s\ncopyrighted material. See 464 U. S., at 437, n. 18.\n   The volitional-conduct requirement is not at issue in\nmost direct-infringement cases; the usual point of dispute\nis whether the defendant’s conduct is infringing (e.g., Does\nthe defendant’s design copy the plaintiff ’s?), rather than\nwhether the defendant has acted at all (e.g., Did this\ndefendant create the infringing design?). But it comes\nright to the fore when a direct-infringement claim is\n——————\n  1 An unpublished decision of the Third Circuit is to the same effect.\nParker v. Google, Inc., 242 Fed.

Internet-service providers are a prime example.\nWhen one user sends data to another, the provider’s\nequipment facilitates the transfer automatically.

The provid-\ner’s system is “totally indifferent to the material’s con-\ntent,” whereas courts require “some aspect of volition”\ndirected at the copyrighted material before direct liability\nmay be imposed. CoStar, 373 F. 3d, at 550–551.2 The\ndefendant may be held directly liable only if the defendant\nitself “trespassed on the exclusive domain of the copyright\nowner.” Id., at 550. Most of the time that issue will come\ndown to who selects the copyrighted content: the defend-\nant or its customers. See Cartoon Network, supra, at\n131–132.\n   A comparison between copy shops and video-on-demand\nservices illustrates the point. A copy shop rents out photo-\ncopiers on a per-use basis. One customer might copy his\n10-year-old’s drawings—a perfectly lawful thing to do—\nwhile another might duplicate a famous artist’s copyrighted\nphotographs—a use clearly prohibited by §106(1). Either\nway, the customer chooses the content and activates the\ncopying function; the photocopier does nothing except in\nresponse to the customer’s commands. Because the shop\nplays no role in selecting the content, it cannot be held\ndirectly liable when a customer makes an infringing copy.\nSee CoStar, supra, at 550.\n\n——————\n    2 Congress has enacted several safe-harbor provisions applicable to\nautomated network processes, see, e.g., 17 U. S. C. §512(a)–(b), but\nthose provisions do not foreclose “any other defense,” §512(l), including\na volitional-conduct defense.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  Video-on-demand services, like photocopiers, respond\nautomatically to user input, but they differ in one crucial\nrespect: They choose the content. When a user signs in to\nNetflix, for example, “thousands of . . . movies [and] TV\nepisodes” carefully curated by Netflix are “available to\nwatch instantly.” See How [D]oes Netflix [W]ork?, online\nat http://help.netflix.com/en/node/412 (as visited June 20,\n2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). That\nselection and arrangement by the service provider consti-\ntutes a volitional act directed to specific copyrighted works\nand thus serves as a basis for direct liability.\n  The distinction between direct and secondary liability\nwould collapse if there were not a clear rule for deter-\nmining whether the defendant committed the infringing\nact. See Cartoon Network, 536 F. 3d, at 132–133. The\nvolitional-conduct requirement supplies that rule; its\npurpose is not to excuse defendants from accountability,\nbut to channel the claims against them into the correct\nanalytical track. See Brief for 36 Intellectual Property\nand Copyright Law Professors as Amici Curiae 7. Thus, in\nthe example given above, the fact that the copy shop does\nnot choose the content simply means that its culpability\nwill be assessed using secondary-liability rules rather\nthan direct-liability rules. See Sony, supra, at 434–442;\nCartoon Network, supra, at 132–133.\n                   II. Application to Aereo\n  So which is Aereo: the copy shop or the video-on-demand\nservice? In truth, it is neither. Rather, it is akin to a copy\nshop that provides its patrons with a library card. Aereo\noffers access to an automated system consisting of routers,\nservers, transcoders, and dime-sized antennae. Like a\nphotocopier or VCR, that system lies dormant until a\nsubscriber activates it. When a subscriber selects a pro-\ngram, Aereo’s system picks up the relevant broadcast\nsignal, translates its audio and video components into\n6        AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndigital data, stores the data in a user-specific file, and\ntransmits that file’s contents to the subscriber via the\nInternet—at which point the subscriber’s laptop, tablet, or\nother device displays the broadcast just as an ordinary\ntelevision would. The result of that process fits the statu-\ntory definition of a performance to a tee: The subscriber’s\ndevice “show[s]” the broadcast’s “images” and “make[s] the\nsounds accompanying” the broadcast “audible.” §101. The\nonly question is whether those performances are the prod-\nuct of Aereo’s volitional conduct.\n   They are not. Unlike video-on-demand services, Aereo\ndoes not provide a prearranged assortment of movies and\ntelevision shows. Rather, it assigns each subscriber an\nantenna that—like a library card—can be used to obtain\nwhatever broadcasts are freely available. Some of those\nbroadcasts are copyrighted; others are in the public do-\nmain. The key point is that subscribers call all the shots:\nAereo’s automated system does not relay any program,\ncopyrighted or not, until a subscriber selects the program\nand tells Aereo to relay it. Aereo’s operation of that sys-\ntem is a volitional act and a but-for cause of the resulting\nperformances, but, as in the case of the copy shop, that\ndegree of involvement is not enough for direct liability.\nSee Grokster, 545 U. S., at 960 (BREYER, J., concurring)\n(“[T]he producer of a technology which permits unlawful\ncopying does not himself engage in unlawful copying”).\n   In sum, Aereo does not “perform” for the sole and simple\nreason that it does not make the choice of content. And\nbecause Aereo does not perform, it cannot be held directly\nliable for infringing the Networks’ public-performance\nright.3 That conclusion does not necessarily mean that\nAereo’s service complies with the Copyright Act. Quite the\n——————\n  3 Because I conclude that Aereo does not perform at all, I do not reach\n\nthe question whether the performances in this case are to the public.\nSee ante, at 10–15.\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   7\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncontrary. The Networks’ complaint alleges that Aereo is\ndirectly and secondarily liable for infringing their public-\nperformance rights (§106(4)) and also their reproduction\nrights (§106(1)). Their request for a preliminary injunc-\ntion—the only issue before this Court—is based exclusively\non the direct-liability portion of the public-performance\nclaim (and further limited to Aereo’s “watch” function, as\nopposed to its “record” function). See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n60a–61a. Affirming the judgment below would merely\nreturn this case to the lower courts for consideration of the\nNetworks’ remaining claims.\n                   III. Guilt By Resemblance\n   The Court’s conclusion that Aereo performs boils down\nto the following syllogism: (1) Congress amended the Act\nto overrule our decisions holding that cable systems do not\nperform when they retransmit over-the-air broadcasts;4 (2)\nAereo looks a lot like a cable system; therefore (3) Aereo\nperforms. Ante, at 4–10. That reasoning suffers from a\ntrio of defects.\n   First, it is built on the shakiest of foundations. Perceiv-\ning the text to be ambiguous, ante, at 4, the Court reaches\nout to decide the case based on a few isolated snippets of\nlegislative history, ante, at 7–8 (citing H. R. Rep. No. 94–\n1476 (1976)). The Court treats those snippets as authori-\ntative evidence of congressional intent even though they\ncome from a single report issued by a committee whose\nmembers make up a small fraction of one of the two Houses\nof Congress. Little else need be said here about the severe\nshortcomings of that interpretative methodology. See\nLawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in principal part and concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 1–2).\n——————\n  4 See Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415\n\nU. S. 394 (1974); Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc.,\n392 U. S. 390 (1968).\n8       AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  Second, the Court’s reasoning fails on its own terms\nbecause there are material differences between the cable\nsystems at issue in Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia\nBroadcasting System, Inc., 415 U. S. 394 (1974), and Fort-\nnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 U. S.\n390 (1968), on the one hand and Aereo on the other. The\nformer (which were then known as community-antenna\ntelevision systems) captured the full range of broadcast\nsignals and forwarded them to all subscribers at all times,\nwhereas Aereo transmits only specific programs selected\nby the user, at specific times selected by the user. The\nCourt acknowledges this distinction but blithely concludes\nthat it “does not make a critical difference.” Ante, at 10.\nEven if that were true, the Court fails to account for other\nsalient differences between the two technologies.5 Though\ncable systems started out essentially as dumb pipes that\nrouted signals from point A to point B, see ante, at 5, by\nthe 1970’s, that kind of service “ ‘no longer exist[ed],’ ”\nBrief for Petitioners in Columbia Broadcasting System,\nInc. v. Teleprompter Corp., O. T. 1973, No. 72–1633, p. 22.\nAt the time of our Teleprompter decision, cable companies\n“perform[ed] the same functions as ‘broadcasters’ by delib-\nerately selecting and importing distant signals, originat-\ning programs, [and] selling commercials,” id., at 20, thus\nmaking them curators of content—more akin to video-on-\ndemand services than copy shops. So far as the record\nreveals, Aereo does none of those things.\n——————\n  5 The Court observes that “[t]he subscribers of the Fortnightly and\n\nTeleprompter cable systems . . . selected what programs to display on\ntheir receiving sets,” but acknowledges that those choices were possible\nonly because “the television signals, in a sense, lurked behind the\nscreen, ready to emerge when the subscriber turned the knob.” Ante, at\n10. The latter point is dispositive: The signals were “ready to emerge”\nbecause the cable system—much like a video-on-demand provider—\ntook affirmative, volitional steps to put them there. As discussed\nabove, the same cannot be said of the programs available through\nAereo’s automated system.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   Third, and most importantly, even accepting that the\n1976 amendments had as their purpose the overruling of\nour cable-TV cases, what they were meant to do and how\nthey did it are two different questions—and it is the latter\nthat governs the case before us here. The injury claimed\nis not violation of a law that says operations similar to\ncable TV are subject to copyright liability, but violation of\n§106(4) of the Copyright Act. And whatever soothing\nreasoning the Court uses to reach its result (“this looks\nlike cable TV”), the consequence of its holding is that\nsomeone who implements this technology “perform[s]”\nunder that provision. That greatly disrupts settled juris-\nprudence which, before today, applied the straightforward,\nbright-line test of volitional conduct directed at the copy-\nrighted work. If that test is not outcome determinative in\nthis case, presumably it is not outcome determinative\nelsewhere as well. And it is not clear what the Court\nproposes to replace it. Perhaps the Court means to adopt\n(invent, really) a two-tier version of the Copyright Act, one\npart of which applies to “cable companies and their equiv-\nalents” while the other governs everyone else. Ante, at 9–\n10, 16.\n   The rationale for the Court’s ad hoc rule for cable-\nsystem lookalikes is so broad that it renders nearly a third\nof the Court’s opinion superfluous. Part II of the opinion\nconcludes that Aereo performs because it resembles a\ncable company, and Congress amended the Act in 1976 “to\nbring the activities of cable systems within [its] scope.”\nAnte, at 8. Part III of the opinion purports to address\nseparately the question whether Aereo performs “pub-\nlicly.” Ante, at 10–15. Trouble is, that question cannot\nremain open if Congress’s supposed intent to regulate\nwhatever looks like a cable company must be given legal\neffect (as the Court says in Part II). The Act reaches only\npublic performances, see §106(4), so Congress could not\nhave regulated “the activities of cable systems” without\n10       AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndeeming their retransmissions public performances. The\nupshot is this: If Aereo’s similarity to a cable company\nmeans that it performs, then by necessity that same char-\nacteristic means that it does so publicly, and Part III of\nthe Court’s opinion discusses an issue that is no longer\nrelevant—though discussing it certainly gives the opinion\nthe “feel” of real textual analysis.\n   Making matters worse, the Court provides no criteria\nfor determining when its cable-TV-lookalike rule applies.\nMust a defendant offer access to live television to qualify?\nIf similarity to cable-television service is the measure,\nthen the answer must be yes. But consider the implica-\ntions of that answer: Aereo would be free to do exactly\nwhat it is doing right now so long as it built mandatory\ntime shifting into its “watch” function.6 Aereo would not\nbe providing live television if it made subscribers wait to\ntune in until after a show’s live broadcast ended. A sub-\nscriber could watch the 7 p.m. airing of a 1-hour program\nany time after 8 p.m. Assuming the Court does not intend\nto adopt such a do-nothing rule (though it very well may),\nthere must be some other means of identifying who is and\nis not subject to its guilt-by-resemblance regime.\n   Two other criteria come to mind. One would cover any\nautomated service that captures and stores live television\nbroadcasts at a user’s direction. That can’t be right, since\nit is exactly what remote storage digital video recorders\n(RS–DVRs) do, see Cartoon Network, 536 F. 3d, at 124–\n125, and the Court insists that its “limited holding” does\nnot decide the fate of those devices, ante, at 16–17. The\nother potential benchmark is the one offered by the Gov-\nernment: The cable-TV-lookalike rule embraces any entity\n——————\n  6 Broadcasts accessible through the “watch” function are technically\n\nnot live because Aereo’s servers take anywhere from a few seconds to a\nfew minutes to begin transmitting data to a subscriber’s device. But\nthe resulting delay is so brief that it cannot reasonably be classified as\ntime shifting.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthat “operates an integrated system, substantially de-\npendent on physical equipment that is used in common by\n[its] subscribers.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n20. The Court sensibly avoids that approach because it\nwould sweep in Internet service providers and a host of\nother entities that quite obviously do not perform.\n   That leaves as the criterion of cable-TV-resemblance\nnothing but th’ol’ totality-of-the-circumstances test (which\nis not a test at all but merely assertion of an intent to\nperform test-free, ad hoc, case-by-case evaluation). It will\ntake years, perhaps decades, to determine which automated\nsystems now in existence are governed by the tradi-\ntional volitional-conduct test and which get the Aereo\ntreatment. (And automated systems now in contemplation\nwill have to take their chances.) The Court vows that its\nruling will not affect cloud-storage providers and cable-\ntelevision systems, see ante, at 16–17, but it cannot deliver\non that promise given the imprecision of its result-driven\nrule. Indeed, the difficulties inherent in the Court’s\nmakeshift approach will become apparent in this very\ncase. Today’s decision addresses the legality of Aereo’s\n“watch” function, which provides nearly contemporaneous\naccess to live broadcasts. On remand, one of the first\nquestions the lower courts will face is whether Aereo’s\n“record” function, which allows subscribers to save a pro-\ngram while it is airing and watch it later, infringes the\nNetworks’ public-performance right.          The volitional-\nconduct rule provides a clear answer to that question:\nBecause Aereo does not select the programs viewed by its\nusers, it does not perform. But it is impossible to say how\nthe issue will come out under the Court’s analysis, since\ncable companies did not offer remote recording and play-\nback services when Congress amended the Copyright Act\nin 1976.\n12     AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC. \n\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting \n\n\n                          *    *    * \n\n   I share the Court’s evident feeling that what Aereo is\ndoing (or enabling to be done) to the Networks’ copyrighted\nprogramming ought not to be allowed. But perhaps we\nneed not distort the Copyright Act to forbid it. As dis-\ncussed at the outset, Aereo’s secondary liability for per-\nformance infringement is yet to be determined, as is its\nprimary and secondary liability for reproduction infringe-\nment. If that does not suffice, then (assuming one shares\nthe majority’s estimation of right and wrong) what we\nhave before us must be considered a “loophole” in the law.\nIt is not the role of this Court to identify and plug loop-\nholes. It is the role of good lawyers to identify and exploit\nthem, and the role of Congress to eliminate them if it\nwishes. Congress can do that, I may add, in a much more\ntargeted, better informed, and less disruptive fashion than\nthe crude “looks-like-cable-TV” solution the Court invents\ntoday.\n   We came within one vote of declaring the VCR contra-\nband 30 years ago in Sony. See 464 U. S., at 441, n. 21.\nThe dissent in that case was driven in part by the plain-\ntiffs’ prediction that VCR technology would wreak all\nmanner of havoc in the television and movie industries.\nSee id., at 483 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); see also Brief for\nCBS, Inc., as Amicus Curiae, O. T. 1982, No. 81–1687, p. 2\n(arguing that VCRs “directly threatened” the bottom line\nof “[e]very broadcaster”).\n   The Networks make similarly dire predictions about\nAereo. We are told that nothing less than “the very exist-\nence of broadcast television as we know it” is at stake.\nBrief for Petitioners 39. Aereo and its amici dispute those\nforecasts and make a few of their own, suggesting that a\ndecision in the Networks’ favor will stifle technological\ninnovation and imperil billions of dollars of investments in\ncloud-storage services.

S., at 958 (BREYER, J., concur-\nring). Hence, the proper course is not to bend and twist\nthe Act’s terms in an effort to produce a just outcome, but\nto apply the law as it stands and leave to Congress the\ntask of deciding whether the Copyright Act needs an\nupgrade. I conclude, as the Court concluded in Sony: “It\nmay well be that Congress will take a fresh look at this\nnew technology, just as it so often has examined other\ninnovations in the past. But it is not our job to apply laws\nthat have not yet been written. Applying the copyright\nstatute, as it now reads, to the facts as they have been\ndeveloped in this case, the judgment of the Court of Ap-\npeals must be [affirmed].” 464 U.

Argued April 22, 2014—Decided June 25, 2014\nThe Copyright Act of 1976 gives a copyright owner the “exclusive\n  righ[t]” to “perform the copyrighted work publicly.” 17 U. S. C.\n  §106(4). The Act’s Transmit Clause defines that exclusive right to in-\n  clude the right to “transmit or otherwise communicate a performance\n  . . . of the [copyrighted] work . . . to the public, by means of any device\n  or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving\n  the performance . . . receive it in the same place or in separate places\n  and at the same time or at different times.” §101.\n      Respondent Aereo, Inc., sells a service that allows its subscribers to\n  watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time\n  as the programs are broadcast over the air. When a subscriber wants\n  to watch a show that is currently airing, he selects the show from a\n  menu on Aereo’s website. Aereo’s system, which consists of thou-\n  sands of small antennas and other equipment housed in a centralized\n  warehouse, responds roughly as follows: A server tunes an antenna,\n  which is dedicated to the use of one subscriber alone, to the broadcast\n  carrying the selected show. A transcoder translates the signals re-\n  ceived by the antenna into data that can be transmitted over the In-\n  ternet. A server saves the data in a subscriber-specific folder on\n  Aereo’s hard drive and begins streaming the show to the subscriber’s\n  screen once several seconds of programming have been saved. The\n  streaming continues, a few seconds behind the over-the-air broadcast,\n  until the subscriber has received the entire show.\n      Petitioners, who are television producers, marketers, distributors,\n  and broadcasters that own the copyrights in many of the programs\n  that Aereo streams, sued Aereo for copyright infringement. They\n  sought a preliminary injunction, arguing that Aereo was infringing\n2         AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    their right to “perform” their copyrighted works “publicly.” The Dis-\n    trict Court denied the preliminary injunction, and the Second Circuit\n    affirmed.\nHeld: Aereo performs petitioners’ works publicly within the meaning of\n the Transmit Clause. Pp. 4–18.\n    (a) Aereo “perform[s].” It does not merely supply equipment that\n allows others to do so. Pp. 4–10.\n      (1) One of Congress’ primary purposes in amending the Copy-\n right Act in 1976 was to overturn this Court’s holdings that the activ-\n ities of community antenna television (CATV) providers fell outside\n the Act’s scope. In Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television,\n Inc., 392 U. S. 390, the Court determined that a CATV provider was\n more like a viewer than a broadcaster, because its system “no more\n than enhances the viewer’s capacity to receive the broadcaster’s sig-\n nals [by] provid[ing] a well-located antenna with an efficient connec-\n tion to the viewer’s television set.” Id., at 399. Therefore, the Court\n concluded, a CATV provider did not perform publicly. The Court\n reached the same determination in respect to a CATV provider that\n retransmitted signals from hundreds of miles away in Teleprompter\n Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U. S. 394. “The re-\n ception and rechanneling of [broadcast television signals] for simul-\n taneous viewing is essentially a viewer function, irrespective of the\n distance between the broadcasting station and the ultimate viewer,”\n the Court said. Id., at 408. Pp. 4–7.\n      (2) In 1976, Congress amended the Copyright Act in large part to\n reject the Fortnightly and Teleprompter holdings. The Act now clari-\n fies that to “perform” an audiovisual work means “to show its images\n in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.”\n §101. Thus, both the broadcaster and the viewer “perform,” because\n they both show a television program’s images and make audible the\n program’s sounds. Congress also enacted the Transmit Clause,\n which specifies that an entity performs when it “transmit[s] . . . a\n performance . . . to the public.” Ibid. The Clause makes clear that an\n entity that acts like a CATV system itself performs, even when it\n simply enhances viewers’ ability to receive broadcast television sig-\n nals. Congress further created a complex licensing scheme that sets\n out the conditions, including the payment of compulsory fees, under\n which cable systems may retransmit broadcasts to the public. §111.\n Congress made all three of these changes to bring cable system activ-\n ities within the Copyright Act’s scope. Pp. 7–8.\n      (3) Because Aereo’s activities are substantially similar to those of\n the CATV companies that Congress amended the Act to reach, Aereo\n is not simply an equipment provider. Aereo sells a service that al-\n lows subscribers to watch television programs, many of which are\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncopyrighted, virtually as they are being broadcast. Aereo uses its\nown equipment, housed in a centralized warehouse, outside of its us-\ners’ homes. By means of its technology, Aereo’s system “receive[s]\nprograms that have been released to the public and carr[ies] them by\nprivate channels to additional viewers.” Fortnightly, supra, at 400.\n  This Court recognizes one particular difference between Aereo’s\nsystem and the cable systems at issue in Fortnightly and Teleprompt-\ner: The systems in those cases transmitted constantly, whereas\nAereo’s system remains inert until a subscriber indicates that she\nwants to watch a program. In other cases involving different kinds of\nservice or technology providers, a user’s involvement in the operation\nof the provider’s equipment and selection of the content transmitted\nmay well bear on whether the provider performs within the meaning\nof the Act. But given Aereo’s overwhelming likeness to the cable\ncompanies targeted by the 1976 amendments, this sole technological\ndifference between Aereo and traditional cable companies does not\nmake a critical difference here. Pp. 8–10.\n  (b) Aereo also performs petitioners’ works “publicly.” Under the\nClause, an entity performs a work publicly when it “transmit[s] . . . a\nperformance . . . of the work . . . to the public.” §101. What perfor-\nmance, if any, does Aereo transmit? Petitioners say Aereo transmits\na prior performance of their works, whereas Aereo says the perfor-\nmance it transmits is the new performance created by its act of\ntransmitting. This Court assumes arguendo that Aereo is correct and\nthus assumes, for present purposes, that to transmit a performance\nof an audiovisual work means to communicate contemporaneously\nvisible images and contemporaneously audible sounds of the work.\nUnder the Court’s assumed definition, Aereo transmits a perfor-\nmance whenever its subscribers watch a program.\n  What about the Clause’s further requirement that Aereo transmit\na performance “to the public”? Aereo claims that because it trans-\nmits from user-specific copies, using individually-assigned antennas,\nand because each transmission is available to only one subscriber, it\ndoes not transmit a performance “to the public.” Viewed in terms of\nCongress’ regulatory objectives, these behind-the-scenes technological\ndifferences do not distinguish Aereo’s system from cable systems,\nwhich do perform publicly. Congress would as much have intended to\nprotect a copyright holder from the unlicensed activities of Aereo as\nfrom those of cable companies.\n  The text of the Clause effectuates Congress’ intent. Under the\nClause, an entity may transmit a performance through multiple\ntransmissions, where the performance is of the same work. Thus\nwhen an entity communicates the same contemporaneously percepti-\nble images and sounds to multiple people, it “transmit[s] . . . a per-\n4         AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    formance” to them, irrespective of the number of discrete communica-\n    tions it makes and irrespective of whether it transmits using a single\n    copy of the work or, as Aereo does, using an individual personal copy\n    for each viewer.\n       Moreover, the subscribers to whom Aereo transmits constitute “the\n    public” under the Act. This is because Aereo communicates the same\n    contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to a large number\n    of people who are unrelated and unknown to each other. In addition,\n    neither the record nor Aereo suggests that Aereo’s subscribers receive\n    performances in their capacities as owners or possessors of the under-\n    lying works. This is relevant because when an entity performs to a\n    set of people, whether they constitute “the public” often depends upon\n    their relationship to the underlying work. Finally, the statute makes\n    clear that the fact that Aereo’s subscribers may receive the same pro-\n    grams at different times and locations is of no consequence. Aereo\n    transmits a performance of petitioners’ works “to the public.” Pp. 11–\n    15.\n       (c) Given the limited nature of this holding, the Court does not be-\n    lieve its decision will discourage the emergence or use of different\n    kinds of technologies.

S. C. §106(4). The Act’s Transmit Clause\ndefines that exclusive right as including the right to\n    “transmit or otherwise communicate a performance\n    . . . of the [copyrighted] work . . . to the public, by\n    means of any device or process, whether the members\n    of the public capable of receiving the performance . . .\n    receive it in the same place or in separate places and\n    at the same time or at different times.” §101.\nWe must decide whether respondent Aereo, Inc., infringes\nthis exclusive right by selling its subscribers a technologi-\ncally complex service that allows them to watch television\nprograms over the Internet at about the same time as the\nprograms are broadcast over the air. We conclude that it\ndoes.\n2      AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   For a monthly fee, Aereo offers subscribers broadcast\ntelevision programming over the Internet, virtually as the\nprogramming is being broadcast. Much of this program-\nming is made up of copyrighted works. Aereo neither\nowns the copyright in those works nor holds a license from\nthe copyright owners to perform those works publicly.\n   Aereo’s system is made up of servers, transcoders, and\nthousands of dime-sized antennas housed in a central\nwarehouse. It works roughly as follows: First, when a\nsubscriber wants to watch a show that is currently being\nbroadcast, he visits Aereo’s website and selects, from a list\nof the local programming, the show he wishes to see.\n   Second, one of Aereo’s servers selects an antenna, which\nit dedicates to the use of that subscriber (and that sub-\nscriber alone) for the duration of the selected show. A\nserver then tunes the antenna to the over-the-air broad-\ncast carrying the show. The antenna begins to receive the\nbroadcast, and an Aereo transcoder translates the sig-\nnals received into data that can be transmitted over the\nInternet.\n   Third, rather than directly send the data to the sub-\nscriber, a server saves the data in a subscriber-specific\nfolder on Aereo’s hard drive. In other words, Aereo’s\nsystem creates a subscriber-specific copy—that is, a “per-\nsonal” copy—of the subscriber’s program of choice.\n   Fourth, once several seconds of programming have been\nsaved, Aereo’s server begins to stream the saved copy of\nthe show to the subscriber over the Internet. (The sub-\nscriber may instead direct Aereo to stream the program at\na later time, but that aspect of Aereo’s service is not before\nus.) The subscriber can watch the streamed program on\nthe screen of his personal computer, tablet, smart phone,\nInternet-connected television, or other Internet-connected\ndevice. The streaming continues, a mere few seconds\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

See A Dictionary of Computing\n494 (6th ed. 2008) (defining “streaming” as “[t]he process\nof providing a steady flow of audio or video data so that an\nInternet user is able to access it as it is transmitted”).\n   Aereo emphasizes that the data that its system streams\nto each subscriber are the data from his own personal\ncopy, made from the broadcast signals received by the\nparticular antenna allotted to him. Its system does not\ntransmit data saved in one subscriber’s folder to any other\nsubscriber. When two subscribers wish to watch the same\nprogram, Aereo’s system activates two separate antennas\nand saves two separate copies of the program in two sepa-\nrate folders. It then streams the show to the subscribers\nthrough two separate transmissions—each from the sub-\nscriber’s personal copy.\n                              B\n   Petitioners are television producers, marketers, distrib-\nutors, and broadcasters who own the copyrights in many\nof the programs that Aereo’s system streams to its sub-\nscribers. They brought suit against Aereo for copyright\ninfringement in Federal District Court. They sought a\npreliminary injunction, arguing that Aereo was infringing\ntheir right to “perform” their works “publicly,” as the\nTransmit Clause defines those terms.\n   The District Court denied the preliminary injunction.\n874 F.

In the Second Circuit’s\nview, Aereo does not perform publicly within the meaning\nof the Transmit Clause because it does not transmit “to\nthe public.” Rather, each time Aereo streams a program to\na subscriber, it sends a private transmission that is avail-\n4      AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v.

Aereo, Inc., 722 F. 3d 500 (2013). We granted\ncertiorari.\n                              II\n   This case requires us to answer two questions: First, in\noperating in the manner described above, does Aereo\n“perform” at all? And second, if so, does Aereo do so “pub-\nlicly”? We address these distinct questions in turn.\n   Does Aereo “perform”? See §106(4) (“[T]he owner of [a]\ncopyright . . . has the exclusive righ[t] . . . to perform the\ncopyrighted work publicly” (emphasis added)); §101 (“To\nperform . . . a work ‘publicly’ means [among other things]\nto transmit . . . a performance . . . of the work . . . to the\npublic . . . ” (emphasis added)). Phrased another way, does\nAereo “transmit . . . a performance” when a subscriber\nwatches a show using Aereo’s system, or is it only the\nsubscriber who transmits? In Aereo’s view, it does not\nperform. It does no more than supply equipment that\n“emulate[s] the operation of a home antenna and [digital\nvideo recorder (DVR)].” Brief for Respondent 41. Like a\nhome antenna and DVR, Aereo’s equipment simply re-\nsponds to its subscribers’ directives. So it is only the\nsubscribers who “perform” when they use Aereo’s equip-\nment to stream television programs to themselves.\n   Considered alone, the language of the Act does not\nclearly indicate when an entity “perform[s]” (or “trans-\nmit[s]”) and when it merely supplies equipment that\nallows others to do so. But when read in light of its pur-\npose, the Act is unmistakable: An entity that engages in\nactivities like Aereo’s performs.\n                         A\n  History makes plain that one of Congress’ primary\npurposes in amending the Copyright Act in 1976 was to\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noverturn this Court’s determination that community\nantenna television (CATV) systems (the precursors of\nmodern cable systems) fell outside the Act’s scope. In\nFortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392\nU. S. 390 (1968), the Court considered a CATV system\nthat carried local television broadcasting, much of which\nwas copyrighted, to its subscribers in two cities. The\nCATV provider placed antennas on hills above the cities\nand used coaxial cables to carry the signals received by the\nantennas to the home television sets of its subscribers.\nThe system amplified and modulated the signals in order\nto improve their strength and efficiently transmit them to\nsubscribers. A subscriber “could choose any of the . . .\nprograms he wished to view by simply turning the knob on\nhis own television set.” Id., at 392. The CATV provider\n“neither edited the programs received nor originated any\nprograms of its own.” Ibid.\n    Asked to decide whether the CATV provider infringed\ncopyright holders’ exclusive right to perform their works\npublicly, the Court held that the provider did not “per-\nform” at all. See 17 U. S. C. §1(c) (1964 ed.) (granting\ncopyright holder the exclusive right to “perform . . . in\npublic for profit” a nondramatic literary work), §1(d)\n(granting copyright holder the exclusive right to “perform\n. . . publicly” a dramatic work). The Court drew a line:\n“Broadcasters perform. Viewers do not perform.” 392\nU. S., at 398 (footnote omitted). And a CATV provider\n“falls on the viewer’s side of the line.” Id., at 399.\n    The Court reasoned that CATV providers were unlike\nbroadcasters:\n    “Broadcasters select the programs to be viewed; CATV\n    systems simply carry, without editing, whatever pro-\n    grams they receive. Broadcasters procure programs\n    and propagate them to the public; CATV systems re-\n    ceive programs that have been released to the public\n6      AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    and carry them by private channels to additional\n    viewers.” Id., at 400.\nInstead, CATV providers were more like viewers, for “the\nbasic function [their] equipment serves is little different\nfrom that served by the equipment generally furnished by”\nviewers. Id., at 399. “Essentially,” the Court said, “a\nCATV system no more than enhances the viewer’s capac-\nity to receive the broadcaster’s signals [by] provid[ing] a\nwell-located antenna with an efficient connection to the\nviewer’s television set.” Ibid. Viewers do not become\nperformers by using “amplifying equipment,” and a CATV\nprovider should not be treated differently for providing\nviewers the same equipment. Id., at 398–400.\n   In Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys-\ntem, Inc., 415 U. S. 394 (1974), the Court considered the\ncopyright liability of a CATV provider that carried broad-\ncast television programming into subscribers’ homes from\nhundreds of miles away. Although the Court recognized\nthat a viewer might not be able to afford amplifying\nequipment that would provide access to those distant\nsignals, it nonetheless found that the CATV provider was\nmore like a viewer than a broadcaster. Id., at 408–409. It\nexplained: “The reception and rechanneling of [broadcast\ntelevision signals] for simultaneous viewing is essentially\na viewer function, irrespective of the distance between the\nbroadcasting station and the ultimate viewer.” Id., at 408.\n   The Court also recognized that the CATV system exer-\ncised some measure of choice over what to transmit. But\nthat fact did not transform the CATV system into a broad-\ncaster. A broadcaster exercises significant creativity in\nchoosing what to air, the Court reasoned. Id., at 410. In\ncontrast, the CATV provider makes an initial choice about\nwhich broadcast stations to retransmit, but then “ ‘simply\ncarr[ies], without editing, whatever programs [it] re-\nceive[s].’ ” Ibid.

See H. R. Rep. No. 94–1476, pp. 86–87\n(1976) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (The 1976 amendments\n“completely overturned” this Court’s narrow construction\nof the Act in Fortnightly and Teleprompter). Congress\nenacted new language that erased the Court’s line be-\ntween broadcaster and viewer, in respect to “perform[ing]”\na work. The amended statute clarifies that to “perform”\nan audiovisual work means “to show its images in any\nsequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.”\n§101; see ibid. (defining “[a]udiovisual works” as “works\nthat consist of a series of related images which are intrin-\nsically intended to be shown by the use of machines . . . ,\ntogether with accompanying sounds”). Under this new\nlanguage, both the broadcaster and the viewer of a televi-\nsion program “perform,” because they both show the pro-\ngram’s images and make audible the program’s sounds.\nSee H. R. Rep., at 63 (“[A] broadcasting network is per-\nforming when it transmits [a singer’s performance of a\nsong] . . . and any individual is performing whenever he or\nshe . . . communicates the performance by turning on a\nreceiving set”).\n   Congress also enacted the Transmit Clause, which\nspecifies that an entity performs publicly when it “trans-\nmit[s] . . . a performance . . . to the public.” §101; see ibid.\n(defining “[t]o ‘transmit’ a performance” as “to communi-\ncate it by any device or process whereby images or sounds\nare received beyond the place from which they are sent”).\nCable system activities, like those of the CATV systems in\nFortnightly and Teleprompter, lie at the heart of the activ-\nities that Congress intended this language to cover. See\nH. R. Rep., at 63 (“[A] cable television system is perform-\n8      AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning when it retransmits [a network] broadcast to its sub-\nscribers”); see also ibid. (“[T]he concep[t] of public perfor-\nmance . . . cover[s] not only the initial rendition or show-\ning, but also any further act by which that rendition or\nshowing is transmitted or communicated to the public”).\nThe Clause thus makes clear that an entity that acts like\na CATV system itself performs, even if when doing so, it\nsimply enhances viewers’ ability to receive broadcast\ntelevision signals.\n  Congress further created a new section of the Act to\nregulate cable companies’ public performances of copy-\nrighted works. See §111. Section 111 creates a complex,\nhighly detailed compulsory licensing scheme that sets out\nthe conditions, including the payment of compulsory fees,\nunder which cable systems may retransmit broadcasts.\nH. R. Rep., at 88 (Section 111 is primarily “directed at the\noperation of cable television systems and the terms and\nconditions of their liability for the retransmission of copy-\nrighted works”).\n  Congress made these three changes to achieve a similar\nend: to bring the activities of cable systems within the\nscope of the Copyright Act.\n                              C\n   This history makes clear that Aereo is not simply an\nequipment provider. Rather, Aereo, and not just its sub-\nscribers, “perform[s]” (or “transmit[s]”). Aereo’s activities\nare substantially similar to those of the CATV companies\nthat Congress amended the Act to reach. See id., at 89\n(“[C]able systems are commercial enterprises whose basic\nretransmission operations are based on the carriage of\ncopyrighted program material”). Aereo sells a service that\nallows subscribers to watch television programs, many of\nwhich are copyrighted, almost as they are being broadcast.\nIn providing this service, Aereo uses its own equipment,\nhoused in a centralized warehouse, outside of its users’\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhomes. By means of its technology (antennas, trans-\ncoders, and servers), Aereo’s system “receive[s] programs\nthat have been released to the public and carr[ies] them by\nprivate channels to additional viewers.” Fortnightly, 392\nU. S., at 400. It “carr[ies] . . . whatever programs [it]\nreceive[s],” and it offers “all the programming” of each\nover-the-air station it carries. Id., at 392, 400.\n  Aereo’s equipment may serve a “viewer function”; it may\nenhance the viewer’s ability to receive a broadcaster’s\nprograms. It may even emulate equipment a viewer could\nuse at home. But the same was true of the equipment that\nwas before the Court, and ultimately before Congress, in\nFortnightly and Teleprompter.\n   We recognize, and Aereo and the dissent emphasize,\none particular difference between Aereo’s system and the\ncable systems at issue in Fortnightly and Teleprompter.\nThe systems in those cases transmitted constantly; they\nsent continuous programming to each subscriber’s televi-\nsion set. In contrast, Aereo’s system remains inert until a\nsubscriber indicates that she wants to watch a program.\nOnly at that moment, in automatic response to the sub-\nscriber’s request, does Aereo’s system activate an antenna\nand begin to transmit the requested program.\n  This is a critical difference, says the dissent. It means\nthat Aereo’s subscribers, not Aereo, “selec[t] the copy-\nrighted content” that is “perform[ed],” post, at 4 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.), and for that reason they, not Aereo, “transmit”\nthe performance. Aereo is thus like “a copy shop that\nprovides its patrons with a library card.” Post, at 5. A\ncopy shop is not directly liable whenever a patron uses the\nshop’s machines to “reproduce” copyrighted materials\nfound in that library. See §106(1) (“exclusive righ[t] . . . to\nreproduce the copyrighted work”). And by the same token,\nAereo should not be directly liable whenever its patrons\nuse its equipment to “transmit” copyrighted television\nprograms to their screens.\n10     AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In our view, however, the dissent’s copy shop argument,\nin whatever form, makes too much out of too little. Given\nAereo’s overwhelming likeness to the cable companies\ntargeted by the 1976 amendments, this sole technological\ndifference between Aereo and traditional cable companies\ndoes not make a critical difference here. The subscribers\nof the Fortnightly and Teleprompter cable systems also\nselected what programs to display on their receiving sets.\nIndeed, as we explained in Fortnightly, such a subscriber\n“could choose any of the . . . programs he wished to view by\nsimply turning the knob on his own television set.” 392\nU. S., at 392. The same is true of an Aereo subscriber. Of\ncourse, in Fortnightly the television signals, in a sense,\nlurked behind the screen, ready to emerge when the sub-\nscriber turned the knob. Here the signals pursue their\nordinary course of travel through the universe until to-\nday’s “turn of the knob”—a click on a website—activates\nmachinery that intercepts and reroutes them to Aereo’s\nsubscribers over the Internet. But this difference means\nnothing to the subscriber. It means nothing to the broad-\ncaster. We do not see how this single difference, invisible\nto subscriber and broadcaster alike, could transform a\nsystem that is for all practical purposes a traditional cable\nsystem into “a copy shop that provides its patrons with a\nlibrary card.”\n   In other cases involving different kinds of service or\ntechnology providers, a user’s involvement in the opera-\ntion of the provider’s equipment and selection of the con-\ntent transmitted may well bear on whether the provider\nperforms within the meaning of the Act. But the many\nsimilarities between Aereo and cable companies, consid-\nered in light of Congress’ basic purposes in amending the\nCopyright Act, convince us that this difference is not\ncritical here. We conclude that Aereo is not just an\nequipment supplier and that Aereo “perform[s].”\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014) \n          11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              III\n\n   Next, we must consider whether Aereo performs peti-\ntioners’ works “publicly,” within the meaning of the\nTransmit Clause. Under the Clause, an entity performs a\nwork publicly when it “transmit[s] . . . a performance . . . of\nthe work . . . to the public.” §101. Aereo denies that it\nsatisfies this definition. It reasons as follows: First, the\n“performance” it “transmit[s]” is the performance created\nby its act of transmitting. And second, because each of\nthese performances is capable of being received by one and\nonly one subscriber, Aereo transmits privately, not pub-\nlicly. Even assuming Aereo’s first argument is correct, its\nsecond does not follow.\n   We begin with Aereo’s first argument. What perfor-\nmance does Aereo transmit? Under the Act, “[t]o ‘trans-\nmit’ a performance . . . is to communicate it by any device\nor process whereby images or sounds are received beyond\nthe place from which they are sent.” Ibid. And “[t]o ‘per-\nform’ ” an audiovisual work means “to show its images in\nany sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it\naudible.” Ibid.\n   Petitioners say Aereo transmits a prior performance of\ntheir works. Thus when Aereo retransmits a network’s\nprior broadcast, the underlying broadcast (itself a perfor-\nmance) is the performance that Aereo transmits. Aereo,\nas discussed above, says the performance it transmits is\nthe new performance created by its act of transmitting.\nThat performance comes into existence when Aereo\nstreams the sounds and images of a broadcast program to\na subscriber’s screen.\n   We assume arguendo that Aereo’s first argument is\ncorrect. Thus, for present purposes, to transmit a perfor-\nmance of (at least) an audiovisual work means to com-\nmunicate contemporaneously visible images and contem-\nporaneously audible sounds of the work. Cf. United States\nv. American Soc. of Composers, Authors and Publishers,\n12     AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n627 F. 3d 64, 73 (CA2 2010) (holding that a download of a\nwork is not a performance because the data transmitted\nare not “contemporaneously perceptible”). When an Aereo\nsubscriber selects a program to watch, Aereo streams the\nprogram over the Internet to that subscriber. Aereo\nthereby “communicate[s]” to the subscriber, by means of a\n“device or process,” the work’s images and sounds. §101.\nAnd those images and sounds are contemporaneously\nvisible and audible on the subscriber’s computer (or other\nInternet-connected device). So under our assumed defini-\ntion, Aereo transmits a performance whenever its sub-\nscribers watch a program.\n   But what about the Clause’s further requirement that\nAereo transmit a performance “to the public”? As we have\nsaid, an Aereo subscriber receives broadcast television\nsignals with an antenna dedicated to him alone. Aereo’s\nsystem makes from those signals a personal copy of the\nselected program. It streams the content of the copy to the\nsame subscriber and to no one else. One and only one\nsubscriber has the ability to see and hear each Aereo\ntransmission. The fact that each transmission is to only\none subscriber, in Aereo’s view, means that it does not\ntransmit a performance “to the public.”\n   In terms of the Act’s purposes, these differences do not\ndistinguish Aereo’s system from cable systems, which do\nperform “publicly.” Viewed in terms of Congress’ regula-\ntory objectives, why should any of these technological differ-\nences matter? They concern the behind-the-scenes way in\nwhich Aereo delivers television programming to its view-\ners’ screens. They do not render Aereo’s commercial objec-\ntive any different from that of cable companies. Nor do\nthey significantly alter the viewing experience of Aereo’s\nsubscribers. Why would a subscriber who wishes to watch\na television show care much whether images and sounds\nare delivered to his screen via a large multisubscriber\nantenna or one small dedicated antenna, whether they\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\narrive instantaneously or after a few seconds’ delay, or\nwhether they are transmitted directly or after a personal\ncopy is made? And why, if Aereo is right, could not mod-\nern CATV systems simply continue the same commercial\nand consumer-oriented activities, free of copyright re-\nstrictions, provided they substitute such new technologies\nfor old? Congress would as much have intended to protect\na copyright holder from the unlicensed activities of Aereo\nas from those of cable companies.\n  The text of the Clause effectuates Congress’ intent.\nAereo’s argument to the contrary relies on the premise\nthat “to transmit . . . a performance” means to make a\nsingle transmission. But the Clause suggests that an\nentity may transmit a performance through multiple,\ndiscrete transmissions. That is because one can “trans-\nmit” or “communicate” something through a set of actions.\nThus one can transmit a message to one’s friends, irre-\nspective of whether one sends separate identical e-mails to\neach friend or a single e-mail to all at once. So can an\nelected official communicate an idea, slogan, or speech to\nher constituents, regardless of whether she communicates\nthat idea, slogan, or speech during individual phone calls\nto each constituent or in a public square.\n  The fact that a singular noun (“a performance”) follows\nthe words “to transmit” does not suggest the contrary.\nOne can sing a song to his family, whether he sings the\nsame song one-on-one or in front of all together. Similarly,\none’s colleagues may watch a performance of a particular\nplay—say, this season’s modern-dress version of “Measure\nfor Measure”—whether they do so at separate or at the\nsame showings. By the same principle, an entity may\ntransmit a performance through one or several transmis-\nsions, where the performance is of the same work.\n  The Transmit Clause must permit this interpretation,\nfor it provides that one may transmit a performance to the\npublic “whether the members of the public capable of\n14     AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreceiving the performance . . . receive it . . . at the same\ntime or at different times.” §101. Were the words “to\ntransmit . . . a performance” limited to a single act of\ncommunication, members of the public could not receive\nthe performance communicated “at different times.”\nTherefore, in light of the purpose and text of the Clause,\nwe conclude that when an entity communicates the same\ncontemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to\nmultiple people, it transmits a performance to them re-\ngardless of the number of discrete communications it\nmakes.\n   We do not see how the fact that Aereo transmits via\npersonal copies of programs could make a difference. The\nAct applies to transmissions “by means of any device or\nprocess.” Ibid. And retransmitting a television program\nusing user-specific copies is a “process” of transmitting a\nperformance. A “cop[y]” of a work is simply a “material\nobjec[t] . . . in which a work is fixed . . . and from which the\nwork can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communi-\ncated.” Ibid. So whether Aereo transmits from the same\nor separate copies, it performs the same work; it shows the\nsame images and makes audible the same sounds. There-\nfore, when Aereo streams the same television program to\nmultiple subscribers, it “transmit[s] . . . a performance” to\nall of them.\n   Moreover, the subscribers to whom Aereo transmits\ntelevision programs constitute “the public.” Aereo com-\nmunicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images\nand sounds to a large number of people who are unre-\nlated and unknown to each other. This matters because,\nalthough the Act does not define “the public,” it specifies\nthat an entity performs publicly when it performs at “any\nplace where a substantial number of persons outside of a\nnormal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is\ngathered.” Ibid. The Act thereby suggests that “the pub-\nlic” consists of a large group of people outside of a family\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand friends.\n   Neither the record nor Aereo suggests that Aereo’s\nsubscribers receive performances in their capacities as\nowners or possessors of the underlying works. This is\nrelevant because when an entity performs to a set of peo-\nple, whether they constitute “the public” often depends\nupon their relationship to the underlying work. When, for\nexample, a valet parking attendant returns cars to their\ndrivers, we would not say that the parking service pro-\nvides cars “to the public.” We would say that it provides\nthe cars to their owners. We would say that a car dealer-\nship, on the other hand, does provide cars to the public, for\nit sells cars to individuals who lack a pre-existing relation-\nship to the cars. Similarly, an entity that transmits a\nperformance to individuals in their capacities as owners or\npossessors does not perform to “the public,” whereas an\nentity like Aereo that transmits to large numbers of pay-\ning subscribers who lack any prior relationship to the\nworks does so perform.\n   Finally, we note that Aereo’s subscribers may receive\nthe same programs at different times and locations. This\nfact does not help Aereo, however, for the Transmit Clause\nexpressly provides that an entity may perform publicly\n“whether the members of the public capable of receiving\nthe performance . . . receive it in the same place or in\nseparate places and at the same time or at different\ntimes.” Ibid. In other words, “the public” need not be\nsituated together, spatially or temporally. For these\nreasons, we conclude that Aereo transmits a performance\nof petitioners’ copyrighted works to the public, within the\nmeaning of the Transmit Clause.\n                           IV\n  Aereo and many of its supporting amici argue that to\napply the Transmit Clause to Aereo’s conduct will impose\ncopyright liability on other technologies, including new\n16     AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntechnologies, that Congress could not possibly have wanted\nto reach. We agree that Congress, while intending the\nTransmit Clause to apply broadly to cable companies and\ntheir equivalents, did not intend to discourage or to control\nthe emergence or use of different kinds of technologies.\nBut we do not believe that our limited holding today will\nhave that effect.\n   For one thing, the history of cable broadcast transmis-\nsions that led to the enactment of the Transmit Clause\ninforms our conclusion that Aereo “perform[s],” but it does\nnot determine whether different kinds of providers in\ndifferent contexts also “perform.” For another, an entity\nonly transmits a performance when it communicates\ncontemporaneously perceptible images and sounds of a\nwork. See Brief for Respondent 31 (“[I]f a distributor . . .\nsells [multiple copies of a digital video disc] by mail to\nconsumers, . . . [its] distribution of the DVDs merely\nmakes it possible for the recipients to perform the work\nthemselves—it is not a ‘device or process’ by which the\ndistributor publicly performs the work” (emphasis in\noriginal)).\n   Further, we have interpreted the term “the public” to\napply to a group of individuals acting as ordinary mem-\nbers of the public who pay primarily to watch broadcast\ntelevision programs, many of which are copyrighted. We\nhave said that it does not extend to those who act as own-\ners or possessors of the relevant product. And we have not\nconsidered whether the public performance right is in-\nfringed when the user of a service pays primarily for\nsomething other than the transmission of copyrighted\nworks, such as the remote storage of content. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 31 (distinguishing cloud-\nbased storage services because they “offer consumers more\nnumerous and convenient means of playing back copies\nthat the consumers have already lawfully acquired” (em-\nphasis in original)). In addition, an entity does not trans-\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Universal City Studios, Inc.,\n464 U. S. 417 (1984).\n  We cannot now answer more precisely how the Transmit\nClause or other provisions of the Copyright Act will apply\nto technologies not before us. We agree with the Solicitor\nGeneral that “[q]uestions involving cloud computing,\n[remote storage] DVRs, and other novel issues not before\nthe Court, as to which ‘Congress has not plainly marked\n[the] course,’ should await a case in which they are\nsquarely presented.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 34 (quoting Sony, supra, at 431 (alteration in\noriginal)). And we note that, to the extent commercial\nactors or other interested entities may be concerned with\nthe relationship between the development and use of such\ntechnologies and the Copyright Act, they are of course free\nto seek action from Congress. Cf. Digital Millennium\nCopyright Act, 17 U. S. C. §512.\n                         *     *   *\n   In sum, having considered the details of Aereo’s practices,\nwe find them highly similar to those of the CATV systems\nin Fortnightly and Teleprompter. And those are activities\nthat the 1976 amendments sought to bring within the\nscope of the Copyright Act. Insofar as there are differ-\nences, those differences concern not the nature of the\nservice that Aereo provides so much as the technological\nmanner in which it provides the service. We conclude that\nthose differences are not adequate to place Aereo’s activi-\nties outside the scope of the Act.\n   For these reasons, we conclude that Aereo “perform[s]”\n18     AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners’ copyrighted works “publicly,” as those terms\nare defined by the Transmit Clause.

Petitioners, a collection of television networks and\naffiliates (Networks), broadcast copyrighted programs on\nthe public airwaves for all to see. Aereo, respondent,\noperates an automated system that allows subscribers to\nreceive, on Internet-connected devices, programs that they\nselect, including the Networks’ copyrighted programs.\nThe Networks sued Aereo for several forms of copyright\ninfringement, but we are here concerned with a single\nclaim: that Aereo violates the Networks’ “exclusive righ[t]”\nto “perform” their programs “publicly.”         17 U. S. C.\n§106(4). That claim fails at the very outset because Aereo\ndoes not “perform” at all. The Court manages to reach the\nopposite conclusion only by disregarding widely accepted\nrules for service-provider liability and adopting in their\nplace an improvised standard (“looks-like-cable-TV”) that\nwill sow confusion for years to come.\n                   I. Legal Standard\n There are two types of liability for copyright infringe-\nment: direct and secondary. As its name suggests, the\n2      AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nformer applies when an actor personally engages in in-\nfringing conduct. See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal\nCity Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, 433 (1984). Secondary\nliability, by contrast, is a means of holding defendants\nresponsible for infringement by third parties, even when\nthe defendants “have not themselves engaged in the in-\nfringing activity.” Id., at 435. It applies when a defendant\n“intentionally induc[es] or encourag[es]” infringing acts by\nothers or profits from such acts “while declining to exer-\ncise a right to stop or limit [them].” Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\nStudios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U. S. 913, 930 (2005).\n   Most suits against equipment manufacturers and ser-\nvice providers involve secondary-liability claims. For ex-\nample, when movie studios sued to block the sale of\nSony’s Betamax videocassette recorder (VCR), they argued\nthat Sony was liable because its customers were making\nunauthorized copies. See Sony, supra, at 434–435. Record\nlabels and movie studios relied on a similar theory when\nthey sued Grokster and StreamCast, two providers of\npeer-to-peer file-sharing software. See Grokster, supra, at\n920–921, 927.\n   This suit, or rather the portion of it before us here, is\nfundamentally different. The Networks claim that Aereo\ndirectly infringes their public-performance right. Accord-\ningly, the Networks must prove that Aereo “perform[s]”\ncopyrighted works, §106(4), when its subscribers log in,\nselect a channel, and push the “watch” button. That pro-\ncess undoubtedly results in a performance; the question is\nwho does the performing. See Cartoon Network LP, LLLP\nv. CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F. 3d 121, 130 (CA2 2008). If\nAereo’s subscribers perform but Aereo does not, the claim\nnecessarily fails.\n   The Networks’ claim is governed by a simple but pro-\nfoundly important rule: A defendant may be held directly\nliable only if it has engaged in volitional conduct that\nviolates the Act. See 3 W. Patry, Copyright §9:5.50 (2013).\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   3\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nThis requirement is firmly grounded in the Act’s text,\nwhich defines “perform” in active, affirmative terms: One\n“perform[s]” a copyrighted “audiovisual work,” such as a\nmovie or news broadcast, by “show[ing] its images in any\nsequence” or “mak[ing] the sounds accompanying it audi-\nble.” §101. And since the Act makes it unlawful to copy or\nperform copyrighted works, not to copy or perform in\ngeneral, see §501(a), the volitional-act requirement de-\nmands conduct directed to the plaintiff ’s copyrighted\nmaterial, see Sony, supra, at 434. Every Court of Appeals\nto have considered an automated-service provider’s direct\nliability for copyright infringement has adopted that rule.\nSee Fox Broadcasting Co. v. Dish Network LLC, 747 F. 3d\n1060, 1066–1068 (CA9 2014); Cartoon Network, supra, at\n130–131 (CA2 2008); CoStar Group, Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc.,\n373 F. 3d 544, 549–550 (CA4 2004).1 Although we have\nnot opined on the issue, our cases are fully consistent with\na volitional-conduct requirement. For example, we gave\nseveral examples of direct infringement in Sony, each of\nwhich involved a volitional act directed to the plaintiff ’s\ncopyrighted material. See 464 U. S., at 437, n. 18.\n   The volitional-conduct requirement is not at issue in\nmost direct-infringement cases; the usual point of dispute\nis whether the defendant’s conduct is infringing (e.g., Does\nthe defendant’s design copy the plaintiff ’s?), rather than\nwhether the defendant has acted at all (e.g., Did this\ndefendant create the infringing design?). But it comes\nright to the fore when a direct-infringement claim is\n——————\n  1 An unpublished decision of the Third Circuit is to the same effect.\nParker v. Google, Inc., 242 Fed. Appx. 833, 836–837 (2007) (per curiam).\n  The Networks muster only one case they say stands for a different\napproach, New York Times Co. v. Tasini, 533 U. S. 483 (2001). Reply\nBrief 18. But Tasini is clearly inapposite; it dealt with the question\nwhether the defendants’ copying was permissible, not whether the\ndefendants were the ones who made the copies. See 533 U. S., at 487–\n488, 492, 504–506.\n4         AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nlodged against a defendant who does nothing more than\noperate an automated, user-controlled system. See, e.g.,\nFox Broadcasting, supra, at 1067; Cartoon Network, supra,\nat 131. Internet-service providers are a prime example.\nWhen one user sends data to another, the provider’s\nequipment facilitates the transfer automatically. Does\nthat mean that the provider is directly liable when the\ntransmission happens to result in the “reproduc[tion],”\n§106(1), of a copyrighted work? It does not. The provid-\ner’s system is “totally indifferent to the material’s con-\ntent,” whereas courts require “some aspect of volition”\ndirected at the copyrighted material before direct liability\nmay be imposed. CoStar, 373 F. 3d, at 550–551.2 The\ndefendant may be held directly liable only if the defendant\nitself “trespassed on the exclusive domain of the copyright\nowner.” Id., at 550. Most of the time that issue will come\ndown to who selects the copyrighted content: the defend-\nant or its customers. See Cartoon Network, supra, at\n131–132.\n   A comparison between copy shops and video-on-demand\nservices illustrates the point. A copy shop rents out photo-\ncopiers on a per-use basis. One customer might copy his\n10-year-old’s drawings—a perfectly lawful thing to do—\nwhile another might duplicate a famous artist’s copyrighted\nphotographs—a use clearly prohibited by §106(1). Either\nway, the customer chooses the content and activates the\ncopying function; the photocopier does nothing except in\nresponse to the customer’s commands. Because the shop\nplays no role in selecting the content, it cannot be held\ndirectly liable when a customer makes an infringing copy.\nSee CoStar, supra, at 550.\n\n——————\n    2 Congress has enacted several safe-harbor provisions applicable to\nautomated network processes, see, e.g., 17 U. S. C. §512(a)–(b), but\nthose provisions do not foreclose “any other defense,” §512(l), including\na volitional-conduct defense.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  Video-on-demand services, like photocopiers, respond\nautomatically to user input, but they differ in one crucial\nrespect: They choose the content. When a user signs in to\nNetflix, for example, “thousands of . . . movies [and] TV\nepisodes” carefully curated by Netflix are “available to\nwatch instantly.” See How [D]oes Netflix [W]ork?, online\nat http://help.netflix.com/en/node/412 (as visited June 20,\n2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). That\nselection and arrangement by the service provider consti-\ntutes a volitional act directed to specific copyrighted works\nand thus serves as a basis for direct liability.\n  The distinction between direct and secondary liability\nwould collapse if there were not a clear rule for deter-\nmining whether the defendant committed the infringing\nact. See Cartoon Network, 536 F. 3d, at 132–133. The\nvolitional-conduct requirement supplies that rule; its\npurpose is not to excuse defendants from accountability,\nbut to channel the claims against them into the correct\nanalytical track. See Brief for 36 Intellectual Property\nand Copyright Law Professors as Amici Curiae 7. Thus, in\nthe example given above, the fact that the copy shop does\nnot choose the content simply means that its culpability\nwill be assessed using secondary-liability rules rather\nthan direct-liability rules. See Sony, supra, at 434–442;\nCartoon Network, supra, at 132–133.\n                   II. Application to Aereo\n  So which is Aereo: the copy shop or the video-on-demand\nservice? In truth, it is neither. Rather, it is akin to a copy\nshop that provides its patrons with a library card. Aereo\noffers access to an automated system consisting of routers,\nservers, transcoders, and dime-sized antennae. Like a\nphotocopier or VCR, that system lies dormant until a\nsubscriber activates it. When a subscriber selects a pro-\ngram, Aereo’s system picks up the relevant broadcast\nsignal, translates its audio and video components into\n6        AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndigital data, stores the data in a user-specific file, and\ntransmits that file’s contents to the subscriber via the\nInternet—at which point the subscriber’s laptop, tablet, or\nother device displays the broadcast just as an ordinary\ntelevision would. The result of that process fits the statu-\ntory definition of a performance to a tee: The subscriber’s\ndevice “show[s]” the broadcast’s “images” and “make[s] the\nsounds accompanying” the broadcast “audible.” §101. The\nonly question is whether those performances are the prod-\nuct of Aereo’s volitional conduct.\n   They are not. Unlike video-on-demand services, Aereo\ndoes not provide a prearranged assortment of movies and\ntelevision shows. Rather, it assigns each subscriber an\nantenna that—like a library card—can be used to obtain\nwhatever broadcasts are freely available. Some of those\nbroadcasts are copyrighted; others are in the public do-\nmain. The key point is that subscribers call all the shots:\nAereo’s automated system does not relay any program,\ncopyrighted or not, until a subscriber selects the program\nand tells Aereo to relay it. Aereo’s operation of that sys-\ntem is a volitional act and a but-for cause of the resulting\nperformances, but, as in the case of the copy shop, that\ndegree of involvement is not enough for direct liability.\nSee Grokster, 545 U. S., at 960 (BREYER, J., concurring)\n(“[T]he producer of a technology which permits unlawful\ncopying does not himself engage in unlawful copying”).\n   In sum, Aereo does not “perform” for the sole and simple\nreason that it does not make the choice of content. And\nbecause Aereo does not perform, it cannot be held directly\nliable for infringing the Networks’ public-performance\nright.3 That conclusion does not necessarily mean that\nAereo’s service complies with the Copyright Act. Quite the\n——————\n  3 Because I conclude that Aereo does not perform at all, I do not reach\n\nthe question whether the performances in this case are to the public.\nSee ante, at 10–15.\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   7\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncontrary. The Networks’ complaint alleges that Aereo is\ndirectly and secondarily liable for infringing their public-\nperformance rights (§106(4)) and also their reproduction\nrights (§106(1)). Their request for a preliminary injunc-\ntion—the only issue before this Court—is based exclusively\non the direct-liability portion of the public-performance\nclaim (and further limited to Aereo’s “watch” function, as\nopposed to its “record” function). See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n60a–61a. Affirming the judgment below would merely\nreturn this case to the lower courts for consideration of the\nNetworks’ remaining claims.\n                   III. Guilt By Resemblance\n   The Court’s conclusion that Aereo performs boils down\nto the following syllogism: (1) Congress amended the Act\nto overrule our decisions holding that cable systems do not\nperform when they retransmit over-the-air broadcasts;4 (2)\nAereo looks a lot like a cable system; therefore (3) Aereo\nperforms. Ante, at 4–10. That reasoning suffers from a\ntrio of defects.\n   First, it is built on the shakiest of foundations. Perceiv-\ning the text to be ambiguous, ante, at 4, the Court reaches\nout to decide the case based on a few isolated snippets of\nlegislative history, ante, at 7–8 (citing H. R. Rep. No. 94–\n1476 (1976)). The Court treats those snippets as authori-\ntative evidence of congressional intent even though they\ncome from a single report issued by a committee whose\nmembers make up a small fraction of one of the two Houses\nof Congress. Little else need be said here about the severe\nshortcomings of that interpretative methodology. See\nLawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in principal part and concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 1–2).\n——————\n  4 See Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415\n\nU.

AEREO, INC.\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  Second, the Court’s reasoning fails on its own terms\nbecause there are material differences between the cable\nsystems at issue in Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia\nBroadcasting System, Inc., 415 U. S. 394 (1974), and Fort-\nnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 U. S.\n390 (1968), on the one hand and Aereo on the other. The\nformer (which were then known as community-antenna\ntelevision systems) captured the full range of broadcast\nsignals and forwarded them to all subscribers at all times,\nwhereas Aereo transmits only specific programs selected\nby the user, at specific times selected by the user. The\nCourt acknowledges this distinction but blithely concludes\nthat it “does not make a critical difference.” Ante, at 10.\nEven if that were true, the Court fails to account for other\nsalient differences between the two technologies.5 Though\ncable systems started out essentially as dumb pipes that\nrouted signals from point A to point B, see ante, at 5, by\nthe 1970’s, that kind of service “ ‘no longer exist[ed],’ ”\nBrief for Petitioners in Columbia Broadcasting System,\nInc. v.

T. 1973, No. 72–1633, p. 22.\nAt the time of our Teleprompter decision, cable companies\n“perform[ed] the same functions as ‘broadcasters’ by delib-\nerately selecting and importing distant signals, originat-\ning programs, [and] selling commercials,” id., at 20, thus\nmaking them curators of content—more akin to video-on-\ndemand services than copy shops. So far as the record\nreveals, Aereo does none of those things.\n——————\n  5 The Court observes that “[t]he subscribers of the Fortnightly and\n\nTeleprompter cable systems . . . selected what programs to display on\ntheir receiving sets,” but acknowledges that those choices were possible\nonly because “the television signals, in a sense, lurked behind the\nscreen, ready to emerge when the subscriber turned the knob.” Ante, at\n10. The latter point is dispositive: The signals were “ready to emerge”\nbecause the cable system—much like a video-on-demand provider—\ntook affirmative, volitional steps to put them there. As discussed\nabove, the same cannot be said of the programs available through\nAereo’s automated system.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   Third, and most importantly, even accepting that the\n1976 amendments had as their purpose the overruling of\nour cable-TV cases, what they were meant to do and how\nthey did it are two different questions—and it is the latter\nthat governs the case before us here. The injury claimed\nis not violation of a law that says operations similar to\ncable TV are subject to copyright liability, but violation of\n§106(4) of the Copyright Act. And whatever soothing\nreasoning the Court uses to reach its result (“this looks\nlike cable TV”), the consequence of its holding is that\nsomeone who implements this technology “perform[s]”\nunder that provision. That greatly disrupts settled juris-\nprudence which, before today, applied the straightforward,\nbright-line test of volitional conduct directed at the copy-\nrighted work. If that test is not outcome determinative in\nthis case, presumably it is not outcome determinative\nelsewhere as well. And it is not clear what the Court\nproposes to replace it. Perhaps the Court means to adopt\n(invent, really) a two-tier version of the Copyright Act, one\npart of which applies to “cable companies and their equiv-\nalents” while the other governs everyone else. Ante, at 9–\n10, 16.\n   The rationale for the Court’s ad hoc rule for cable-\nsystem lookalikes is so broad that it renders nearly a third\nof the Court’s opinion superfluous. Part II of the opinion\nconcludes that Aereo performs because it resembles a\ncable company, and Congress amended the Act in 1976 “to\nbring the activities of cable systems within [its] scope.”\nAnte, at 8. Part III of the opinion purports to address\nseparately the question whether Aereo performs “pub-\nlicly.” Ante, at 10–15. Trouble is, that question cannot\nremain open if Congress’s supposed intent to regulate\nwhatever looks like a cable company must be given legal\neffect (as the Court says in Part II). The Act reaches only\npublic performances, see §106(4), so Congress could not\nhave regulated “the activities of cable systems” without\n10       AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC.\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndeeming their retransmissions public performances. The\nupshot is this: If Aereo’s similarity to a cable company\nmeans that it performs, then by necessity that same char-\nacteristic means that it does so publicly, and Part III of\nthe Court’s opinion discusses an issue that is no longer\nrelevant—though discussing it certainly gives the opinion\nthe “feel” of real textual analysis.\n   Making matters worse, the Court provides no criteria\nfor determining when its cable-TV-lookalike rule applies.\nMust a defendant offer access to live television to qualify?\nIf similarity to cable-television service is the measure,\nthen the answer must be yes. But consider the implica-\ntions of that answer: Aereo would be free to do exactly\nwhat it is doing right now so long as it built mandatory\ntime shifting into its “watch” function.6 Aereo would not\nbe providing live television if it made subscribers wait to\ntune in until after a show’s live broadcast ended. A sub-\nscriber could watch the 7 p.m. airing of a 1-hour program\nany time after 8 p.m. Assuming the Court does not intend\nto adopt such a do-nothing rule (though it very well may),\nthere must be some other means of identifying who is and\nis not subject to its guilt-by-resemblance regime.\n   Two other criteria come to mind. One would cover any\nautomated service that captures and stores live television\nbroadcasts at a user’s direction. That can’t be right, since\nit is exactly what remote storage digital video recorders\n(RS–DVRs) do, see Cartoon Network, 536 F. 3d, at 124–\n125, and the Court insists that its “limited holding” does\nnot decide the fate of those devices, ante, at 16–17. The\nother potential benchmark is the one offered by the Gov-\nernment: The cable-TV-lookalike rule embraces any entity\n——————\n  6 Broadcasts accessible through the “watch” function are technically\n\nnot live because Aereo’s servers take anywhere from a few seconds to a\nfew minutes to begin transmitting data to a subscriber’s device. But\nthe resulting delay is so brief that it cannot reasonably be classified as\ntime shifting.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthat “operates an integrated system, substantially de-\npendent on physical equipment that is used in common by\n[its] subscribers.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n20. The Court sensibly avoids that approach because it\nwould sweep in Internet service providers and a host of\nother entities that quite obviously do not perform.\n   That leaves as the criterion of cable-TV-resemblance\nnothing but th’ol’ totality-of-the-circumstances test (which\nis not a test at all but merely assertion of an intent to\nperform test-free, ad hoc, case-by-case evaluation). It will\ntake years, perhaps decades, to determine which automated\nsystems now in existence are governed by the tradi-\ntional volitional-conduct test and which get the Aereo\ntreatment. (And automated systems now in contemplation\nwill have to take their chances.) The Court vows that its\nruling will not affect cloud-storage providers and cable-\ntelevision systems, see ante, at 16–17, but it cannot deliver\non that promise given the imprecision of its result-driven\nrule. Indeed, the difficulties inherent in the Court’s\nmakeshift approach will become apparent in this very\ncase. Today’s decision addresses the legality of Aereo’s\n“watch” function, which provides nearly contemporaneous\naccess to live broadcasts. On remand, one of the first\nquestions the lower courts will face is whether Aereo’s\n“record” function, which allows subscribers to save a pro-\ngram while it is airing and watch it later, infringes the\nNetworks’ public-performance right.          The volitional-\nconduct rule provides a clear answer to that question:\nBecause Aereo does not select the programs viewed by its\nusers, it does not perform. But it is impossible to say how\nthe issue will come out under the Court’s analysis, since\ncable companies did not offer remote recording and play-\nback services when Congress amended the Copyright Act\nin 1976.\n12     AMERICAN BROADCASTING COS. v. AEREO, INC. \n\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting \n\n\n                          *    *    * \n\n   I share the Court’s evident feeling that what Aereo is\ndoing (or enabling to be done) to the Networks’ copyrighted\nprogramming ought not to be allowed. But perhaps we\nneed not distort the Copyright Act to forbid it. As dis-\ncussed at the outset, Aereo’s secondary liability for per-\nformance infringement is yet to be determined, as is its\nprimary and secondary liability for reproduction infringe-\nment. If that does not suffice, then (assuming one shares\nthe majority’s estimation of right and wrong) what we\nhave before us must be considered a “loophole” in the law.\nIt is not the role of this Court to identify and plug loop-\nholes. It is the role of good lawyers to identify and exploit\nthem, and the role of Congress to eliminate them if it\nwishes. Congress can do that, I may add, in a much more\ntargeted, better informed, and less disruptive fashion than\nthe crude “looks-like-cable-TV” solution the Court invents\ntoday.\n   We came within one vote of declaring the VCR contra-\nband 30 years ago in Sony. See 464 U. S., at 441, n. 21.\nThe dissent in that case was driven in part by the plain-\ntiffs’ prediction that VCR technology would wreak all\nmanner of havoc in the television and movie industries.\nSee id., at 483 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); see also Brief for\nCBS, Inc., as Amicus Curiae, O. T. 1982, No. 81–1687, p. 2\n(arguing that VCRs “directly threatened” the bottom line\nof “[e]very broadcaster”).\n   The Networks make similarly dire predictions about\nAereo. We are told that nothing less than “the very exist-\nence of broadcast television as we know it” is at stake.\nBrief for Petitioners 39. Aereo and its amici dispute those\nforecasts and make a few of their own, suggesting that a\ndecision in the Networks’ favor will stifle technological\ninnovation and imperil billions of dollars of investments in\ncloud-storage services. See Brief for Respondents 48–51;\nBrief for BSA, The Software Alliance as Amicus Curiae 5–\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n13. We are in no position to judge the validity of those\nself-interested claims or to foresee the path of future\ntechnological development. See Sony, supra, at 430–431;\nsee also Grokster, 545 U. S., at 958 (BREYER, J., concur-\nring). Hence, the proper course is not to bend and twist\nthe Act’s terms in an effort to produce a just outcome, but\nto apply the law as it stands and leave to Congress the\ntask of deciding whether the Copyright Act needs an\nupgrade. I conclude, as the Court concluded in Sony: “It\nmay well be that Congress will take a fresh look at this\nnew technology, just as it so often has examined other\ninnovations in the past. But it is not our job to apply laws\nthat have not yet been written. Applying the copyright\nstatute, as it now reads, to the facts as they have been\ndeveloped in this case, the judgment of the Court of Ap-\npeals must be [affirmed].” 464 U. S., at 456.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2680437/", "sha1": "94db4fc4a858b743b82828ea34288cb568547a7d", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-067", "time_retrieved": "2014-06-25T08:01:06.720978"}
