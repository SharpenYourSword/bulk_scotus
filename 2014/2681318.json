Argued January 21, 2014—Decided June 30, 2014\nIllinois’ Home Services Program (Rehabilitation Program) allows Medi-\n   caid recipients who would normally need institutional care to hire a\n   “personal assistant” (PA) to provide homecare services. Under State\n   law, the homecare recipients (designated “customers”) and the State\n   both play some role in the employment relationship with the PAs.\n   Customers control most aspects of the employment relationship, in-\n   cluding the hiring, firing, training, supervising, and disciplining of\n   PAs; they also define the PA’s duties by proposing a “Service Plan.”\n   Other than compensating PAs, the State’s involvement in employ-\n   ment matters is minimal. Its employer status was created by execu-\n   tive order, and later codified by the legislature, solely to permit PAs\n   to join a labor union and engage in collective bargaining under Illi-\n   nois’ Public Labor Relations Act (PLRA).\n      Pursuant to this scheme, respondent SEIU Healthcare Illinois &\n   Indiana (SEIU–HII) was designated the exclusive union representa-\n   tive for Rehabilitation Program employees. The union entered into\n   collective-bargaining agreements with the State that contained an\n   agency-fee provision, which requires all bargaining unit members\n   who do not wish to join the union to pay the union a fee for the cost of\n   certain activities, including those tied to the collective-bargaining\n   process. A group of Rehabilitation Program PAs brought a class ac-\n   tion against SEIU–HII and other respondents in Federal District\n   Court, claiming that the PLRA violated the First Amendment insofar\n   as it authorized the agency-fee provision. The District Court dis-\n   missed their claims, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed in relevant\n   part, concluding that the PAs were state employees within the mean-\n   ing of Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209.\n2                         HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: The First Amendment prohibits the collection of an agency fee\n from Rehabilitation Program PAs who do not want to join or support\n the union. Pp. 8–40.\n    (a) In upholding the Illinois law’s constitutionality, the Seventh\n Circuit relied on Abood, which, in turn, relied on Railway Employes\n v. Hanson, 351 U. S. 225, and Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740.\n Unlike Abood, those cases involved private-sector collective-\n bargaining agreements. The Abood Court treated the First Amend-\n ment issue as largely settled by Hanson and Street and understood\n those cases to have upheld agency fees based on the desirability of\n “labor peace” and the problem of “ ‘free riders[hip].’ ” 431 U. S., 220–\n 222, 224. However, “preventing nonmembers from free-riding on the\n union’s efforts” is a rationale “generally insufficient to overcome First\n Amendment objections,” Knox v. Service Employees, 567 U. S. ___,\n ___, and in this respect, Abood is “something of an anomaly,” 567\n U. S., at ___.\n    The Abood Court’s analysis is questionable on several grounds.\n The First Amendment analysis in Hanson was thin, and Street was\n not a constitutional decision. And the Court fundamentally misun-\n derstood Hanson’s narrow holding, which upheld the authorization,\n not imposition, of an agency fee. The Abood Court also failed to ap-\n preciate the distinction between core union speech in the public sec-\n tor and core union speech in the private sector, as well as the concep-\n tual difficulty in public-sector cases of distinguishing union\n expenditures for collective bargaining from those designed for politi-\n cal purposes. Nor does the Abood Court seem to have anticipated the\n administrative problems that would result in attempting to classify\n union expenditures as either chargeable or nonchargeable, see, e.g.,\n Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, or the practical prob-\n lems that would arise from the heavy burden facing objecting non-\n members wishing to challenge the union’s actions. Finally, the Abood\n Court’s critical “labor peace” analysis rests on the unsupported em-\n pirical assumption that exclusive representation in the public sector\n depends on the right to collect an agency fee from nonmembers.\n Pp. 8–20.\n    (b) Because of Abood’s questionable foundations, and because Illi-\n nois’ PAs are quite different from full-fledged public employees, this\n Court refuses to extend Abood to the situation here. Pp. 20–29.\n      (1) PAs are much different from public employees. Unlike full-\n fledged public employees, PAs are almost entirely answerable to the\n customers and not to the State, do not enjoy most of the rights and\n benefits that inure to state employees, and are not indemnified by the\n State for claims against them arising from actions taken during the\n course of their employment. Even the scope of collective bargaining\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\non their behalf is sharply limited. Pp. 20–25.\n      (2) Abood’s rationale is based on the assumption that the union\npossesses the full scope of powers and duties generally available un-\nder American labor law. Even the best argument for Abood’s anoma-\nlous approach is a poor fit here. What justifies the agency fee in the\nAbood context is the fact that the State compels the union to promote\nand protect the interests of nonmembers in “negotiating and admin-\nistering a collective-bargaining agreement and representing the in-\nterests of employees in settling disputes and processing grievances.”\nLehnert, supra, at 556. That rationale has little application here,\nwhere Illinois law requires that all PAs receive the same rate of pay\nand the union has no authority with respect to a PA’s grievances\nagainst a customer. Pp. 25–27.\n      (3) Extending Abood’s boundaries to encompass partial public\nemployees would invite problems. State regulations and benefits af-\nfecting such employees exist along a continuum, and it is unclear at\nwhat point, short of full-fledged public employment, Abood should\napply. Under respondents’ view, a host of workers who currently re-\nceive payments from a government entity for some sort of service\nwould become candidates for inclusion within Abood’s reach, and it\nwould be hard to see where to draw the line. Pp. 27–29.\n   (c) Because Abood does not control here, generally applicable First\nAmendment standards apply. Thus, the agency-fee provision here\nmust serve a “ ‘compelling state interes[t] . . . that cannot be achieved\nthrough means significantly less restrictive of associational free-\ndoms.’ ” Knox, supra, at ___. None of the interests that respondents\ncontend are furthered by the agency-fee provision is sufficient.\nPp. 29–34.\n      (1) Their claim that the agency-fee provision promotes “labor\npeace” misses the point. Petitioners do not contend that they have a\nFirst Amendment right to form a rival union or that SEIU–HII has\nno authority to serve as the exclusive bargaining representative.\nThis, along with examples from some federal agencies and many\nstate laws, demonstrates that a union’s status as exclusive bargain-\ning agent and the right to collect an agency fee from nonmembers are\nnot inextricably linked. Features of the Illinois scheme—e.g., PAs do\nnot work together in a common state facility and the union’s role is\nvery restricted—further undermine the “labor peace” argument.\nPp. 31–32.\n      (2) Respondents also argue that the agency-fee provision pro-\nmotes the welfare of PAs, thereby contributing to the Rehabilitation\nProgram’s success. Even assuming that SEIU–HII has been an effec-\ntive advocate, the agency-fee provision cannot be sustained unless\nthe union could not adequately advocate without the receipt of non-\n4                           HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    member agency fees. No such showing has been made. Pp. 32–34.\n       (d) Respondents’ additional arguments for sustaining the Illinois\n    scheme are unconvincing. First, they urge the application of a bal-\n    ancing test derived from Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High\n    School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563. This Court has never\n    viewed Abood and its progeny as based on Pickering balancing. And\n    even assuming that Pickering applies, that case’s balancing test\n    clearly tips in favor of the objecting employees’ First Amendment in-\n    terests. Second, respondents err in contending that a refusal to ex-\n    tend Abood here will call into question this Court’s decisions in Keller\n    v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, and Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.\n    System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, for those decisions fit comforta-\n    bly within the framework applied here.

We\nhold that it does not, and we therefore reverse the judg­\nment of the Court of Appeals.\n                             I\n                             A\n  Millions of Americans, due to age, illness, or injury, are\nunable to live in their own homes without assistance and\nare unable to afford the expense of in-home care. In order\nto prevent these individuals from having to enter a nurs­\ning home or other facility, the federal Medicaid program\nfunds state-run programs that provide in-home services to\nindividuals whose conditions would otherwise require\ninstitutionalization. See 42 U. S. C. §1396n(c)(1). A State\nthat adopts such a program receives federal funds to\ncompensate persons who attend to the daily needs of\nindividuals needing in-home care. Ibid.; see also 42 CFR\n§§440.180, 441.300–441.310 (2013). Almost every State\nhas established such a program. See Dept. of Health and\n2                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHuman Services, Understanding Medicaid Home and\nCommunity Services: A Primer (2010).\n   One of those States is Illinois, which has created the\nIllinois Department of Human Services Home Services\nProgram, known colloquially as the state “Rehabilitation\nProgram.” Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, §2405/3(f ) (West 2012);\n89 Ill. Admin. Code §676.10 (2007). “[D]esigned to prevent\nthe unnecessary institutionalization of individuals who\nmay instead be satisfactorily maintained at home at a\nlesser cost to the State,” §676.10(a), the Rehabilitation\nProgram allows participants to hire a “personal assistant”\nwho provides homecare services tailored to the individual’s\nneeds. Many of these personal assistants are relatives of\nthe person receiving care, and some of them provide care\nin their own homes. See App. 16–18.\n   Illinois law establishes an employer-employee relation­\nship between the person receiving the care and the person\nproviding it. The law states explicitly that the person\nreceiving home care—the “customer”—“shall be the em­\nployer of the [personal assistant].” 89 Ill. Admin. Code\n§676.30(b) (emphasis added). A “personal assistant” is\ndefined as “an individual employed by the customer to\nprovide . . . varied services that have been approved by the\ncustomer’s physician,” §676.30(p) (emphasis added), and\nthe law makes clear that Illinois “shall not have control or\ninput in the employment relationship between the cus­\ntomer and the personal assistants.” §676.10(c).\n   Other provisions of the law emphasize the customer’s\nemployer status. The customer “is responsible for control­\nling all aspects of the employment relationship between\nthe customer and the [personal assistant (or PA)], includ­\ning, without limitation, locating and hiring the PA, train­\ning the PA, directing, evaluating and otherwise supervis­\ning the work performed by the personal assistant,\nimposing . . . disciplinary action against the PA, and ter­\nminating the employment relationship between the cus­\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntomer and the PA.” §676.30(b).1 In general, the customer\n“has complete discretion in which Personal Assistant\nhe/she wishes to hire.” §684.20(b).\n   A customer also controls the contents of the document,\nthe Service Plan, that lists the services that the customer\nwill receive. §684.10(a). No Service Plan may take effect\nwithout the approval of both the customer and the cus­\ntomer’s physician. See §684.10, 684.40, 684.50, 684.75.\nService Plans are highly individualized. The Illinois State\nLabor Relations Board noted in 1985 that “[t]here is no\ntypical employment arrangement here, public or other­\nwise; rather, there simply exists an arrangement whereby\nthe state of Illinois pays individuals . . . to work under the\ndirection and control of private third parties.” Illinois\nDept. of Central Management Serv., No. S–RC–115, 2\nPERI ¶2007, p. VIII–30, (1985), superseded, 2003 Ill.\nLaws p. 1929.\n   While customers exercise predominant control over their\nemployment relationship with personal assistants, the\nState, subsidized by the federal Medicaid program, pays\nthe personal assistants’ salaries. The amount paid varies\ndepending on the services provided, but as a general mat­\nter, it “corresponds to the amount the State would expect\nto pay for the nursing care component of institutionaliza­\ntion if the individual chose institutionalization.” 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code §679.50(a).\n——————\n  1 Although  this regulation states clearly that a customer has complete\ndiscretion with respect to hiring and firing a personal assistant, the\ndissent contends that the State also has the authority to end the\nemployment of a personal assistant whose performance is not satisfac­\ntory. Nothing in the regulations supports this view. Under 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code §677.40(d), the State may stop paying a personal assistant\nif it is found that the assistant does not meet “the standards estab­\nlished by DHS as found at 89 Ill. Adm. Code 686.” These standards are\nthe basic hiring requirements set out in §686.10, see n. 2, infra. Provid­\ning adequate performance after hiring is nowhere mentioned in\n§686.10.\n4                          HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Other than providing compensation, the State’s role is\ncomparatively small. The State sets some basic threshold\nqualifications for employment. See §§686.10(h)(1)–(10).2\n(For example, a personal assistant must have a Social\nSecurity number, must possess basic communication\nskills, and must complete an employment agreement with\nthe customer. §§686.10, 686.20, 686.40.) The State man­\ndates an annual performance review by the customer,\nhelps the customer conduct that review, and mediates\ndisagreements between customers and their personal\nassistants. §686.30. The State suggests certain duties\nthat personal assistants should assume, such as perform­\ning “household tasks,” “shopping,” providing “personal\ncare,” performing “incidental health care tasks,” and\n“monitoring to ensure the health and safety of the cus­\ntomer.” §686.20. In addition, a state employee must “identify\nthe appropriate level of service provider” “based on the\ncustomer’s approval of the initial Service Plan,” §684.20(a)\n(emphasis added), and must sign each customer’s Service\nPlan. §684.10.\n                              B\n  Section 6 of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act\n(PLRA) authorizes state employees to join labor unions\nand to bargain collectively on the terms and conditions of\n——————\n  2 It is true, as the dissent notes, post, at 4, that a personal assistant\n\nmust provide two written or oral references, see §686.10(c), but judging\nthe adequacy of these references is the sole prerogative of the customer.\nSee §676.30(b). And while the regulations say that an applicant must\nhave either previous experience or training, see §686.10(f ), they also\nprovide that a customer has complete discretion to judge the adequacy\nof training and prior experience. See §684.20(b) (the customer has\ncomplete discretion with respect to hiring and training a personal\nassistant). See also §686.10(b) (the customer may hire a minor—even\nunder some circumstances, a person as young as 14); §686.10(f ) (the\ncustomer may hire a personal assistant who was never previously\nemployed so long as the assistant has adequate training); §684.20(b)\n(criminal record check not required).\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

This law\napplies to “[e]mployees of the State and any political sub­\ndivision of the State,” subject to certain exceptions, and it\nprovides for a union to be recognized if it is “designated by\nthe [Public Labor Relations] Board as the representative\nof the majority of public employees in an appropriate unit\n. . . .” §§315/6(a), (c).\n    The PLRA contains an agency-fee provision, i.e., a provi­\nsion under which members of a bargaining unit who do not\nwish to join the union are nevertheless required to pay a\nfee to the union. See Workers v. Mobil Oil Corp., 426 U. S.\n407, 409, n. 1 (1976). Labeled a “fair share” provision, this\nsection of the PLRA provides: “When a collective bargain­\ning agreement is entered into with an exclusive repre­\nsentative, it may include in the agreement a provision\nrequiring employees covered by the agreement who are\nnot members of the organization to pay their proportionate\nshare of the costs of the collective-bargaining process,\ncontract administration and pursuing matters affecting\nwages, hours and conditions of employment.” §315/6(e).\nThis payment is “deducted by the employer from the earn­\nings of the nonmember employees and paid to the em-\nployee organization.” Ibid.\n    In the 1980’s, the Service Employees International\nUnion (SEIU) petitioned the Illinois Labor Relations\nBoard for permission to represent personal assistants\nemployed by customers in the Rehabilitation Program, but\nthe board rebuffed this effort. Illinois Dept. of Central\nManagement Servs., supra, at VIII–30. The board con­\ncluded that “it is clear . . . that [Illinois] does not exercise\nthe type of control over the petitioned-for employees nec­\nessary to be considered, in the collective bargaining con­\ntext envisioned by the [PLRA], their ‘employer’ or, at least,\ntheir sole employer.” Ibid.\n    In March 2003, however, Illinois’ newly elected Gover­\nnor, Rod Blagojevich, circumvented this decision by issu­\n6                     HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning Executive Order 2003–08. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n45a–47a. The order noted the Illinois Labor Relations\nBoard decision but nevertheless called for state recogni­\ntion of a union as the personal assistants’ exclusive repre­\nsentative for the purpose of collective bargaining with the\nState. This was necessary, Gov. Blagojevich declared, so\nthat the State could “receive feedback from the personal\nassistants in order to effectively and efficiently deliver\nhome services.” Id., at 46a. Without such representation,\nthe Governor proclaimed, personal assistants “cannot\neffectively voice their concerns about the organization of\nthe Home Services program, their role in the program, or\nthe terms and conditions of their employment under the\nProgram.” Ibid.\n   Several months later, the Illinois Legislature codified\nthat executive order by amending the PLRA. Pub. Act no.\n93–204, §5, 2003 Ill. Laws p. 1930. While acknowledging\n“the right of the persons receiving services . . . to hire and\nfire personal assistants or supervise them,” the Act de­\nclared personal assistants to be “public employees” of the\nState of Illinois—but “[s]olely for the purposes of coverage\nunder the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act.” Ill. Comp.\nStat., ch. 20, §2405/3(f ). The statute emphasized that\npersonal assistants are not state employees for any other\npurpose, “including but not limited to, purposes of vicari­\nous liability in tort and purposes of statutory retirement\nor health insurance benefits.” Ibid.\n   Following a vote, SEIU Healthcare Illinois & Indiana\n(SEIU–HII) was designated as the personal assistants’\nexclusive representative for purposes of collective bargain­\ning. See App. 23. The union and the State subsequently\nentered into collective-bargaining agreements that require\nall personal assistants who are not union members to pay\na “fair share” of the union dues. Id., at 24–25. These\npayments are deducted directly from the personal assis­\ntants’ Medicaid payments. Ibid. The record in this case\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Id., at 25.\n                              C\n   Three of the petitioners in the case now before us—\nTheresa Riffey, Susan Watts, and Stephanie Yencer­\nPrice—are personal assistants under the Rehabilitation\nProgram. They all provide in-home services to family\nmembers or other individuals suffering from disabilities.3\nSusan Watts, for example, serves as personal assistant for\nher daughter, who requires constant care due to quadri­\nplegic cerebral palsy and other conditions. See App. 18.\n   In 2010, these petitioners filed a putative class action on\nbehalf of all Rehabilitation Program personal assistants in\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District\nof Illinois. See 656 F. 3d 692, 696 (CA7 2011). Their\ncomplaint, which named the Governor and the union as\ndefendants, sought an injunction against enforcement of\nthe fair-share provision and a declaration that the Illinois\nPLRA violates the First Amendment insofar as it requires\npersonal assistants to pay a fee to a union that they do not\nwish to support. Ibid.\n   The District Court dismissed their claims with preju­\ndice, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed in relevant part,\nconcluding that the case was controlled by this Court’s\ndecision in Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. 431 U. S. 209\n(1977). 656 F. 3d, at 698. The Seventh Circuit held that\nIllinois and the customers who receive in-home care are\n“joint employers” of the personal assistants, and the court\nstated that it had “no difficulty concluding that the State\nemploys personal assistants within the meaning of\nAbood.” Ibid.\n   Petitioners sought certiorari. Their petition pointed out\n——————\n   3 The other five petitioners are personal assistants under a similar\n\nIllinois program called the “Disabilities Program.” See, infra, at 39–40,\nand n. 30.\n8                     HARRIS v.

See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 22a. Petitioners also noted that Illinois has enacted\na law that deems “individual maintenance home health\nworkers”—a category that includes registered nurses,\nlicensed practical nurses, and certain therapists who work\nin private homes—to be “public employees” for similar\npurposes.

Id., at 235–236. Two\nTerms ago, in Knox v. Service Employees, 567 U. S. ___\n(2012), we pointed out that Abood is “something of an\nanomaly.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11). “ ‘The primary\npurpose’ of permitting unions to collect fees from non­\nmembers,” we noted, “is ‘to prevent nonmembers from\nfree-riding on the union’s efforts, sharing the employment\nbenefits obtained by the union’s collective bargaining\nwithout sharing the costs incurred.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10) (quoting Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551\nU. S. 177, 181 (2007)). But “[s]uch free-rider arguments\n. . . are generally insufficient to overcome First Amend­\nment objections.” 567 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10–11).\n    For this reason, Abood stands out, but the State of\nIllinois now asks us to sanction what amounts to a very\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsignificant expansion of Abood—so that it applies, not just\nto full-fledged public employees, but also to others who are\ndeemed to be public employees solely for the purpose of\nunionization and the collection of an agency fee. Faced\nwith this argument, we begin by examining the path that\nled to this Court’s decision in Abood.\n                             A\n   The starting point was Railway Employes v. Hanson,\n351 U. S. 225 (1956), a case in which the First Amend­\nment was barely mentioned. The dispute in Hanson re­\nsulted from an amendment to the Railway Labor Act\n(RLA). Id., at 229, 232. As originally enacted in 1926, the\nAct did not permit a collective-bargaining agreement to\nrequire employees to join or make any payments to a\nunion. See Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 750 (1961).\nAt that time and for many years thereafter, there was “a\nstrong and long-standing tradition of voluntary unionism\non the part of the standard rail unions.” Ibid.\n   Eventually, however, the view of the unions changed.\nSee id., at 760–761. The RLA’s framework for resolving\nlabor disputes “is more complex than that of any other\nindustry,” id., at 755, and amendments enacted in 1934\nincreased the financial burden on unions by creating the\n36-member National Railroad Adjustment Board, one-half\nof whose members were appointed and paid by the unions.\nId., at 759–760. In seeking authorization to enter into\nunion-shop agreements, i.e., agreements requiring all\nemployees to join a union and thus pay union dues, see Oil\nWorkers, 426 U. S., at 409, n. 1, the unions’ principal\nargument “was based on their role in this regulatory\nframework.” Street, 367 U. S., at 761. A union spokesman\nargued that the financial burdens resulting from the Act’s\nunique and complex scheme justified union-shop provi­\nsions in order to provide the unions with needed dues.\nIbid.\n10                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  These arguments were successful, and the Act was\namended in 1951 to permit a railroad and a union to enter\ninto an agreement containing a union-shop provision.\nThis amendment brought the Act into conflict with the\nlaws of States that guaranteed the “right to work” and\nthereby outlawed the union shop. Nebraska, the setting of\nHanson, was one such State. 351 U. S., at 228.\n  In Hanson, the Union Pacific Railroad Company and its\nunionized workers entered into a collective-bargaining\nagreement that contained a provision requiring employ­\nees, “as a condition of their continued employment,” to join\nand remain members of the union. Id., at 227. Employees\nwho did not want to join the union brought suit in state\ncourt, contending that the union-shop provision violated a\nprovision of the Nebraska Constitution banning adverse\nemployment actions “ ‘because of refusal to join or affiliate\nwith a labor organization.’ ” Id., at 228 (quoting Neb.\nConst., Art. XV, §13). The employer countered that the\nRLA trumped the Nebraska provision, but the Nebraska\ncourts agreed with the employees and struck down the\nunion-shop agreement.\n  When the case reached this Court, the primary issue\nwas whether the provision of the RLA that authorized\nunion-shop agreements was “germane to the exercise of\npower under the Commerce Clause.” 351 U. S., at 234–\n235. In an opinion by Justice Douglas, the Court held that\nthis provision represented a permissible regulation of\ncommerce. The Court reasoned that the challenged provi­\nsion “ ‘stabilized labor-management relations’ ” and thus\nfurthered “ ‘industrial peace.’ ” Id., at 233–234.\n  The employees also raised what amounted to a facial\nconstitutional challenge to the same provision of the RLA.\nThe employees claimed that a “union shop agreement\nforces men into ideological and political associations which\nviolate their right to freedom of conscience, freedom of\nassociation, and freedom of thought protected by the Bill\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof Rights.” Id., at 236. But because the lawsuit had been\nfiled shortly after the collective-bargaining agreement was\napproved, the record contained no evidence that the union\nhad actually engaged in political or ideological activities.4\n   The Hanson Court dismissed the objecting employees’\nFirst Amendment argument with a single sentence. The\nCourt wrote: “On the present record, there is no more an\ninfringement or impairment of First Amendment rights\nthan there would be in the case of a lawyer who by state\nlaw is required to be a member of an integrated bar.” Id.,\nat 238.\n   This explanation was remarkable for two reasons. First,\nthe Court had never previously held that compulsory\nmembership in and the payment of dues to an integrated\nbar was constitutional, and the constitutionality of such a\nrequirement was hardly a foregone conclusion. Indeed,\nthat issue did not reach the Court until five years later,\nand it produced a plurality opinion and four separate\nwritings. See Lathrop v. Donohue, 367 U. S. 820 (1961)\n(plurality opinion).5\n   Second, in his Lathrop dissent, Justice Douglas, the\nauthor of Hanson, came to the conclusion that the First\nAmendment did not permit compulsory membership in an\nintegrated bar. See 367 U. S., at 878–880. The analogy\ndrawn in Hanson, he wrote, fails. “Once we approve this\nmeasure,” he warned, “we sanction a device where men\nand women in almost any profession or calling can be at\n\n——————\n   4 The employees’ First Amendment claim necessarily raised the ques­\n\ntion of governmental action, since the First Amendment does not\nrestrict private conduct, and the Hanson Court, in a brief passage,\nconcluded that governmental action was present. This was so, the\nCourt reasoned, because the union-shop provision of the RLA took away\na right that employees had previously enjoyed under state law. 351\nU. S., at 232–233.\n   5 A related question arose in Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1\n\n(1990), which we discuss infra, at 37–38.\n12                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nleast partially regimented behind causes which they op­\npose.” 367 U. S., at 884. He continued:\n     “I look on the Hanson case as a narrow exception to be\n     closely confined. Unless we so treat it, we practically\n     give carte blanche to any legislature to put at least\n     professional people into goose-stepping brigades.\n     Those brigades are not compatible with the First\n     Amendment.” Id., at 884–885 (footnote omitted).\n  The First Amendment analysis in Hanson was thin, and\nthe Court’s resulting First Amendment holding was nar­\nrow. As the Court later noted, “all that was held in Han­\nson was that [the RLA] was constitutional in its bare\nauthorization of union-shop contracts requiring workers to\ngive ‘financial support’ to unions legally authorized to act\nas their collective bargaining agents.” Street, 367 U. S., at\n749 (emphasis added). The Court did not suggest that\n“industrial peace” could justify a law that “forces men into\nideological and political associations which violate their\nright to freedom of conscience, freedom of association, and\nfreedom of thought,” or a law that forces a person to “con­\nform to [a union’s] ideology.” Hanson, supra, at 236–237.\nThe RLA did not compel such results, and the record in\nHanson did not show that this had occurred.\n                             B\n  Five years later, in Street, supra, the Court considered\nanother case in which workers objected to a union shop.\nEmployees of the Southern Railway System raised a First\nAmendment challenge, contending that a substantial part\nof the money that they were required to pay to the union\nwas used to support political candidates and causes with\nwhich they disagreed. A Georgia court enjoined the en­\nforcement of the union-shop provision and entered judg­\nment for the dissenting employees in the amount of the\npayments that they had been forced to make to the union.\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court affirmed. Id., at 742–745.\n   Reviewing the State Supreme Court’s decision, this\nCourt recognized that the case presented constitutional\nquestions “of the utmost gravity,” id., at 749, but the\nCourt found it unnecessary to reach those questions.\nInstead, the Court construed the RLA “as not vesting the\nunions with unlimited power to spend exacted money.”\nId., at 768. Specifically, the Court held, the Act “is to be\nconstrued to deny the unions, over an employee’s objec­\ntion, the power to use his exacted funds to support politi­\ncal causes which he opposes.” Id., at 768–769.\n   Having construed the RLA to contain this restriction,\nthe Street Court then went on to discuss the remedies\navailable for employees who objected to the use of union\nfunds for political causes. The Court suggested two: The\ndissenting employees could be given a refund of the por­\ntion of their dues spent by the union for political or ideo­\nlogical purposes, or they could be given a refund of the\nportion spent on those political purposes that they had\nadvised the union they disapproved.6 Id., at 774–775.\n   Justice Black, writing in dissent, objected to the Court’s\nsuggested remedies, and he accurately predicted that the\nCourt’s approach would lead to serious practical problems.\nId., at 796–797. That approach, he wrote, while “very\nlucrative to special masters, accountants and lawyers,”\nwould do little for “the individual workers whose First\nAmendment freedoms have been flagrantly violated.” Id.,\nat 796. He concluded:\n     “Unions composed of a voluntary membership, like all\n     other voluntary groups, should be free in this country\n     to fight in the public forum to advance their own\n——————\n  6 Only  four Justices fully agreed with this approach, but a fifth, Jus­\ntice Douglas, went along due to “the practical problem of mustering five\nJustices for a judgment in this case.” Id., at 778–779 (concurring\nopinion).\n14                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     causes, to promote their choice of candidates and par­\n     ties and to work for the doctrines or the laws they fa­\n     vor. But to the extent that Government steps in to\n     force people to help espouse the particular causes of a\n     group, that group—whether composed of railroad\n     workers or lawyers—loses its status as a voluntary\n     group.” Ibid.\n   Justice Frankfurter, joined by Justice Harlan, also\ndissented, arguing that the Court’s remedy was conceptu­\nally flawed because a union may further the objectives of\nmembers by political means. See id., at 813–815. He\nnoted, for example, that reports from the AFL–CIO Execu­\ntive Council “emphasize that labor’s participation in urg­\ning legislation and candidacies is a major one.” Id., at 813.\nIn light of “the detailed list of national and international\nproblems on which the AFL–CIO speaks,” he opined, “it\nseems rather naive” to believe “that economic and political\nconcerns are separable.” Id., at 814.\n                               C\n   This brings us to Abood, which, unlike Hanson and\nStreet, involved a public-sector collective-bargaining\nagreement. The Detroit Federation of Teachers served “as\nthe exclusive representative of teachers employed by the\nDetroit Board of Education.” 431 U. S., at 211–212. The\ncollective-bargaining agreement between the union and\nthe board contained an agency-shop clause requiring every\nteacher to “pay the Union a service charge equal to the\nregular dues required of Union members.” Id., at 212. A\nputative class of teachers sued to invalidate this clause.\nAsserting that “they opposed collective bargaining in the\npublic sector,” the plaintiffs argued that “ ‘a substantial\npart’ ” of their dues would be used to fund union “ ‘activi­\nties and programs which are economic, political, profes­\nsional, scientific and religious in nature of which Plaintiffs\ndo not approve, and in which they will have no voice.’ ”\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 212–213.\n   This Court treated the First Amendment issue as largely\nsettled by Hanson and Street. 431 U. S., at 217, 223.\nThe Court acknowledged that Street was resolved as a\nmatter of statutory construction without reaching any\nconstitutional issues, 431 U. S., at 220, and the Court\nrecognized that forced membership and forced contribu­\ntions impinge on free speech and associational rights, id.,\nat 223. But the Court dismissed the objecting teachers’\nconstitutional arguments with this observation: “[T]he\njudgment clearly made in Hanson and Street is that such\ninterference as exists is constitutionally justified by the\nlegislative assessment of the important contribution of the\nunion shop to the system of labor relations established by\nCongress.” Id., at 222.\n   The Abood Court understood Hanson and Street to have\nupheld union-shop agreements in the private sector based\non two primary considerations: the desirability of “labor\npeace” and the problem of “ ‘free riders[hip].’ ” 431 U. S., at\n220–222, 224.\n   The Court thought that agency-shop provisions promote\nlabor peace because the Court saw a close link between\nsuch provisions and the “principle of exclusive union rep­\nresentation.” Id., at 220. This principle, the Court ex­\nplained, “prevents inter-union rivalries from creating\ndissension within the work force and eliminating the\nadvantages to the employee of collectivization.” Id., at\n220–221. In addition, the Court noted, the “designation of\na single representative avoids the confusion that would\nresult from attempting to enforce two or more agreements\nspecifying different terms and conditions of employment.”\nId., at 220. And the Court pointed out that exclusive\nrepresentation “frees the employer from the possibility of\nfacing conflicting demands from different unions, and\npermits the employer and a single union to reach agree­\nments and settlements that are not subject to attack from\n16                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrival labor organizations.” Id., at 221.\n  Turning to the problem of free ridership, Abood noted\nthat a union must “ ‘fairly and equitably . . . represent all\nemployees’ ” regardless of union membership, and the\nCourt wrote as follows: The “union-shop arrangement has\nbeen thought to distribute fairly the cost of these activities\namong those who benefit, and it counteracts the incentive\nthat employees might otherwise have to become ‘free\nriders’ to refuse to contribute to the union while obtaining\nbenefits of union representation.” Id., at 221–222.\n  The plaintiffs in Abood argued that Hanson and Street\nshould not be given much weight because they did not\narise in the public sector, and the Court acknowledged\nthat public-sector bargaining is different from private­\nsector bargaining in some notable respects. 431 U. S., at\n227–228. For example, although public and private em­\nployers both desire to keep costs down, the Court recog­\nnized that a public employer “lacks an important disci­\npline against agreeing to increases in labor costs that in a\nmarket system would require price increases.” Id., at 228.\nThe Court also noted that “decisionmaking by a public\nemployer is above all a political process” undertaken by\npeople “ultimately responsible to the electorate.” Ibid.\nThus, whether a public employer accedes to a union’s\ndemands, the Court wrote, “will depend upon a blend of\npolitical ingredients,” thereby giving public employees\n“more influence in the decisionmaking process that is\npossessed by employees similarly organized in the private\nsector.” Ibid. But despite these acknowledged differences\nbetween private- and public-sector bargaining, the Court\ntreated Hanson and Street as essentially controlling.\n  Instead of drawing a line between the private and public\nsectors, the Abood Court drew a line between, on the one\nhand, a union’s expenditures for “collective-bargaining,\ncontract administration, and grievance-adjustment pur­\nposes,” 431 U. S., at 232, and, on the other, expenditures\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor political or ideological purposes. Id., at 236.\n                              D\n   The Abood Court’s analysis is questionable on several\ngrounds. Some of these were noted or apparent at or\nbefore the time of the decision, but several have become\nmore evident and troubling in the years since then.\n   The Abood Court seriously erred in treating Hanson and\nStreet as having all but decided the constitutionality of\ncompulsory payments to a public-sector union. As we have\nexplained, Street was not a constitutional decision at all,\nand Hanson disposed of the critical question in a single,\nunsupported sentence that its author essentially aban­\ndoned a few years later. Surely a First Amendment issue\nof this importance deserved better treatment.\n   The Abood Court fundamentally misunderstood the\nholding in Hanson, which was really quite narrow. As the\nCourt made clear in Street, “all that was held in Hanson\nwas that [the RLA] was constitutional in its bare authori­\nzation of union-shop contracts requiring workers to give\n‘financial support’ to unions legally authorized to act as\ntheir collective bargaining agents.” 367 U. S., at 749\n(emphasis added). In Abood, on the other hand, the State\nof Michigan did more than simply authorize the imposition\nof an agency fee. A state instrumentality, the Detroit\nBoard of Education, actually imposed that fee. This pre­\nsented a very different question.\n   Abood failed to appreciate the difference between the\ncore union speech involuntarily subsidized by dissenting\npublic-sector employees and the core union speech invol­\nuntarily funded by their counterparts in the private sec­\ntor. In the public sector, core issues such as wages, pen­\nsions, and benefits are important political issues, but that\nis generally not so in the private sector. In the years since\nAbood, as state and local expenditures on employee wages\nand benefits have mushroomed, the importance of the\n18                       HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndifference between bargaining in the public and private\nsectors has been driven home.7\n   Abood failed to appreciate the conceptual difficulty of\ndistinguishing in public-sector cases between union ex­\npenditures that are made for collective-bargaining pur­\nposes and those that are made to achieve political ends. In\nthe private sector, the line is easier to see. Collective\nbargaining concerns the union’s dealings with the em-\nployer; political advocacy and lobbying are directed at the\ngovernment. But in the public sector, both collective­\nbargaining and political advocacy and lobbying are di­\nrected at the government.\n   Abood does not seem to have anticipated the magnitude\nof the practical administrative problems that would result\nin attempting to classify public-sector union expenditures\nas either “chargeable” (in Abood’s terms, expenditures\nfor “collective-bargaining, contract administration, and\ngrievance-adjustment purposes,” id., at 232) or noncharge-\nable (i.e., expenditures for political or ideological purposes,\nid., at 236). In the years since Abood, the Court has strug­\ngled repeatedly with this issue. See Ellis v. Railway Clerks,\n466 U. S. 435 (1984); Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292\n(1986); Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507\n(1991); Locke v. Karass, 555 U. S. 207 (2009). In Lehnert,\nthe Court held that “chargeable activities must (1) be\n‘germane’ to collective-bargaining activity; (2) be justified\nby the government’s vital policy interest in labor peace\nand avoiding ‘free riders’; and (3) not significantly add to\nthe burdening of free speech that is inherent in the allow­\nance of an agency or union shop.” 500 U. S., at 519. But\nas noted in JUSTICE SCALIA’s dissent in that case, “each\n——————\n   7 Recent experience has borne out this concern.   See DiSalvo, The\nTrouble with Public Sector Unions, National Affairs No. 5, p. 15 (2010)\n(“In Illinois, for example, public-sector unions have helped create a\nsituation in which the state’s pension funds report a liability of more\nthan $100 billion, at least 50% of it unfunded”).\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\none of the three ‘prongs’ of the test involves a substantial\njudgment call (What is ‘germane’? What is ‘justified’?\nWhat is a ‘significant’ additional burden).” Id., at 551\n(opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in\npart).\n    Abood likewise did not foresee the practical problems\nthat would face objecting nonmembers. Employees who\nsuspect that a union has improperly put certain expenses\nin the “germane” category must bear a heavy burden if\nthey wish to challenge the union’s actions. “[T]he onus is\non the employees to come up with the resources to mount\nthe legal challenge in a timely fashion,” Knox, 567 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 19) (citing Lehnert, supra, at 513), and\nlitigating such cases is expensive. Because of the open­\nended nature of the Lehnert test, classifying particular\ncategories of expenses may not be straightforward. See\nJibson v. Michigan Ed. Assn.–NEA, 30 F. 3d 723, 730\n(CA6 1994)). And although Hudson required that a un­\nion’s books be audited, auditors do not themselves review\nthe correctness of a union’s categorization. See Knox,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 18–19) (citing Andrews v. Educa­\ntion Assn. of Cheshire, 829 F. 2d 335, 340 (CA2 1987)).\nSee also American Federation of Television and Recording\nArtists, Portland Local, 327 N. L. R. B. 474, 477 (1999) (“It\nis settled that determinations concerning whether particu­\nlar expenditures are chargeable are legal determinations\nwhich are outside the expertise of the auditor. Thus, as\nwe have stated, the function of the auditor is to verify that\nthe expenditures that the union claims it made were in\nfact made for the purposes claimed, not to pass on the\ncorrectness of the union’s allocation of expenditures to the\nchargeable and nonchargeable categories”); California\nSaw and Knife Works, 320 N. L. R.

That function does not require that the\nauditor make a legal decision as to the appropriateness of\nthe allocation of expenses to the chargeable and non­\nchargeable categories”).\n  Finally, a critical pillar of the Abood Court’s analysis\nrests on an unsupported empirical assumption, namely,\nthat the principle of exclusive representation in the public\nsector is dependent on a union or agency shop. As we will\nexplain, see infra, at 31–34, this assumption is unwar­\nranted.\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n   Despite all this, the State of Illinois now asks us to\napprove a very substantial expansion of Abood’s reach.\nAbood involved full-fledged public employees, but in this\ncase, the status of the personal assistants is much differ­\nent. The Illinois Legislature has taken pains to specify\nthat personal assistants are public employees for one\npurpose only: collective bargaining. For all other pur­\nposes, Illinois regards the personal assistants as private­\nsector employees. This approach has important practical\nconsequences.\n   For one thing, the State’s authority with respect to these\ntwo groups is vastly different. In the case of full-fledged\npublic employees, the State establishes all of the duties\nimposed on each employee, as well as all of the qualifica­\ntions needed for each position.

S. ____ (2014)          21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nimposes corrective measures if appropriate. If a state\nemployee’s performance is deficient, the State may dis­\ncharge the employee in accordance with whatever proce­\ndures are required by law.\n   With respect to the personal assistants involved in this\ncase, the picture is entirely changed. The job duties of\npersonal assistants are specified in their individualized\nService Plans, which must be approved by the customer\nand the customer’s physician.         89 Ill. Admin. Code\n§684.10. Customers have complete discretion to hire any\npersonal assistant who meets the meager basic qualifica­\ntions that the State prescribes in §686.10. See §676.30(b)\n(the customer “is responsible for controlling all aspects of\nthe employment relationship between the customer and\nthe [personal assistant], including, without limitation,\nlocating and hiring the [personal assistant]” (emphasis\nadded)); §684.20(b) (“complete discretion in which Per-\nsonal Assistant [the customer] wishes to hire” subject to\nbaseline eligibility requirements).\n   Customers supervise their personal assistants on a daily\nbasis, and no provision of the Illinois statute or imple­\nmenting regulations gives the State the right to enter the\nhome in which the personal assistant is employed for the\npurpose of checking on the personal assistant’s job per­\nformance. Cf. §676.20(b) (customer controls “without\nlimitation . . . supervising the work performed by the\n[personal assistant], imposing . . . disciplinary action\nagainst the [personal assistant]”). And while state law\nmandates an annual review of each personal assistant’s\nwork, that evaluation is also controlled by the customer.\n§§686.10(k), 686.30. A state counselor is assigned to assist\nthe customer in performing the review but has no power to\noverride the customer’s evaluation. See ibid. Nor do the\nregulations empower the State to discharge a personal\nassistant for substandard performance. See n. 1, supra.\nDischarge, like hiring, is entirely in the hands of the cus­\n22                       HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntomer. See §676.30.\n   Consistent with this scheme, under which personal\nassistants are almost entirely answerable to the customers\nand not to the State, Illinois withholds from personal\nassistants most of the rights and benefits enjoyed by full­\nfledged state employees. As we have noted already, state\nlaw explicitly excludes personal assistants from statutory\nretirement and health insurance benefits. Ill. Comp. Stat.,\nch. 20, §2405/3(f ). It also excludes personal assistants\nfrom group life insurance and certain other employee\nbenefits provided under the State Employees Group In­\nsurance Act of 1971. Ibid. (“Personal assistants shall not\nbe covered by the State Employees Group Insurance Act of\n1971”). And the State “does not provide paid vacation,\nholiday, or sick leave” to personal assistants. 89 Ill. Ad­\nmin. Code §686.10(h)(7).\n   Personal assistants also appear to be ineligible for a\nhost of benefits under a variety of other state laws, includ­\ning the State Employee Vacation Time Act (see Ill. Stat.,\nch. 5, §360/1); the State Employee Health Savings Account\nLaw (see Ill. Stat., ch. 5, §377/10–1); the State Employee\nJob Sharing Act (see Ill. Stat., ch. 5, §380/0.01); the State\nEmployee Indemnification Act (see Ill. Stat., ch. 5, §350/2);\nand the Sick Leave Bank Act. See Ill. Stat., ch. 5, §400/1.\nPersonal assistants are apparently not entitled to the\nprotection that the Illinois Whistleblower Act provides for\nfull-fledged state employees. See Ill. Stat., ch. 740, §174/1.\nAnd it likewise appears that personal assistants are shut\nout of many other state employee programs and benefits.\nThe Illinois Department of Central Management Services\nlists many such programs and benefits, including a de­\nferred compensation program, full worker’s compensation\nprivileges,8 behavioral health programs, a program that\n——————\n  8 Under §686.10(h)(9), a personal assistant “may apply for Workers'\n\nCompensation benefits through [the State] . . . however, . . . the cus­\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, §2405/3(f ).\n   Just as the State denies personal assistants most of the\nrights and benefits enjoyed by full-fledged state workers,\nthe State does not assume responsibility for actions taken\nby personal assistants during the course of their employ­\nment. The governing statute explicitly disclaims “vicari­\nous liability in tort.” Ibid. So if a personal assistant steals\nfrom a customer, neglects a customer, or abuses a customer,\nthe State washes its hands.\n   Illinois deems personal assistants to be state employees\nfor one purpose only, collective bargaining,10 but the scope\nof bargaining that may be conducted on their behalf is\nsharply limited. Under the governing Illinois statute,\ncollective bargaining can occur only for “terms and condi­\ntions of employment that are within the State’s control.”\nIll. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, §2405/3(f ). That is not very much.\n   As an illustration, consider the subjects of mandatory\nbargaining under federal and state labor law that are out\n\n——————\ntomer, not DHS, is the employer for these purposes.”\n  9 See www2.illinois.gov/cms/Employees/benefits/StateEmployee/Pages/\n\ndefault.\n  10 What is significant is not the label that the State assigns to the\n\npersonal assistants but the substance of their relationship to the\ncustomers and the State. Our decision rests in no way on state-law\nlabels. Cf. post, at 10. Indeed, it is because the First Amendment’s\nmeaning does not turn on state-law labels that we refuse to allow the\nstate to make a nonemployee a full-fledged employee “[s]olely for\npurposes of coverage under the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act,” Ill.\nComp.

S. ____ (2014)         25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nimplications for present purposes. Abood’s rationale,\nwhatever its strengths and weaknesses, is based on the\nassumption that the union possesses the full scope of\npowers and duties generally available under American\nlabor law. Under the Illinois scheme now before us, how­\never, the union’s powers and duties are sharply circum­\nscribed, and as a result, even the best argument for the\n“extraordinary power” that Abood allows a union to wield,\nsee Davenport, 551 U. S., at 184, is a poor fit.\n  In our post-Abood cases involving public-sector agency­\nfee issues, Abood has been a given, and our task has been\nto attempt to understand its rationale and to apply it in a\nway that is consistent with that rationale. In that vein,\nAbood’s reasoning has been described as follows. The\nmere fact that nonunion members benefit from union\nspeech is not enough to justify an agency fee because\n“private speech often furthers the interests of nonspeak­\ners, and that does not alone empower the state to compel\nthe speech to be paid for.” Lehnert, 500 U. S., at 556\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.). What justifies the agency fee, the\nargument goes, is the fact that the State compels the\nunion to promote and protect the interests of nonmembers.\nIbid. Specifically, the union must not discriminate be­\ntween members and nonmembers in “negotiating and\nadministering a collective-bargaining agreement and\nrepresenting the interests of employees in settling dis­\nputes and processing grievances.” Ibid. This means that\nthe union “cannot, for example, negotiate particularly high\nwage increases for its members in exchange for accepting\nno increases for others.” Ibid. And it has the duty to\nprovide equal and effective representation for nonmem­\nbers in grievance proceedings, see Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann.,\nch. 5, §§315/6, 315/8, an undertaking that can be very\ninvolved. See, e.g., SEIU: Member Resources, available at\nwww.seiu.or /a/members /disputes-and-grievances-rights­\nprocedures-and-best-practices.php (detailing the steps\n26                        HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninvolved in adjusting grievances).\n   This argument has little force in the situation now\nbefore us. Illinois law specifies that personal assistants\n“shall be paid at the hourly rate set by law,” see 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code §686.40(a), and therefore the union cannot\nbe in the position of having to sacrifice higher pay for its\nmembers in order to protect the nonmembers whom it is\nobligated to represent. And as for the adjustment of\ngrievances, the union’s authority and responsibilities are\nnarrow, as we have seen. The union has no authority with\nrespect to any grievances that a personal assistant may\nhave with a customer, and the customer has virtually\ncomplete control over a personal assistant’s work.\n   The union’s limited authority in this area has important\npractical implications. Suppose, for example that a cus­\ntomer fires a personal assistant because the customer\nwrongly believes that the assistant stole a fork. Or sup­\npose that a personal assistant is discharged because the\nassistant shows no interest in the customer’s favorite\ndaytime soaps. Can the union file a grievance on behalf of\nthe assistant? The answer is no.\n   It is true that Illinois law requires a collective­\nbargaining agreement to “contain a grievance resolution\nprocedure which shall apply to all employees in the bar­\ngaining unit,” Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 5, §315/8, but in the\nsituation here, this procedure appears to relate solely to\nany grievance that a personal assistant may have with the\nState,17 not with the customer for whom the personal\n——————\n  17 Under  the current collective-bargaining agreement, a “grievance” is\n“a dispute regarding the meaning or implementation of a specific\nprovision brought by the Union or a Personal Assistant.” App. 51; see\nalso id., at 51–54. “Neither the Union nor the Personal Assistant can\ngrieve the hiring or termination of the Personal Assistant, reduction in\nthe number of hours worked by the Personal Assistant or assigned to\nthe Customer, and/or any action taken by the Customer.” Id., at 51.\nThat apparently limits the union’s role in grievance adjustments to the\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    27\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nassistant works.18\n                            2\n   Because of Abood’s questionable foundations, and be­\ncause the personal assistants are quite different from full­\nfledged public employees, we refuse to extend Abood to the\nnew situation now before us.19 Abood itself has clear\nboundaries; it applies to public employees. Extending\nthose boundaries to encompass partial-public employees,\nquasi-public employees, or simply private employees\n——————\nState’s failure to perform its duties under the collective-bargaining\nagreement, e.g., if the State were to issue an incorrect paycheck, the\nunion could bring a grievance. See id., at 48\n   18 Contrary to the dissent’s argument, post, at 10–11, the scope of the\n\nunion’s bargaining authority has an important bearing on the question\nwhether Abood should be extended to the situation now before us. As\nwe have explained, the best argument that can be mounted in support\nof Abood is based on the fact that a union, in serving as the exclusive\nrepresentative of all the employees in a bargaining unit, is required by\nlaw to engage in certain activities that benefit nonmembers and that\nthe union would not undertake if it did not have a legal obligation to do\nso. But where the law withholds from the union the authority to\nengage in most of those activities, the argument for Abood is weakened.\nHere, the dissent does not claim that the union’s approach to negotia­\ntions on wages or benefits would be any different if it were not required\nto negotiate on behalf of the nonmembers as well as members. And\nthere is no dispute that the law does not require the union to undertake\nthe burden of representing personal assistants with respect to their\ngrievances with customers; on the contrary, the law entirely excludes\nthe union from that process. The most that the dissent can identify is\nthe union’s obligation to represent nonmembers regarding grievances\nwith the State, but since most aspects of the personal assistants’ work\nis controlled entirely by the customers, this obligation is relatively\nslight. It bears little resemblance to the obligation imposed on the\nunion in Abood.\n   19 It is therefore unnecessary for us to reach petitioners’ argument\n\nthat Abood should be overruled, and the dissent’s extended discussion\nof stare decisis is beside the point. Cf. Stoneridge Investment Partners,\nLLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 164–166 (2008) (declining\nto extend the “implied” right of action under §10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act “beyond its present boundaries”).\n28                        HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwould invite problems. Consider a continuum, ranging, on\nthe one hand, from full-fledged state employees to, on the\nother hand, individuals who follow a common calling and\nbenefit from advocacy or lobbying conducted by a group to\nwhich they do not belong and pay no dues. A State may\nnot force every person who benefits from this group’s\nefforts to make payments to the group. See Lehnert, 500\nU. S., at 556 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But what if regula­\ntion of this group is increased? What if the Federal Gov­\nernment or a State begins to provide or increases subsidies\nin this area? At what point, short of the point at which\nthe individuals in question become full-fledged state em­\nployees, should Abood apply?\n   If respondents’ and the dissent’s views were adopted, a\nhost of workers who receive payments from a governmen­\ntal entity for some sort of service would be candidates for\ninclusion within Abood’s reach. Medicare-funded home\nhealth employees may be one such group. See Brief for\nPetitioners 51; 42 U. S. C. §1395x(m); 42 CFR §424.22(a).\nThe same goes for adult foster care providers in Oregon\n(Ore. Rev. Stat. §443.733 (2013)) and Washington (Wash.\nRev. Code §41.56.029 (2012)) and certain workers under\nthe federal Child Care and Development Fund programs\n(45 CFR §98.2).\n   If we allowed Abood to be extended to those who are not\nfull-fledged public employees, it would be hard to see just\nwhere to draw the line,20 and we therefore confine Abood’s\n——————\n   20 The dissent suggests that the concept of joint employment already\n\nsupplies a clear line of demarcation, see post, at 8–9, but absent a clear\nstatutory definition, employer status is generally determined based on\na variety of factors that often do not provide a clear answer.

S., at ___ (slip op. at 8–9); see also, e.g., R.A.V. v. St.\nPaul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992); Riley v. National Federa­\ntion of Blind of N.C., 487 U.

And “com­\npelled funding of the speech of other private speakers or\ngroups” presents the same dangers as compelled speech.\nKnox, supra, at ___ (slip op. at 9). As a result, we ex­\nplained in Knox that an agency-fee provision imposes “a\n‘significant impingement on First Amendment rights,’ ”\nand this cannot be tolerated unless it passes “exacting\nFirst Amendment scrutiny.” 567 U. S., at ___ (slip op. at\n9–10).\n   In Knox, we considered specific features of an agency­\nshop agreement—allowing a union to impose upon non­\nmembers a special assessment or dues increase without\nproviding notice and without obtaining the nonmembers’\n——————\ncontexts. What matters here is whether the relationship between the\nState and the personal assistants is sufficient to bring this case within\nAbood’s reach.\n  21 The dissent claims that our refusal to extend Abood to the Rehabili­\n\ntation Program personal assistants produces a “perverse result” by\npenalizing the State for giving customers extensive control over the\ncare they receive. Post, at 12. But it is not at all perverse to recognize\nthat a State may exercise more control over its full-fledged employees\nthan it may over those who are not full-fledged state employees or are\nprivately employed.\n30                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naffirmative agreement—and we held that these features\ncould not even satisfy the standard employed in United\nStates v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405, 415 (2001),\nwhere we struck down a provision that compelled the\nsubsidization of commercial speech. We did not suggest,\nhowever, that the compelled speech in Knox was like the\ncommercial speech in United Foods. On the contrary, we\nobserved that “[t]he subject of the speech at issue [in\nUnited Foods]—promoting the sale of mushrooms—was\nnot one that is likely to stir the passions of many, but the\nmundane commercial nature of that speech only high­\nlights the importance of our analysis and our holding.”\nKnox, supra, at ___ (slip op. at 9).\n   While the features of the agency-fee provision in Knox\ncould not meet even the commercial-speech standard\nemployed in United Foods, it is apparent that the speech\ncompelled in this case is not commercial speech. Our\nprecedents define commercial speech as “speech that does\nno more than propose a commercial transaction,” United\nFoods, supra, at 409 (citing Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v.\nVirginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S.\n748, 761–762 (1976)), and the union speech in question in\nthis case does much more than that. As a consequence,\nit is arguable that the United Foods standard is too\npermissive.\n                                 B\n   For present purposes, however, no fine parsing of levels\nof First Amendment scrutiny is needed because the agency­\nfee provision here cannot satisfy even the test used in\nKnox. Specifically, this provision does not serve a “ ‘com­\npelling state interes[t] . . . that cannot be achieved through\nmeans significantly less restrictive of associational free­\ndoms.’ ” Knox, supra, at ___ (slip op. at 10) (quoting Rob­\nerts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623 (1984)).\nRespondents contend that the agency-fee provision in this\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Nor do they challenge\nthe authority of the SEIU–HII to serve as the exclusive\nrepresentative of all the personal assistants in bargaining\nwith the State. All they seek is the right not to be\nforced to contribute to the union, with which they broadly\ndisagree.\n   A union’s status as exclusive bargaining agent and the\nright to collect an agency fee from non-members are not\ninextricably linked. For example, employees in some\nfederal agencies may choose a union to serve as the exclu­\nsive bargaining agent for the unit, but no employee is\nrequired to join the union or to pay any union fee. Under\nfederal law, in agencies in which unionization is permit­\nted, “[e]ach employee shall have the right to form, join, or\nassist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such\nactivity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and\neach employee shall be protected in the exercise of such\nright.” 5 U. S. C. §7102 (emphasis added).22\n   Moreover, even if the agency fee provision at issue here\nwere tied to the union’s status as exclusive bargaining\nagents, features of the Illinois scheme would still under­\nmine the argument that the agency fee plays an important\nrole in maintaining labor peace. For one thing, any threat\nto labor peace is diminished because the personal assis­\n\n——————\n  22 A similar statute adopts the same rule specifically as to the U. S.\n\nPostal Service. See 39 U. S. C. §1209(c).\n32                       HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntants do not work together in a common state facility but\ninstead spend all their time in private homes, either the\ncustomers’ or their own. Cf. Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local\nEducators’ Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 51 (1983) (“[E]xclusion of\nthe rival union may reasonably be considered a means of\ninsuring labor-peace within the schools”). Federal labor\nlaw reflects the fact that the organization of household\nworkers like the personal assistants does not further the\ninterest of labor peace. “[A]ny individual employed . . . in\nthe domestic service of any family or person at his home”\nis excluded from coverage under the National Labor Rela­\ntions Act. See 29 U. S. C. §152(3).\n   The union’s very restricted role under the Illinois law\nis also significant. Since the union is largely limited to\npetitioning the State for greater pay and benefits, the\nspecter of conflicting demands by personal assistants is\nlessened. And of course, State officials must deal on a\ndaily basis with conflicting pleas for funding in many\ncontexts.\n                            2\n  Respondents also maintain that the agency-fee provision\npromotes the welfare of personal assistants and thus\ncontributes to the success of the Rehabilitation Program.\nAs a result of unionization, they claim, the wages and\nbenefits of personal assistants have been substantially\nimproved;23 orientation and training programs, back­\nground checks, and a program to deal with lost and erro­\nneous paychecks have been instituted;24 and a procedure\nwas established to resolve grievances arising under the\ncollective-bargaining agreement (but apparently not\n——————\n  23 Wages rose from $7 per hour in 2003 to $13 per hour in 2014.

The agency-fee provision cannot be sustained\nunless the cited benefits for personal assistants could not\nhave been achieved if the union had been required to\ndepend for funding on the dues paid by those personal\nassistants who chose to join. No such showing has been\nmade.\n   In claiming that the agency fee was needed to bring\nabout the cited improvements, the State is in a curious\nposition. The State is not like the closed-fisted employer\nthat is bent on minimizing employee wages and benefits\nand that yields only grudgingly under intense union pres­\nsure. As Governor Blagojevich put it in the executive\norder that first created the Illinois program, the State took\nthe initiative because it was eager for “feedback” regard­\ning the needs and views of the personal assistants. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 46. Thereafter, a majority of the\npersonal assistants voted to unionize. When they did so,\nthey must have realized that this would require the pay­\nment of union dues, and therefore it may be presumed\nthat a high percentage of these personal assistants became\nunion members and are willingly paying union dues. Why\nare these dues insufficient to enable the union to provide\n“feedback” to a State that is highly receptive to sugges­\ntions for increased wages and other improvements? A host\nof organizations advocate on behalf of the interests of\npersons falling within an occupational group, and many of\nthese groups are quite successful even though they are\ndependent on voluntary contributions.

Board of\nEd. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391\nU. S. 563 (1968). See Brief for Respondent Quinn 25–26;\nBrief for SEIU–HII 35–36; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 11. And they claim that under the Picker­\ning analysis, the Illinois scheme must be sustained. This\nargument represents an effort to find a new justification\nfor the decision in Abood, because neither in that case nor\nin any subsequent related case have we seen Abood as\nbased on Pickering balancing.26\n  In any event, this effort to recast Abood falls short. To\nbegin, the Pickering test is inapplicable because with\nrespect to the personal assistants, the State is not acting\nin a traditional employer role.27 But even if it were, appli­\n——————\n  26 The  Abood majority cited Pickering once, in a footnote, for the prop­\nosition that “there may be limits on the extent to which an employee in\na sensitive or policymaking position may freely criticize his superiors\nand the policies they espouse.” 431 U. S., at 230, n. 27. And it was\ncited once in Justice Powell’s concurrence, for the uncontroversial\nproposition that “ ‘the State has interests as an employer in regulating\nthe speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it pos­\nsesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in\ngeneral.’ ” Id., at 259 (opinion concurring in judgment) (quoting Picker­\ning, 391 U.

United States Jaycees, 468\nU. S. 609 (1984), nor Knox cited Pickering a single time.\n   27 Nor is the State acting as a “proprietor in managing its internal\n\noperations” with respect to personal assistants. See NASA v. Nelson,\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

Under those cases, employee speech is unprotected\nif it is not on a matter of public concern (or is pursuant\nto an employee’s job duties), but speech on matters of\npublic concern may be restricted only if “the interest of the\nstate, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the\npublic services it performs through its employees” out­\nweighs “the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in\ncommenting upon matters of public concern.” 391 U. S., at\n568. See also Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri, 564 U. S.\n___ (2011); Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410 (2006);\nWaters v. Churchill, 511 U. S. 661, 674 (1994) (plurality\nopinion); Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983).\n   Attempting to fit Abood into the Pickering framework,\nthe United States contends that union speech that is\ngermane to collective bargaining does not address matters\nof public concern and, as a result, is not protected. Taking\nup this argument, the dissent insists that the speech at\nissue here is not a matter of public concern. According to\nthe dissent, this is “the prosaic stuff of collective bargain­\ning.” Post, at 9. Does it have any effect on the public?\nThe dissent’s answer is: “not terribly much.” Post, at 20.\nAs the dissent sees it, speech about such funding is not\nqualitatively different from the complaints of a small-town\npolice chief regarding such matters as the denial of $338\nin overtime pay or directives concerning the use of police\nvehicles and smoking in the police station. See post, at 20;\nBorough of Duryea, supra, at ___ (slip op. at 3).28\n——————\n562 U.

We have never held that the wages paid to a public-sector bar­\ngaining unit are not a matter of public concern. The $338 payment at\nissue in Guarnieri had a negligible impact on public coffers, but pay­\n36                         HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   This argument flies in the face of reality. In this case,\nfor example, the category of union speech that is germane\nto collective bargaining unquestionably includes speech in\nfavor of increased wages and benefits for personal assis­\ntants. Increased wages and benefits for personal assis­\ntants would almost certainly mean increased expenditures\nunder the Medicaid program, and it is impossible to argue\nthat the level of Medicaid funding (or, for that matter,\nstate spending for employee benefits in general) is not a\nmatter of great public concern.\n   In recent years, Medicaid expenditures have represented\nnearly a quarter of all state expenditures. See National\nAssociation of State Budget Officers, Summary: Fall 2013\nFiscal Survey of States (Dec. 10, 2013), online at http://\nwww.nasbo.org. “Medicaid has steadily eaten up a grow­\ning share of state budgets.”29 In fiscal year 2014, “[t]hirty­\nfive states increased spending for Medicaid for a net in­\ncrease of $6.8 billion.” Ibid. Accordingly, speech by a\npowerful union that relates to the subject of Medicaid\nfunding cannot be equated with the sort of speech that our\ncases have treated as concerning matters of only private\nconcern. See, e.g., San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77 (2004)\n(per curiam); Connick, supra, at 148 (speech that “re­\nflect[ed] one employee’s dissatisfaction with a transfer and\nan attempt to turn that displeasure into a cause célèbre”\n(emphasis added)).\n   For this reason, if Pickering were to be applied, it would\n\n——————\nments made to public-sector bargaining units may have massive\nimplications for government spending. See supra, at 18, and n. 7. That\nis why the dissent’s “analogy,” post, at 20–21, is not illustrative at all.\nWe do not doubt that a single public employee’s pay is usually not a\nmatter of public concern. But when the issue is pay for an entire\ncollective-bargaining unit involving millions of dollars, that matter\naffects statewide budgeting decisions.\n   29 See Cooper, Bigger Share of State Cash for Medicaid, N.

Agency-fee provi­\nsions unquestionably impose a heavy burden on the First\nAmendment interests of objecting employees. See Knox,\n567 U. S., at ___ (slip op. at 19) (citing Lehnert, 500 U. S.,\nat 513; Jibson v. Michigan Ed. Assn., 30 F. 3d 723, 730\n(CA6 1994). And on the other side of the balance, the\narguments on which the United States relies—relating to\nthe promotion of labor peace and the problem of free rid­\ners—have already been discussed. Thus, even if the per­\nmissibility of the agency-shop provision in the collective­\nbargaining agreement now at issue were analyzed under\nPickering, that provision could not be upheld.\n                             B\n  Respondents contend, finally, that a refusal to extend\nAbood to cover the situation presented in this case will call\ninto question our decisions in Keller v. State Bar of Cal.\n496 U. S. 1 (1990), and Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.\nSystem v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217 (2000). Respondents\nare mistaken.\n  In Keller, we considered the constitutionality of a rule\napplicable to all members of an “integrated” bar, i.e., “an\nassociation of attorneys in which membership and dues\nare required as a condition of practicing law.” 496 U. S.,\nat 5. We held that members of this bar could not be re­\nquired to pay the portion of bar dues used for political or\nideological purposes but that they could be required to pay\nthe portion of the dues used for activities connected with\n38                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproposing ethical codes and disciplining bar members. Id.,\nat 14.\n  This decision fits comfortably within the framework\napplied in the present case. Licensed attorneys are sub­\nject to detailed ethics rules, and the bar rule requiring the\npayment of dues was part of this regulatory scheme. The\nportion of the rule that we upheld served the “State’s\ninterest in regulating the legal profession and improving\nthe quality of legal services.” Ibid. States also have a\nstrong interest in allocating to the members of the bar,\nrather than the general public, the expense of ensuring\nthat attorneys adhere to ethical practices. Thus, our\ndecision in this case is wholly consistent with our holding\nin Keller.\n  Contrary to respondents’ submission, the same is true\nwith respect to Southworth, supra. In that case, we up­\nheld the constitutionality of a university-imposed manda­\ntory student activities fee that was used in part to support\na wide array of student groups that engaged in expressive\nactivity. The mandatory fee was challenged by students\nwho objected to some of the expression that the fee was\nused to subsidize, but we rejected that challenge, and our\nholding is entirely consistent with our decision in this\ncase.\n  Public universities have a compelling interest in pro­\nmoting student expression in a manner that is viewpoint\nneutral. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of\nVa., 515 U. S. 819 (1995). This may be done by providing\nfunding for a broad array of student groups. If the groups\nfunded are truly diverse, many students are likely to\ndisagree with things that are said by some groups. And if\nevery student were entitled to a partial exemption from\nthe fee requirement so that no portion of the student’s fee\nwent to support a group that the student did not wish to\nsupport, the administrative problems would likely be\ninsuperable. Our decision today thus does not undermine\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

The First Amendment prohibits the\ncollection of an agency fee from personal assistants in the\nRehabilitation Program who do not want to join or support\nthe union.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part\nand affirmed in part,30 and the case is remanded for fur­\nther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\n\n——————\n   30 The Court of Appeals held—and we agree—that the First Amend­\n\nment claims of the petitioners who work, not in the Rehabilitation\nProgram, but in a different but related program, the “Disabilities\nProgram,” are not ripe. This latter program is similar in its basic\nstructure to the Rehabilitation Program, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a,\nbut the Disabilities Program personal assistants have not yet union­\nized. The Disabilities Program petitioners claim that under Illinois\nExecutive Order No. 2009–15, they face imminent unionization and,\nalong with it, compulsory dues payments. Executive Order No. 2009–\n15, they note, is “almost identical to EO 2003–08, except that it targets\nproviders in the Disabilities Program.” Brief for Petitioners 10.\n   In a 2009 mail-ballot election, the Disabilities Program personal\nassistants voted down efforts by SEIU Local 73 and American Federa­\ntion State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31 to become\ntheir representatives. See App. 27. The record before us does not\nsuggest that there are any further elections currently scheduled.

Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977), an-\nswers the question presented in this case. Abood held that\na government entity may, consistently with the First\nAmendment, require public employees to pay a fair share\nof the cost that a union incurs negotiating on their behalf\nfor better terms of employment. That is exactly what\nIllinois did in entering into collective bargaining agree-\nments with the Service Employees International Union\nHealthcare (SEIU) which included fair-share provisions.\nContrary to the Court’s decision, those agreements fall\nsquarely within Abood’s holding. Here, Illinois employs,\njointly with individuals suffering from disabilities, the in-\nhome care providers whom the SEIU represents. Illinois\nestablishes, following negotiations with the union, the\nmost important terms of their employment, including\nwages, benefits, and basic qualifications. And Illinois’s\ninterests in imposing fair-share fees apply no less to those\ncaregivers than to other state workers. The petitioners’\nchallenge should therefore fail.\n   And that result would fully comport with our decisions\napplying the First Amendment to public employment.\nAbood is not, as the majority at one point describes it,\n2                     HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n“something of an anomaly,” allowing uncommon interfer-\nence with individuals’ expressive activities. Ante, at 8.\nRather, the lines it draws and the balance it strikes reflect\nthe way courts generally evaluate claims that a condition\nof public employment violates the First Amendment. Our\ndecisions have long afforded government entities broad\nlatitude to manage their workforces, even when that\naffects speech they could not regulate in other contexts.\nAbood is of a piece with all those decisions: While protect-\ning an employee’s most significant expression, that deci-\nsion also enables the government to advance its interests\nin operating effectively—by bargaining, if it so chooses,\nwith a single employee representative and preventing free\nriding on that union’s efforts.\n   For that reason, one aspect of today’s opinion is cause\nfor satisfaction, though hardly applause. As this case\ncame to us, the principal question it presented was whether\nto overrule Abood: The petitioners devoted the lion’s\nshare of their briefing and argument to urging us to over-\nturn that nearly 40-year-old precedent (and the respond-\nents and amici countered in the same vein). Today’s\nmajority cannot resist taking potshots at Abood, see ante,\nat 17–20, but it ignores the petitioners’ invitation to de-\npart from principles of stare decisis. And the essential\nwork in the majority’s opinion comes from its extended\n(though mistaken) distinction of Abood, see ante, at 20–28,\nnot from its gratuitous dicta critiquing Abood’s founda-\ntions. That is to the good—or at least better than it might\nbe. The Abood rule is deeply entrenched, and is the foun-\ndation for not tens or hundreds, but thousands of contracts\nbetween unions and governments across the Nation. Our\nprecedent about precedent, fairly understood and applied,\nmakes it impossible for this Court to reverse that decision.\n                           I\n    I begin where this case should also end—with this\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nCourt’s decision in Abood. There, some public school\nteachers in Detroit challenged a clause in their collective\nbargaining agreement compelling non-union members to\npay the union a service charge equivalent to regular dues.\nThe Court upheld the requirement so long as the union\nwas using the money for “collective bargaining, contract\nadministration, and grievance adjustment,” rather than\nfor political or ideological activities. 431 U. S., at 225–226.\nIn so doing, the Court acknowledged that such a fair-share\nprovision “has an impact upon [public employees’] First\nAmendment interests”; employees, after all, might object\nto policies adopted or “activities undertaken by the union\nin its role as exclusive representative.” Id., at 222. Still,\nthe Court thought, the government’s own interests “consti-\ntutionally justified” the interference. Ibid. Detroit had\ndecided, the Court explained, that bargaining with a\nsingle employee representative would promote “labor\nstability” and peaceful labor relations—by ensuring, for\nexample, that different groups of employees did not pre-\nsent “conflicting demands.” Id., at 221, 229. And because\nsuch an exclusive bargaining agent has a legal duty to\nrepresent all employees, rather than just its own mem-\nbers, a compulsory surcharge fairly distributes “the cost of\n[bargaining] among those who benefit” and “counteracts\nthe incentive that employees might otherwise have to\nbecome ‘free riders.’ ” Id., at 222.\n  This case thus raises a straightforward question: Does\nAbood apply equally to Illinois’s care providers as to De-\ntroit’s teachers? No one thinks that the fair-share provi-\nsions in the two cases differ in any relevant respect. Nor\ndo the petitioners allege that the SEIU is crossing the line\nAbood drew by using their payments for political or ideo-\nlogical activities. The only point in dispute is whether it\nmatters that the personal assistants here are employees\nnot only of the State but also of the disabled persons for\nwhom they care. Just as the Court of Appeals held, that\n4                         HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nfact should make no difference to the analysis. See 656\nF. 3d 692, 698 (CA7 2011).\n   To see how easily Abood resolves this case, consider how\nIllinois structured the petitioners’ employment, and also\nwhy it did so. The petitioners work in Illinois’s Medicaid-\nfunded Rehabilitation Program, which provides in-home\nservices to persons with disabilities who otherwise would\nface institutionalization. Under the program, each disa-\nbled person (the State calls them “customers”) receives\ncare from a personal assistant; the total workforce exceeds\n20,000. The State could have asserted comprehensive\ncontrol over all the caregivers’ activities. But because of\nthe personalized nature of the services provided, Illinois\ninstead chose (as other States have as well) to share au-\nthority with the customers themselves. The result is that\neach caregiver has joint employers—the State and the\ncustomer—with each controlling significant aspects of the\nassistant’s work.1\n   For its part, Illinois sets all the workforce-wide terms of\nemployment. Most notably, the State determines and\npays the employees’ wages and benefits, including health\ninsurance (while also withholding taxes). See 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code §§686.10(h)(10), 686.40(a)–(b) (2007); App. 44–\n46. By regulation, Illinois establishes the job’s basic quali-\nfications: for example, the assistant must provide refer-\nences or recommendations and have adequate experience\nand training for the services given. See §§686.10(c), (f).\nSo too, the State describes the services any personal assis-\n——————\n    1 The\n        majority describes the petitioners as “partial” or “quasi” public\nemployees, a label of its own devising. Ante, at 28. But employment\nlaw has a real name—joint employees—for workers subject at once to\nthe authority of two or more employers (a not uncommon phenomenon).\nSee, e.g., 29 CFR §791.2 (2013); Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 376 U. S.\n473, 475 (1964). And the Department of Labor recently explained that\nin-home care programs, if structured like Illinois’s, establish joint\nemployment relationships. See 78 Fed. Reg. 60483–60484 (2013).\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

See §§686.10(h), 686.20.\n   Illinois as well structures the individual relationship\nbetween the customer and his assistant (in ways the\nmajority barely acknowledges). Along with both the cus-\ntomer and his physician, a state-employed counselor de-\nvelops a service plan laying out the assistant’s specific\njob responsibilities, hours, and working conditions. See\n§§684.10, 684.50. That counselor also assists the customer\nin conducting a state-mandated annual performance\nreview, based on state-established criteria, and mediates\nany resulting disagreements. See §686.30.\n   Within the structure designed by the State, the cus-\ntomer of course has crucial responsibilities. He exercises\nday-to-day supervisory control over the personal assistant.\nSee §676.30(b). And he gets both to hire a particular\ncaregiver (from among the pool of applicants Illinois has\ndeemed qualified) and to impose any needed discipline, up\nto and including discharge. See ibid.; §677.40(d). But\neven as to those matters, the State plays a role. Before a\ncustomer may hire an assistant, the counselor must sign\noff on the employee’s ability to follow the customer’s direc-\ntions and communicate with him. See §§686.10(d)–(e)\n(requiring that the employee demonstrate these capabili-\nties “to the satisfaction of” the counselor). And although\nonly a customer can actually fire an assistant, the State\ncan effectively do so by refusing to pay one who fails to\n“meet [state] standards.” §677.40(d). The majority reads\nthat language narrowly, see ante, at 3, n. 1, 22, but the\nState does not: It has made clear not just in its litigation\npapers, but also in its collective bargaining agreements\nand customer guidance that it will withhold payment from\nan assistant (or altogether disqualify her from the pro-\ngram) based on credible allegations of customer abuse,\nneglect, or financial exploitation.

In particular, if an assis-\ntant wants an increase in pay, she must ask the State, not\nthe individual customer. So too if she wants better bene-\nfits. (Although the majority notes that caregivers do not\nreceive statutory retirement and health insurance bene-\nfits, see ante, at 22, that is irrelevant: Collective bargain-\ning between the State and SEIU has focused on benefits\nfrom the beginning, and has produced state-funded health\ninsurance for personal assistants.) And because it is\nIllinois that would sit down at a bargaining table to ad-\ndress those subjects—the ones that matter most to em-\nployees and so most affect workforce stability—the State’s\nstake in a fair-share provision is the same as in Abood.\nHere too, the State has an interest in promoting effective\noperations by negotiating with an equitably and ade-\nquately funded exclusive bargaining agent over terms\nand conditions of employment. That Illinois has delegated\nto program customers various individualized employment\nissues makes no difference to those state interests. If\nanything, as the State has contended, the dispersion of\nemployees across numerous workplaces and the absence of\n——————\n   2 Indeed, pursuant to the grievance procedure in the present collec-\n\ntive bargaining agreement, the SEIU obtained an arbitration award\nreversing the State’s decision to disqualify an assistant from the\nprogram for such reasons. See Brief for Respondent SEIU 7 (citing Doc.\nNo. 32–5 in Case No. 10–cv–02477 (ND Ill.)).\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 46a (Exec. Order No. 2003–8).\n   Indeed, the history of that program forcefully demon-\nstrates Illinois’s interest in bargaining with an adequately\nfunded exclusive bargaining agent—that is, the interest\nAbood recognized and protected. Workforce shortages and\nhigh turnover have long plagued in-home care programs,\nprincipally because of low wages and benefits. That labor\ninstability lessens the quality of care, which in turn, forces\ndisabled persons into institutions and (massively) in-\ncreases costs to the State. See Brief for Paraprofessional\nHealthcare Institute as Amicus Curiae 16–26; Brief for\nState of California et al. as Amici Curiae 4–5. The indi-\nvidual customers are powerless to address those systemic\nissues; rather, the State—because of its control over work-\nforce-wide terms of employment—is the single employer\nthat can do so. And here Illinois determined (as have nine\nother States, see Brief for Respondent SEIU 51, n. 14) that\nnegotiations with an exclusive representative offered the\nbest chance to set the Rehabilitation Program on firmer\nfooting. Because of that bargaining, as the majority\nacknowledges, home-care assistants have nearly doubled\ntheir wages in less than 10 years, obtained state-funded\nhealth insurance, and benefited from better training and\nworkplace safety measures. See ante, at 32–33; Brief for\nRespondent Quinn 7; App. 44–48. The State, in return,\nhas obtained guarantees against strikes or other work\nstoppages, see id., at 55—and most important, believes it\nhas gotten a more stable workforce providing higher qual-\nity care, thereby avoiding the costs associated with institu-\ntionalization. Illinois’s experience thus might serve as a\n8                        HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                        KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nveritable poster child for Abood—not, as the majority\nwould have it, some strange extension of that decision.\n  It is not altogether easy to understand why the majority\nthinks what it thinks: Today’s opinion takes the tack of\nthrowing everything against the wall in the hope that\nsomething might stick. A vain hope, as it turns out. Even\nonce disentangled, the various strands of the majority’s\nreasoning do not distinguish this case from Abood.\n  Parts of the majority’s analysis appear to rest on the\nsimple presence of another employer, possessing signifi-\ncant responsibilities, in addition to the State. See ante, at\n20–22, 24. But this Court’s cases provide no warrant for\nholding that joint public employees are not real ones. To\nthe contrary, the Court has made clear that the govern-\nment’s wide latitude to manage its workforce extends to\nsuch employees, even as against their First Amendment\nclaims. The government’s prerogative as employer, we\nrecently explained, turns not on the “formal status” of an\nemployee, but on the nature of the public “interests at\nstake”; we therefore rejected the view that “the Govern-\nment’s broad authority in managing its affairs should\napply with diminished force” to contract employees whose\n“direct employment relationship” is with another party.\nNASA v. Nelson, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 14–\n15). And indeed, we reached the same result (in language\nthat might have been written for this case) when such\nemployees “d[id] not work at the government’s work-\nplace[,] d[id] not interact daily with government officers\nand employees,” and were not subject to the government’s\n“day-to-day control” over “the details of how work is done.”\nBoard of Comm’rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 518 U. S.\n668, 676–677 (1996).3 Here, as I have explained, Illinois’s\n——————\n  3 The majority claims that the Court developed this law “for use in\n\nother contexts,” ante, at 28–29, n. 20, but that is true only in the\nnarrowest sense. The decisions I cite dealt with First Amendment\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, §2405/3(f) (West 2012);\nsee ante, at 6, 22–23; but cf. Martin v. Illinois, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2267733</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *5–*8 (Ill. Workers’ Compensation Comm’n, July\n26, 2005) (treating caregivers as public employees for\npurposes of workers’ compensation).5 But once again, it is\nhard to see why that fact is relevant. The majority must\nagree (this Court has made the point often enough) that\n——————\nclaims that joint or contract employees made against the government.\nThe only difference is that those suits challenged different restrictions\non the employees’ expressive activities.\n  4 In a related argument, the majority frets that if Abood extends to\n\nthe joint employees here, a “host of workers who receive payments from\na governmental entity for some sort of service would be candidates for\ninclusion within Abood’s reach.” Ante, at 28. But as I have just shown,\nthis Court has not allowed such worries about line-drawing to limit the\ngovernment’s authority over joint and contract employees in the past.\nAnd rightly so, because whatever close cases may arise at the margin\n(there always are some), the essential distinction between such employ-\nees and mere recipients of government funding is not hard to maintain.\nConsider again the combination of things Illinois does here: set wages,\nprovide benefits, administer payroll, withhold taxes, set minimum\nqualifications, specify terms of standard contracts, develop individual-\nized service plans, fund orientation and training, facilitate annual\nreviews, and resolve certain grievances. That combination of functions\nplaces the petitioners so securely on one side of the boundary between\npublic employees and mere recipients of public funding as to justify\ndeferral of line-drawing angst to another case.\n  5 As the opinion’s quadruple repetition of the words “appear” and\n\n“apparently” suggests, ante, at 22–23, the majority is mostly guessing\nas to in-home caregivers’ eligibility for various state programs.\n10                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n“state law labels,” adopted for a whole host of reasons, do\nnot determine whether the State is acting as an employer\nfor purposes of the First Amendment. E.g., Umbehr, 518\nU. S., at 679. The true issue is whether Illinois has a\nsufficient stake in, and control over, the petitioners’ terms\nand conditions of employment to implicate Abood’s ration-\nales and trigger its application. And once more, that\nquestion has a clear answer: As I have shown, Illinois\nnegotiates all workforce-wide terms of the caregivers’\nemployment as part of its effort to promote labor stability\nand effectively administer its Rehabilitation Program. See\nsupra, at 6–8. As contrasted to that all-important fact,\nwhether Illinois incurs vicarious liability for caregivers’\ntorts, see ante, at 23, or grants them certain statutory\nbenefits like health insurance, see ante, at 22, is beside the\npoint. And still more so because the State and SEIU can\nbargain over most such matters; for example, as I have\nnoted, the two have reached agreement on providing state-\nfunded health coverage, see supra, at 7.\n  Further, the majority claims, “the scope of bargaining”\nthat the SEIU may conduct for caregivers is “circum-\nscribed” because the customer has authority over individ-\nualized employment matters like hiring and firing. Ante,\nat 23–25. But (at the risk of sounding like a broken rec-\nord) so what? Most States limit the scope of permissible\nbargaining in the public sector—often ruling out of bounds\nsimilar, individualized decisions. See R. Kearney & P.\nMareschal, Labor Relations in the Public Sector 75–77\n(5th ed. 2014) (“The great majority of state statutes” ex-\nclude “certain matters from the scope of negotiations,”\nincluding, for example, personnel decisions respecting\n“hiring, promotion, and dismissal”); Note, Developments in\nthe Law—Public Employment, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1611,\n1684 (1984) (Many state statutes “explicitly limit[ ] the\nscope of bargaining, typically by excluding decisions on\npersonnel management”). Here, the scope of collective\n                      Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     11\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nbargaining—over wages and benefits, as well as basic\nduties and qualifications—more than suffices to implicate\nthe state interests justifying Abood. Those are the mat-\nters, after all, most likely to concern employees generally\nand thus most likely to affect the nature and quality of the\nState’s workforce. The idea that Abood applies only if a\nunion can bargain with the State over every issue comes\nfrom nowhere and relates to nothing in that decision—and\nwould revolutionize public labor law.\n   Finally, the majority places weight on an idiosyncrasy of\nIllinois law: that a regulation requires uniform wages for\nall personal assistants. See ante, at 25. According to the\nmajority, that means Abood’s free-rider rationale “has\nlittle force in the situation now before us”: Even absent the\nduty of fair representation (requiring the union to work on\nbehalf of all employees, members and non-members alike,\nsee infra, at 22–23), the union could not bargain one em-\nployee’s wages against another’s. Ante, at 26.6 But that\nidea is doubly wrong. First, the Illinois regulation applies\nonly to wages. It does not cover, for example, the signifi-\ncant health benefits that the SEIU has obtained for in-\nhome caregivers, or any other benefits for which it may\nbargain in the future. Nor does the regulation prevent\npreferential participation in the grievance process, which\ngoverns all disputes between Illinois and caregivers aris-\ning from the terms of their agreement. See n. 2, supra.\nAnd second, even if the regulation covered everything\nsubject to collective bargaining, the majority’s reasoning is\na non-sequitur. All the regulation would do then is serve\nas suspenders to the duty of fair representation’s belt:\nThat Illinois has two ways to ensure that the results of\n——————\n   6 The majority also suggests in this part of its opinion that even if the\n\nunion had latitude to demand higher wages only for its own supporters,\nit would not do so. See ante, at 27, n. 18. But why not? A rational\nunion, in the absence of any legal obligation to the contrary, would\nalmost surely take that approach to bargaining.\n12                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ncollective bargaining redound to the benefit of all employ-\nees serves to compound, rather than mitigate, the union’s\nfree-rider problem.\n   As far as I can tell, that covers the majority’s reasons for\ndistinguishing this case from Abood. And even when\nconsidered in combination, as the majority does, they do\nnot succeed. What makes matters still worse is the per-\nverse result of the majority’s decision: It penalizes the\nState for giving disabled persons some control over their\nown care. If Illinois had structured the program, as it\ncould have, to centralize every aspect of the employment\nrelationship, no question could possibly have arisen about\nAbood’s application. Nothing should change because the\nState chose to respect the dignity and independence of\nprogram beneficiaries by allowing them to select and\ndischarge, as well as supervise day-to-day, their own\ncaregivers. A joint employer remains an employer, and\nhere, as I have noted, Illinois kept authority over all work-\nforce-wide terms of employment—the very issues most\nlikely to be the subject of collective bargaining. The State\nthus should also retain the prerogative—as part of its\neffort to “ensure efficient and effective delivery of personal\ncare services”—to require all employees to contribute\nfairly to their bargaining agent. App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a\n(Exec. Order No. 2003–8).\n                             II\n   Perhaps recognizing the difficulty of plausibly distin-\nguishing this case from Abood, the petitioners raised a\nmore fundamental question: the continued viability of\nAbood as to all public employees, even what the majority\ncalls “full-fledged” ones. Ante, at 9. That issue occupied\nthe brunt of the briefing and argument in this Court. See,\ne.g., Brief for Petitioners 16–24; Brief for Respondent\nSEIU 15–44; Brief for Respondent Quinn 15–29; Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 14–28; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n21, 32–39, 42–47, 50–60. The majority declines the peti-\ntioners’ request to overturn precedent—and rightly so:\nThis Court does not have anything close to the special\njustification necessary to overturn Abood. Still, the major-\nity cannot restrain itself from providing a critique of that\ndecision, suggesting that it might have resolved the case\ndifferently in the first instance. That dicta is off-base:\nAbood corresponds precisely to this Court’s overall frame-\nwork for assessing public employees’ First Amendment\nclaims. To accept that framework, while holding Abood at\narms-length, is to wish for a sui generis rule, lacking in\njustification, applying exclusively to union fees.\n                              A\n   This Court’s view of stare decisis makes plain why the\nmajority cannot—and did not—overturn Abood. That\ndoctrine, we have stated, is a “foundation stone of the rule\nof law.” Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 15). It “promotes the\nevenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of\nlegal principles [and] fosters reliance on judicial deci-\nsions.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991). As\nimportant, it “contributes to the actual and perceived\nintegrity of the judicial process,” ibid., by ensuring that\ndecisions are “founded in the law rather than in the pro-\nclivities of individuals,” Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254,\n265 (1986). For all those reasons, this Court has always\nheld that “any departure” from precedent “demands spe-\ncial justification.” Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212\n(1984).\n   And Abood is not just any precedent: It is entrenched in\na way not many decisions are. Over nearly four decades,\nwe have cited Abood favorably numerous times, and we\nhave repeatedly affirmed and applied its core distinction\nbetween the costs of collective bargaining (which the\ngovernment can demand its employees share) and those of\n14                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\npolitical activities (which it cannot). See, e.g., Locke v.\nKarass, 555 U. S. 207, 213–214 (2009); Lehnert v. Ferris\nFaculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 519 (1991); Teachers v. Hud-\nson, 475 U. S. 292, 301–302 (1986); Ellis v. Railway\nClerks, 466 U. S. 435, 455–457 (1984). Reviewing those\ndecisions, this Court recently—and unanimously—called\nthe Abood rule “a general First Amendment principle.”\nLocke, 555 U. S., 213–215. And indeed, the Court has\nrelied on that rule in deciding cases involving compulsory\nfees outside the labor context—which today’s majority\nreaffirms as good law, see ante, at 37–39. See, e.g., Keller\nv. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 9–17 (1990) (state bar\nfees); Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. South-\nworth, 529 U. S. 217, 230–232 (2000) (public university\nstudent fees); Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott,\nInc., 521 U. S. 457, 471–473 (1997) (commercial advertis-\ning assessments). Not until two years ago, in Knox v.\nService Employees, 567 U. S. ___ (2012), did the Court so\nmuch as whisper (there without the benefit of briefing or\nargument, see id., at ___ (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in\njudgment) (slip op., at 1–6)) that it had any misgivings\nabout Abood.\n  Perhaps still more important, Abood has created enor-\nmous reliance interests. More than 20 States have enacted\nstatutes authorizing fair-share provisions, and on that\nbasis public entities of all stripes have entered into multi-\nyear contracts with unions containing such clauses. “Stare\ndecisis has added force,” we have held, when overturning a\nprecedent would require “States to reexamine [and amend]\ntheir statutes.” Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways\nComm’n, 502 U. S. 197, 202–203 (1991). And on top of\nthat, “[c]onsiderations in favor of stare decisis are at their\nacme in cases involving property and contract rights.”\nPayne, 501 U. S., at 828. Here, governments and unions\nacross the country have entered into thousands of con-\ntracts involving millions of employees in reliance on\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nAbood. Reliance interests do not come any stronger.\n   The majority’s criticisms of Abood do not remotely de-\nfeat those powerful reasons for adhering to the decision.\nThe special justifications needed to reverse an opinion\nmust go beyond demonstrations (much less assertions)\nthat it was wrong; that is the very point of stare decisis.\nAnd the majority’s critique extends no further. It is mostly\njust a catalog of errors Abood supposedly committed—\nreproaches that could have been leveled as easily 40 years\nago as today. Only the idea that Abood did not “antici-\npate” or “foresee” the difficulties of distinguishing between\ncollective bargaining and political activities, see ante, at\n18–19, might be thought different. But in fact, Abood\npredicted precisely those issues. See 431 U. S., at 236\n(“There will, of course, be difficult problems in drawing\nlines between collective-bargaining . . . and ideological\nactivities”). It simply disagreed with today’s majority\nabout whether in this context, as in many others, lines\nthat are less than pristine are still worth using. And in\nany event, the majority much overstates the difficulties of\nclassifying union expenditures. The Court’s most recent\ndecision on the subject unanimously resolved the single\nissue that had divided lower courts. See Locke, 555 U. S.,\nat 217–221. So it is not surprising that the majority fails\nto offer any concrete examples of thorny classification\nproblems. If the kind of hand-wringing about blurry lines\nthat the majority offers were enough to justify breaking\nwith precedent, we might have to discard whole volumes\nof the U. S. Reports.\n   And the majority says nothing to the contrary: It does\nnot pretend to have the requisite justifications to overrule\nAbood. Readers of today’s decision will know that Abood\ndoes not rank on the majority’s top-ten list of favorite\nprecedents—and that the majority could not restrain itself\nfrom saying (and saying and saying) so. Yet they will also\nknow that the majority could not, even after receiving full-\n16                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ndress briefing and argument, come up with reasons any-\nwhere near sufficient to reverse the decision. Much has\ngone wrong in today’s ruling, but this has not: Save for an\nunfortunate hiving off of ostensibly “partial-public” em-\nployees, ante, at 28, Abood remains the law.\n                              B\n    And even apart from stare decisis, that result is as it\nshould be; indeed, it is the only outcome that makes sense\nin the context of our caselaw. In numerous cases decided\nover many decades, this Court has addressed the govern-\nment’s authority to adopt measures limiting expression in\nthe capacity not of sovereign but of employer. Abood fits—\nfits hand-in-glove—with all those cases, in both reasoning\nand result. Were that rule not in place, our law respecting\npublic employees’ speech rights would contain a serious\nanomaly—a different legal standard (and not a good one)\napplying exclusively to union fees.\n    This Court has long acknowledged that the government\nhas wider constitutional latitude when it is acting as\nemployer than as sovereign. See Engquist v. Oregon Dept.\nof Agriculture, 553 U. S. 591, 598 (2008) (“[T]here is a\ncrucial difference, with respect to constitutional analysis,\nbetween the government exercising the power to regulate\n. . . and the government acting . . . to manage [its] internal\noperation” (internal quotation marks omitted)). “Time and\nagain our cases have recognized that the Government has\na much freer hand” in dealing with its employees than\nwith other citizens. NASA, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n12). We have explained that “[t]he government’s interest\nin achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as pos-\nsible is elevated” in the public workplace—that the gov-\nernment must have the ability to decide how to manage its\nemployees in order to best provide services to the public.\nEngquist, 553 U. S., at 598. In effect, we have tried to\nplace the government-qua-employer in a similar (though\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nnot identical) position to the private employer, recognizing\nthat both face comparable challenges in maintaining a\nproductive workforce. The result is that a public employee\n“must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom.”\nGarcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 418 (2006).\n“[A]lthough government employees do not lose their con-\nstitutional rights when they accept their positions, those\nrights must be balanced against the realities of the em-\nployment context.” Engquist, 553 U. S., at 600.\n   Further, this Court has developed and applied those\nprinciples in numerous cases involving First Amendment\nclaims. “Government employers, like private employers,”\nwe have explained, “need a significant degree of control\nover their employees’ words” in order to “efficient[ly]\nprovi[de] public services.” Garcetti, 547 U. S., at 418.\nAccordingly, we have devised methods for distinguishing\nbetween speech restrictions reflecting the kind of concerns\nprivate employers often hold (which are constitutional)\nand those exploiting the employment relationship to re-\nstrict employees’ speech as private citizens (which are\nnot). Most notably, the Court uses a two-step test origi-\nnating in Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High\nSchool Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563 (1968). First, if\nthe expression at issue does not relate to “a matter of\npublic concern,” the employee “has no First Amendment\ncause of action.” Garcetti, 547 U. S., at 418. Second, even\nif the speech addresses a matter of public concern, a court\nis to determine whether the government “had an adequate\njustification” for its action, ibid., by balancing “the inter-\nests of the [employee] as a citizen . . . and the interest of\nthe State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of\nthe public services it performs through its employees,”\nPickering, 391 U. S., at 568.\n   Abood is of a piece with all those decisions; and indeed,\nits core analysis mirrors Pickering’s. The Abood Court\nrecognized that fair-share provisions function as prerequi-\n18                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nsites to employment, assessed to cover the costs of repre-\nsenting employees in collective bargaining. Private em-\nployers, Abood noted, often established such employment\nconditions, to ensure adequate funding of an exclusive\nbargaining agent, and thus to promote labor stability.\nAbood acknowledged (contrary to the majority’s statement,\nsee ante, at 17) certain “differences in the nature of collec-\ntive bargaining in the public and private sectors.” 431\nU. S., at 227; see id., at 227–229. But the Court concluded\nthat the government, acting as employer, should have the\nsame prerogative as a private business in deciding how\nbest to negotiate with its employees over such matters as\nwages and benefits. See id., at 229 (“[T]here can be no\nprincipled basis for” distinguishing between a public and\nprivate employer’s view that a fair-share clause will pro-\nmote “labor stability”). At the same time, the Court rec-\nognized the need for some mechanism to ensure that the\ngovernment could not leverage its power as employer to\nimpinge on speech its employees undertook as citizens on\nmatters of public import. See id., at 234–236.\n   The Court struck the appropriate balance by drawing a\nline, corresponding to Pickering’s, between fees for collec-\ntive bargaining and those for political activities. On the\none side, Abood decided, speech within the employment\nrelationship about pay and working conditions pertains\nmostly to private concerns and implicates the govern-\nment’s interests as employer; thus, the government could\ncompel fair-share fees for collective bargaining. On the\nother side, speech in political campaigns relates to matters\nof public concern and has no bearing on the government’s\ninterest in structuring its workforce; thus, compelled fees\nfor those activities are forbidden. In that way, the law\nsurrounding fair-share provisions coheres with the law\nrelating to public employees’ speech generally. Or, said\notherwise, an anomaly in the government’s regulation of\nits workforce would arise in Abood’s absence: Public em-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nployers could then pursue all policies, except this single\none, reasonably designed to manage personnel and en-\nhance the effectiveness of their programs.\n   The majority’s critique of Abood principally goes astray\nby deeming all this irrelevant. This Court, the majority\ninsists, has never “seen Abood as based on Pickering\nbalancing.” Ante, at 34. But to rely on Abood’s failure to\ncite Pickering more often, as the majority does, see ante, at\n34, n. 26, is to miss the essential point. Although stem-\nming from different historic antecedents, the two decisions\naddressed variants of the same issue: the extent of the\ngovernment’s power to adopt employment conditions\naffecting expression. And as just discussed, the two\ngave strikingly parallel answers, providing a coherent\nframework to adjudicate the constitutionality of those\nregulations.\n   To the extent the majority engages with that frame-\nwork, its analysis founders at the first step, in assessing\nthe First Amendment value of the speech at issue here. A\nrunning motif of the majority opinion is that collective\nbargaining in the public sector raises significant questions\nabout the level of government spending. Ante, at 17–18\nand n. 7, 36 and nn. 28–29. By financing the SEIU’s\ncollective bargaining over wages and benefits, the majority\nsuggests, in-home caregivers—whether they wish to or\nnot—take one side in a debate about those issues.\n   But that view of the First Amendment interests at stake\nblinks decades’ worth of this Court’s precedent. Our deci-\nsions (tracing from Pickering as well as Abood) teach that\ninternal workplace speech about public employees’ wages,\nbenefits, and such—that is, the prosaic stuff of collective\nbargaining—does not become speech of “public concern”\njust because those employment terms may have broader\nconsequence. To the contrary, we have made clear that\nexcept in narrow circumstances we will not allow an em-\nployee to make a “federal constitutional issue” out of basic\n20                   HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n“employment matters, including working conditions, pay,\ndiscipline, promotions, leave, vacations, and termina-\ntions.” Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 10); see Umbehr, 518 U. S., at 675\n(public employees’ “speech on merely private employment\nmatters is unprotected”). Indeed, even Abood’s original\ndetractors conceded that an employee’s interest in ex-\npressing views, within the workplace context, about “nar-\nrowly defined economic issues [like] salaries and pension\nbenefits” is “relatively insignificant” and “weak.” 431\nU. S., at 263, n. 16 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).\n(Those Justices saved their fire for teachers’ speech relat-\ning to education policy. See ibid.) And nowhere has the\nCourt ever suggested, as the majority does today, see ante,\nat 35–36 and n. 28, that if a certain dollar amount is at\nstake (but how much, exactly?), the constitutional treat-\nment of an employee’s expression becomes any different.\n   Consider an analogy, not involving union fees: Suppose\nan employee violates a government employer’s work rules\nby demanding, at various inopportune times and places,\nhigher wages for both himself and his co-workers (which,\nof course, will drive up public spending). The government\nemployer disciplines the employee, and he brings a First\nAmendment claim. Would the Court consider his speech a\nmatter of public concern under Pickering? I cannot believe\nit would, and indeed the petitioners’ own counsel joins me\nin that view. He maintained at oral argument that such\nspeech would concern merely an “internal proprietary\nmatter,” thus allowing the employer to take disciplinary\naction. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 10. If the majority thinks oth-\nerwise, government entities across the country should\nprepare themselves for unprecedented limitations on their\nability to regulate their workforces. But again, I doubt\nthey need to worry, because this Court has never come\nclose to holding that any matter of public employment\naffecting public spending (which is to say most such mat-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           21\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nters) becomes for that reason alone an issue of public\nconcern. (And on the off-chance that both the petitioners\nand I are wrong on that score, I am doubly confident that\nthe government would prevail under Pickering’s balancing\ntest.)\n   I can see no reason to treat the expressive interests of\nworkers objecting to payment of union fees, like the peti-\ntioners here, as worthy of greater consideration. The\nsubject matter of the speech is the same: wages and bene-\nfits for public employees. Or to put the point more fully:\nIn both cases (mine and the real one), the employer is\nsanctioning employees for choosing either to say or not to\nsay something respecting their terms and conditions of\nemployment. Of course, in my hypothetical, the employer\nis stopping the employee from speaking, whereas in this or\nany other case involving union fees, the employer is forc-\ning the employee to support such expression. But I am\nsure the majority would agree that that difference does\nnot make a difference—in other words, that the “difference\nbetween compelled speech and compelled silence” is “with-\nout constitutional significance.” Riley v. National Federa-\ntion of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 796 (1988).\nHence, in analyzing the kind of expression involved in this\ncase, Abood corresponds to Pickering (and vice versa)—\nwith each permitting a government to regulate such activ-\nity in aid of managing its workforce to provide public\nservices.\n   Perhaps, though, the majority’s skepticism about Abood\ncomes from a different source: its failure to fully grasp the\ngovernment’s interest in bargaining with an adequately\nfunded exclusive bargaining representative. One of the ma-\njority’s criticisms of Abood, stated still more prominently\nin Knox, 567 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10–11), goes some-\nthing as follows. Abood (so the majority says) wrongly saw\na government’s interest in bargaining with an exclusive\nrepresentative as “inextricably linked” with a fair-share\n22                   HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nagreement. Ante, at 31; see ante, at 20. A State, the\nmajority (a bit grudgingly) acknowledges, may well have\nreasons to bargain with a single agent for all employees;\nand without a fair-share agreement, that union’s activities\nwill benefit employees who do not pay dues. Yet “[s]uch\nfree-rider arguments,” the majority avers, “are generally\ninsufficient to overcome First Amendment objections.”\nAnte, at 8–9 (quoting Knox, 567 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n10–11)). In the majority’s words: “A host of organizations\nadvocate on behalf of the interests of persons falling\nwithin an occupational group, and many of these groups\nare quite successful even though they are dependent on\nvoluntary contributions.” Ante, at 33–34.\n   But Abood and a host of our other opinions have ex-\nplained and relied on an essential distinction between\nunions and special-interest organizations generally. See,\ne.g., Abood, 431 U. S., at 221–222 and n. 15; Communica-\ntions Workers v. Beck, 487 U. S. 735, 750 (1988); Machin-\nists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 762 (1961). The law compels\nunions to represent—and represent fairly—every worker\nin a bargaining unit, regardless whether they join or\ncontribute to the union. That creates a collective action\nproblem of far greater magnitude than in the typical\ninterest group, because the union cannot give any special\nadvantages to its own backers. In such a circumstance,\nnot just those who oppose but those who favor a union\nhave an economic incentive to withhold dues; only altru-\nism or loyalty—as against financial self-interest—can\nexplain their support. Hence arises the legal rule counte-\nnancing fair-share agreements: It ensures that a union\nwill receive adequate funding, notwithstanding its legally\nimposed disability—and so that a government wishing to\nbargain with an exclusive representative will have a via-\nble counterpart.\n   As is often the case, JUSTICE SCALIA put the point best:\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           23\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n    “Where the state imposes upon the union a duty to de-\n    liver services, it may permit the union to demand re-\n    imbursement for them; or, looked at from the other\n    end, where the state creates in the nonmembers a le-\n    gal entitlement from the union, it may compel them to\n    pay the cost. The ‘compelling state interest’ that justi-\n    fies this constitutional rule is not simply elimination\n    of the inequity arising from the fact that some union\n    activity redounds to the benefit of ‘free-riding’ non-\n    members; private speech often furthers the interests\n    of nonspeakers, and that does not alone empower the\n    state to compel the speech to be paid for. What is dis-\n    tinctive, however, about the ‘free riders’ [in unions]\n    . . . is that . . . the law requires the union to carry\n    [them]—indeed, requires the union to go out of its way\n    to benefit [them], even at the expense of its other in-\n    terests. . . . [T]he free ridership (if it were left to be\n    that) would be not incidental but calculated, not im-\n    posed by circumstances but mandated by government\n    decree.” Lehnert, 500 U. S., at 556 (opinion concur-\n    ring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\nAnd in other parts of its opinion, the majority itself mim-\nics the point, thus recognizing the core rationale of Abood:\nWhat justifies the agency fee, the majority notes, is “the\nfact that the State compels the union to promote and\nprotect the interests of nonmembers.” Ante, at 25; see\nante, at 27, n. 18. Exactly right; indeed, that is as clear a\none-sentence account of Abood’s free-rider rationale as\nappears in this Court’s decisions.\n   Still, the majority too quickly says, it has no worries in\nthis case: Given that Illinois’s caregivers voted to unionize,\n“it may be presumed that a high percentage of [them]\nbecame union members and are willingly paying union\ndues.” Ante, at 33. But in fact nothing of the sort may be\nso presumed, given that union supporters (no less than\n24                       HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nunion detractors) have an economic incentive to free ride.\nSee supra, at 22–23. The federal workforce, on which the\nmajority relies, see ante, at 31, provides a case in point.\nThere many fewer employees pay dues than have voted for\na union to represent them.7 And why, after all, should\nthat endemic free-riding be surprising? Does the majority\nthink that public employees are immune from basic prin-\nciples of economics? If not, the majority can have no basis\nfor thinking that absent a fair-share clause, a union can\nattract sufficient dues to adequately support its functions.\n  This case in fact offers a prime illustration of how a fair-\nshare agreement may serve important government inter-\nests. Recall that Illinois decided that collective bargaining\nwith an exclusive representative of in-home caregivers\nwould enable it to provide improved services through its\nRehabilitation Program. See supra, at 7–8. The State\nthought such bargaining would enable it to attract a better\nand more stable workforce to serve disabled patients,\npreventing their institutionalization and thereby decreas-\ning total state expenditures. The majority does not deny\nthe State’s legitimate interest in choosing to negotiate\nwith an exclusive bargaining agent, in service of adminis-\ntering an effective program. See ante, at 32–33. But the\nmajority does deny Illinois the means it reasonably\ndeemed appropriate to effectuate that policy—a fair-share\nprovision ensuring that the union has the funds necessary\nto carry out its responsibilities on behalf of in-home care-\n\n——————\n  7 See, e.g., R. Kearney & P. Mareschal, Labor Relations in the Public\n\nSector 26 (5th ed. 2014) (“[T]he largest federal union, the American\nFederation of Government Employees (AFGE), represented approxi-\nmately 650,000 bargaining unit members in 2012, but less than half of\nthem were dues-paying members.

The majority does so against the weight of all\nprecedent, and based on “empirical assumption[s],” ante,\nat 20, lacking any foundation. Abood got this matter\nright; the majority gets it wrong: Illinois has a more than\nsufficient interest, in managing its workforce and admin-\nistering the Rehabilitation Program, to require employees\nto pay a fair share of a union’s costs of collective bargaining.\n                             III\n   For many decades, Americans have debated the pros\nand cons of right-to-work laws and fair-share require-\nments. All across the country and continuing to the pre-\nsent day, citizens have engaged in passionate argument\nabout the issue and have made disparate policy choices.\nThe petitioners in this case asked this Court to end that\ndiscussion for the entire public sector, by overruling Abood\nand thus imposing a right-to-work regime for all govern-\nment employees. The good news out of this case is clear:\nThe majority declined that radical request. The Court did\nnot, as the petitioners wanted, deprive every state and\nlocal government, in the management of their employees\nand programs, of the tool that many have thought neces-\nsary and appropriate to make collective bargaining work.\n   The bad news is just as simple: The majority robbed\nIllinois of that choice in administering its in-home care\nprogram. For some 40 years, Abood has struck a stable\nbalance—consistent with this Court’s general framework\nfor assessing public employees’ First Amendment claims—\nbetween those employees’ rights and government entities’\ninterests in managing their workforces. The majority\ntoday misapplies Abood, which properly should control\nthis case. Nothing separates, for purposes of that decision,\nIllinois’s personal assistants from any other public em-\nployees. The balance Abood struck thus should have\ndefeated the petitioners’ demand to invalidate Illinois’s\nfair-share agreement.

Argued January 21, 2014—Decided June 30, 2014\nIllinois’ Home Services Program (Rehabilitation Program) allows Medi-\n   caid recipients who would normally need institutional care to hire a\n   “personal assistant” (PA) to provide homecare services. Under State\n   law, the homecare recipients (designated “customers”) and the State\n   both play some role in the employment relationship with the PAs.\n   Customers control most aspects of the employment relationship, in-\n   cluding the hiring, firing, training, supervising, and disciplining of\n   PAs; they also define the PA’s duties by proposing a “Service Plan.”\n   Other than compensating PAs, the State’s involvement in employ-\n   ment matters is minimal. Its employer status was created by execu-\n   tive order, and later codified by the legislature, solely to permit PAs\n   to join a labor union and engage in collective bargaining under Illi-\n   nois’ Public Labor Relations Act (PLRA).\n      Pursuant to this scheme, respondent SEIU Healthcare Illinois &\n   Indiana (SEIU–HII) was designated the exclusive union representa-\n   tive for Rehabilitation Program employees. The union entered into\n   collective-bargaining agreements with the State that contained an\n   agency-fee provision, which requires all bargaining unit members\n   who do not wish to join the union to pay the union a fee for the cost of\n   certain activities, including those tied to the collective-bargaining\n   process. A group of Rehabilitation Program PAs brought a class ac-\n   tion against SEIU–HII and other respondents in Federal District\n   Court, claiming that the PLRA violated the First Amendment insofar\n   as it authorized the agency-fee provision. The District Court dis-\n   missed their claims, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed in relevant\n   part, concluding that the PAs were state employees within the mean-\n   ing of Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209.\n2                         HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: The First Amendment prohibits the collection of an agency fee\n from Rehabilitation Program PAs who do not want to join or support\n the union. Pp. 8–40.\n    (a) In upholding the Illinois law’s constitutionality, the Seventh\n Circuit relied on Abood, which, in turn, relied on Railway Employes\n v. Hanson, 351 U. S. 225, and Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740.\n Unlike Abood, those cases involved private-sector collective-\n bargaining agreements. The Abood Court treated the First Amend-\n ment issue as largely settled by Hanson and Street and understood\n those cases to have upheld agency fees based on the desirability of\n “labor peace” and the problem of “ ‘free riders[hip].’ ” 431 U. S., 220–\n 222, 224. However, “preventing nonmembers from free-riding on the\n union’s efforts” is a rationale “generally insufficient to overcome First\n Amendment objections,” Knox v. Service Employees, 567 U. S. ___,\n ___, and in this respect, Abood is “something of an anomaly,” 567\n U. S., at ___.\n    The Abood Court’s analysis is questionable on several grounds.\n The First Amendment analysis in Hanson was thin, and Street was\n not a constitutional decision. And the Court fundamentally misun-\n derstood Hanson’s narrow holding, which upheld the authorization,\n not imposition, of an agency fee. The Abood Court also failed to ap-\n preciate the distinction between core union speech in the public sec-\n tor and core union speech in the private sector, as well as the concep-\n tual difficulty in public-sector cases of distinguishing union\n expenditures for collective bargaining from those designed for politi-\n cal purposes. Nor does the Abood Court seem to have anticipated the\n administrative problems that would result in attempting to classify\n union expenditures as either chargeable or nonchargeable, see, e.g.,\n Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, or the practical prob-\n lems that would arise from the heavy burden facing objecting non-\n members wishing to challenge the union’s actions. Finally, the Abood\n Court’s critical “labor peace” analysis rests on the unsupported em-\n pirical assumption that exclusive representation in the public sector\n depends on the right to collect an agency fee from nonmembers.\n Pp. 8–20.\n    (b) Because of Abood’s questionable foundations, and because Illi-\n nois’ PAs are quite different from full-fledged public employees, this\n Court refuses to extend Abood to the situation here. Pp. 20–29.\n      (1) PAs are much different from public employees. Unlike full-\n fledged public employees, PAs are almost entirely answerable to the\n customers and not to the State, do not enjoy most of the rights and\n benefits that inure to state employees, and are not indemnified by the\n State for claims against them arising from actions taken during the\n course of their employment. Even the scope of collective bargaining\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\non their behalf is sharply limited. Pp. 20–25.\n      (2) Abood’s rationale is based on the assumption that the union\npossesses the full scope of powers and duties generally available un-\nder American labor law. Even the best argument for Abood’s anoma-\nlous approach is a poor fit here. What justifies the agency fee in the\nAbood context is the fact that the State compels the union to promote\nand protect the interests of nonmembers in “negotiating and admin-\nistering a collective-bargaining agreement and representing the in-\nterests of employees in settling disputes and processing grievances.”\nLehnert, supra, at 556. That rationale has little application here,\nwhere Illinois law requires that all PAs receive the same rate of pay\nand the union has no authority with respect to a PA’s grievances\nagainst a customer. Pp. 25–27.\n      (3) Extending Abood’s boundaries to encompass partial public\nemployees would invite problems. State regulations and benefits af-\nfecting such employees exist along a continuum, and it is unclear at\nwhat point, short of full-fledged public employment, Abood should\napply. Under respondents’ view, a host of workers who currently re-\nceive payments from a government entity for some sort of service\nwould become candidates for inclusion within Abood’s reach, and it\nwould be hard to see where to draw the line. Pp. 27–29.\n   (c) Because Abood does not control here, generally applicable First\nAmendment standards apply. Thus, the agency-fee provision here\nmust serve a “ ‘compelling state interes[t] . . . that cannot be achieved\nthrough means significantly less restrictive of associational free-\ndoms.’ ” Knox, supra, at ___. None of the interests that respondents\ncontend are furthered by the agency-fee provision is sufficient.\nPp. 29–34.\n      (1) Their claim that the agency-fee provision promotes “labor\npeace” misses the point. Petitioners do not contend that they have a\nFirst Amendment right to form a rival union or that SEIU–HII has\nno authority to serve as the exclusive bargaining representative.\nThis, along with examples from some federal agencies and many\nstate laws, demonstrates that a union’s status as exclusive bargain-\ning agent and the right to collect an agency fee from nonmembers are\nnot inextricably linked. Features of the Illinois scheme—e.g., PAs do\nnot work together in a common state facility and the union’s role is\nvery restricted—further undermine the “labor peace” argument.\nPp. 31–32.\n      (2) Respondents also argue that the agency-fee provision pro-\nmotes the welfare of PAs, thereby contributing to the Rehabilitation\nProgram’s success. Even assuming that SEIU–HII has been an effec-\ntive advocate, the agency-fee provision cannot be sustained unless\nthe union could not adequately advocate without the receipt of non-\n4                           HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    member agency fees. No such showing has been made. Pp. 32–34.\n       (d) Respondents’ additional arguments for sustaining the Illinois\n    scheme are unconvincing. First, they urge the application of a bal-\n    ancing test derived from Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High\n    School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563. This Court has never\n    viewed Abood and its progeny as based on Pickering balancing. And\n    even assuming that Pickering applies, that case’s balancing test\n    clearly tips in favor of the objecting employees’ First Amendment in-\n    terests. Second, respondents err in contending that a refusal to ex-\n    tend Abood here will call into question this Court’s decisions in Keller\n    v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, and Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.\n    System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, for those decisions fit comforta-\n    bly within the framework applied here.

PAT QUINN,\n        GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 30, 2014] \n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case presents the question whether the First\nAmendment permits a State to compel personal care\nproviders to subsidize speech on matters of public concern\nby a union that they do not wish to join or support. We\nhold that it does not, and we therefore reverse the judg­\nment of the Court of Appeals.\n                             I\n                             A\n  Millions of Americans, due to age, illness, or injury, are\nunable to live in their own homes without assistance and\nare unable to afford the expense of in-home care. In order\nto prevent these individuals from having to enter a nurs­\ning home or other facility, the federal Medicaid program\nfunds state-run programs that provide in-home services to\nindividuals whose conditions would otherwise require\ninstitutionalization. See 42 U. S. C. §1396n(c)(1). A State\nthat adopts such a program receives federal funds to\ncompensate persons who attend to the daily needs of\nindividuals needing in-home care. Ibid.; see also 42 CFR\n§§440.180, 441.300–441.310 (2013). Almost every State\nhas established such a program. See Dept. of Health and\n2                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHuman Services, Understanding Medicaid Home and\nCommunity Services: A Primer (2010).\n   One of those States is Illinois, which has created the\nIllinois Department of Human Services Home Services\nProgram, known colloquially as the state “Rehabilitation\nProgram.” Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, §2405/3(f ) (West 2012);\n89 Ill. Admin. Code §676.10 (2007). “[D]esigned to prevent\nthe unnecessary institutionalization of individuals who\nmay instead be satisfactorily maintained at home at a\nlesser cost to the State,” §676.10(a), the Rehabilitation\nProgram allows participants to hire a “personal assistant”\nwho provides homecare services tailored to the individual’s\nneeds. Many of these personal assistants are relatives of\nthe person receiving care, and some of them provide care\nin their own homes. See App. 16–18.\n   Illinois law establishes an employer-employee relation­\nship between the person receiving the care and the person\nproviding it. The law states explicitly that the person\nreceiving home care—the “customer”—“shall be the em­\nployer of the [personal assistant].” 89 Ill. Admin. Code\n§676.30(b) (emphasis added). A “personal assistant” is\ndefined as “an individual employed by the customer to\nprovide . . . varied services that have been approved by the\ncustomer’s physician,” §676.30(p) (emphasis added), and\nthe law makes clear that Illinois “shall not have control or\ninput in the employment relationship between the cus­\ntomer and the personal assistants.” §676.10(c).\n   Other provisions of the law emphasize the customer’s\nemployer status. The customer “is responsible for control­\nling all aspects of the employment relationship between\nthe customer and the [personal assistant (or PA)], includ­\ning, without limitation, locating and hiring the PA, train­\ning the PA, directing, evaluating and otherwise supervis­\ning the work performed by the personal assistant,\nimposing . . . disciplinary action against the PA, and ter­\nminating the employment relationship between the cus­\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntomer and the PA.” §676.30(b).1 In general, the customer\n“has complete discretion in which Personal Assistant\nhe/she wishes to hire.” §684.20(b).\n   A customer also controls the contents of the document,\nthe Service Plan, that lists the services that the customer\nwill receive. §684.10(a). No Service Plan may take effect\nwithout the approval of both the customer and the cus­\ntomer’s physician. See §684.10, 684.40, 684.50, 684.75.\nService Plans are highly individualized. The Illinois State\nLabor Relations Board noted in 1985 that “[t]here is no\ntypical employment arrangement here, public or other­\nwise; rather, there simply exists an arrangement whereby\nthe state of Illinois pays individuals . . . to work under the\ndirection and control of private third parties.” Illinois\nDept. of Central Management Serv., No. S–RC–115, 2\nPERI ¶2007, p. VIII–30, (1985), superseded, 2003 Ill.\nLaws p. 1929.\n   While customers exercise predominant control over their\nemployment relationship with personal assistants, the\nState, subsidized by the federal Medicaid program, pays\nthe personal assistants’ salaries. The amount paid varies\ndepending on the services provided, but as a general mat­\nter, it “corresponds to the amount the State would expect\nto pay for the nursing care component of institutionaliza­\ntion if the individual chose institutionalization.” 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code §679.50(a).\n——————\n  1 Although  this regulation states clearly that a customer has complete\ndiscretion with respect to hiring and firing a personal assistant, the\ndissent contends that the State also has the authority to end the\nemployment of a personal assistant whose performance is not satisfac­\ntory. Nothing in the regulations supports this view. Under 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code §677.40(d), the State may stop paying a personal assistant\nif it is found that the assistant does not meet “the standards estab­\nlished by DHS as found at 89 Ill. Adm. Code 686.” These standards are\nthe basic hiring requirements set out in §686.10, see n. 2, infra. Provid­\ning adequate performance after hiring is nowhere mentioned in\n§686.10.\n4                          HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Other than providing compensation, the State’s role is\ncomparatively small. The State sets some basic threshold\nqualifications for employment. See §§686.10(h)(1)–(10).2\n(For example, a personal assistant must have a Social\nSecurity number, must possess basic communication\nskills, and must complete an employment agreement with\nthe customer. §§686.10, 686.20, 686.40.) The State man­\ndates an annual performance review by the customer,\nhelps the customer conduct that review, and mediates\ndisagreements between customers and their personal\nassistants. §686.30. The State suggests certain duties\nthat personal assistants should assume, such as perform­\ning “household tasks,” “shopping,” providing “personal\ncare,” performing “incidental health care tasks,” and\n“monitoring to ensure the health and safety of the cus­\ntomer.” §686.20. In addition, a state employee must “identify\nthe appropriate level of service provider” “based on the\ncustomer’s approval of the initial Service Plan,” §684.20(a)\n(emphasis added), and must sign each customer’s Service\nPlan. §684.10.\n                              B\n  Section 6 of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act\n(PLRA) authorizes state employees to join labor unions\nand to bargain collectively on the terms and conditions of\n——————\n  2 It is true, as the dissent notes, post, at 4, that a personal assistant\n\nmust provide two written or oral references, see §686.10(c), but judging\nthe adequacy of these references is the sole prerogative of the customer.\nSee §676.30(b). And while the regulations say that an applicant must\nhave either previous experience or training, see §686.10(f ), they also\nprovide that a customer has complete discretion to judge the adequacy\nof training and prior experience. See §684.20(b) (the customer has\ncomplete discretion with respect to hiring and training a personal\nassistant). See also §686.10(b) (the customer may hire a minor—even\nunder some circumstances, a person as young as 14); §686.10(f ) (the\ncustomer may hire a personal assistant who was never previously\nemployed so long as the assistant has adequate training); §684.20(b)\n(criminal record check not required).\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nemployment. Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 5, §315/6(a). This law\napplies to “[e]mployees of the State and any political sub­\ndivision of the State,” subject to certain exceptions, and it\nprovides for a union to be recognized if it is “designated by\nthe [Public Labor Relations] Board as the representative\nof the majority of public employees in an appropriate unit\n. . . .” §§315/6(a), (c).\n    The PLRA contains an agency-fee provision, i.e., a provi­\nsion under which members of a bargaining unit who do not\nwish to join the union are nevertheless required to pay a\nfee to the union. See Workers v. Mobil Oil Corp., 426 U. S.\n407, 409, n. 1 (1976). Labeled a “fair share” provision, this\nsection of the PLRA provides: “When a collective bargain­\ning agreement is entered into with an exclusive repre­\nsentative, it may include in the agreement a provision\nrequiring employees covered by the agreement who are\nnot members of the organization to pay their proportionate\nshare of the costs of the collective-bargaining process,\ncontract administration and pursuing matters affecting\nwages, hours and conditions of employment.” §315/6(e).\nThis payment is “deducted by the employer from the earn­\nings of the nonmember employees and paid to the em-\nployee organization.” Ibid.\n    In the 1980’s, the Service Employees International\nUnion (SEIU) petitioned the Illinois Labor Relations\nBoard for permission to represent personal assistants\nemployed by customers in the Rehabilitation Program, but\nthe board rebuffed this effort. Illinois Dept. of Central\nManagement Servs., supra, at VIII–30. The board con­\ncluded that “it is clear . . . that [Illinois] does not exercise\nthe type of control over the petitioned-for employees nec­\nessary to be considered, in the collective bargaining con­\ntext envisioned by the [PLRA], their ‘employer’ or, at least,\ntheir sole employer.” Ibid.\n    In March 2003, however, Illinois’ newly elected Gover­\nnor, Rod Blagojevich, circumvented this decision by issu­\n6                     HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning Executive Order 2003–08. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n45a–47a. The order noted the Illinois Labor Relations\nBoard decision but nevertheless called for state recogni­\ntion of a union as the personal assistants’ exclusive repre­\nsentative for the purpose of collective bargaining with the\nState. This was necessary, Gov. Blagojevich declared, so\nthat the State could “receive feedback from the personal\nassistants in order to effectively and efficiently deliver\nhome services.” Id., at 46a. Without such representation,\nthe Governor proclaimed, personal assistants “cannot\neffectively voice their concerns about the organization of\nthe Home Services program, their role in the program, or\nthe terms and conditions of their employment under the\nProgram.” Ibid.\n   Several months later, the Illinois Legislature codified\nthat executive order by amending the PLRA. Pub. Act no.\n93–204, §5, 2003 Ill. Laws p. 1930. While acknowledging\n“the right of the persons receiving services . . . to hire and\nfire personal assistants or supervise them,” the Act de­\nclared personal assistants to be “public employees” of the\nState of Illinois—but “[s]olely for the purposes of coverage\nunder the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act.” Ill. Comp.\nStat., ch. 20, §2405/3(f ). The statute emphasized that\npersonal assistants are not state employees for any other\npurpose, “including but not limited to, purposes of vicari­\nous liability in tort and purposes of statutory retirement\nor health insurance benefits.” Ibid.\n   Following a vote, SEIU Healthcare Illinois & Indiana\n(SEIU–HII) was designated as the personal assistants’\nexclusive representative for purposes of collective bargain­\ning. See App. 23. The union and the State subsequently\nentered into collective-bargaining agreements that require\nall personal assistants who are not union members to pay\na “fair share” of the union dues. Id., at 24–25. These\npayments are deducted directly from the personal assis­\ntants’ Medicaid payments. Ibid. The record in this case\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nshows that each year, personal assistants in Illinois pay\nSEIU–HII more than $3.6 million in fees. Id., at 25.\n                              C\n   Three of the petitioners in the case now before us—\nTheresa Riffey, Susan Watts, and Stephanie Yencer­\nPrice—are personal assistants under the Rehabilitation\nProgram. They all provide in-home services to family\nmembers or other individuals suffering from disabilities.3\nSusan Watts, for example, serves as personal assistant for\nher daughter, who requires constant care due to quadri­\nplegic cerebral palsy and other conditions. See App. 18.\n   In 2010, these petitioners filed a putative class action on\nbehalf of all Rehabilitation Program personal assistants in\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District\nof Illinois. See 656 F. 3d 692, 696 (CA7 2011). Their\ncomplaint, which named the Governor and the union as\ndefendants, sought an injunction against enforcement of\nthe fair-share provision and a declaration that the Illinois\nPLRA violates the First Amendment insofar as it requires\npersonal assistants to pay a fee to a union that they do not\nwish to support. Ibid.\n   The District Court dismissed their claims with preju­\ndice, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed in relevant part,\nconcluding that the case was controlled by this Court’s\ndecision in Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. 431 U. S. 209\n(1977). 656 F. 3d, at 698. The Seventh Circuit held that\nIllinois and the customers who receive in-home care are\n“joint employers” of the personal assistants, and the court\nstated that it had “no difficulty concluding that the State\nemploys personal assistants within the meaning of\nAbood.” Ibid.\n   Petitioners sought certiorari. Their petition pointed out\n——————\n   3 The other five petitioners are personal assistants under a similar\n\nIllinois program called the “Disabilities Program.” See, infra, at 39–40,\nand n. 30.\n8                     HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat other States were following Illinois’ lead by enacting\nlaws or issuing executive orders that deem personal assis­\ntants to be state employees for the purpose of unionization\nand the assessment of fair-share fees. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 22a. Petitioners also noted that Illinois has enacted\na law that deems “individual maintenance home health\nworkers”—a category that includes registered nurses,\nlicensed practical nurses, and certain therapists who work\nin private homes—to be “public employees” for similar\npurposes. Ill. Pub. Act no. 97–1158, 2012 Ill. Laws p.\n7823.\n   In light of the important First Amendment questions\nthese laws raise, we granted certiorari. 570 U. S. ___\n(2013).\n                              II\n    In upholding the constitutionality of the Illinois law, the\nSeventh Circuit relied on this Court’s decision in Abood\nsupra, which held that state employees who choose not to\njoin a public-sector union may nevertheless be compelled\nto pay an agency fee to support union work that is related\nto the collective-bargaining process. Id., at 235–236. Two\nTerms ago, in Knox v. Service Employees, 567 U. S. ___\n(2012), we pointed out that Abood is “something of an\nanomaly.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11). “ ‘The primary\npurpose’ of permitting unions to collect fees from non­\nmembers,” we noted, “is ‘to prevent nonmembers from\nfree-riding on the union’s efforts, sharing the employment\nbenefits obtained by the union’s collective bargaining\nwithout sharing the costs incurred.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10) (quoting Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551\nU. S. 177, 181 (2007)). But “[s]uch free-rider arguments\n. . . are generally insufficient to overcome First Amend­\nment objections.” 567 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10–11).\n    For this reason, Abood stands out, but the State of\nIllinois now asks us to sanction what amounts to a very\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsignificant expansion of Abood—so that it applies, not just\nto full-fledged public employees, but also to others who are\ndeemed to be public employees solely for the purpose of\nunionization and the collection of an agency fee. Faced\nwith this argument, we begin by examining the path that\nled to this Court’s decision in Abood.\n                             A\n   The starting point was Railway Employes v. Hanson,\n351 U. S. 225 (1956), a case in which the First Amend­\nment was barely mentioned. The dispute in Hanson re­\nsulted from an amendment to the Railway Labor Act\n(RLA). Id., at 229, 232. As originally enacted in 1926, the\nAct did not permit a collective-bargaining agreement to\nrequire employees to join or make any payments to a\nunion. See Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 750 (1961).\nAt that time and for many years thereafter, there was “a\nstrong and long-standing tradition of voluntary unionism\non the part of the standard rail unions.” Ibid.\n   Eventually, however, the view of the unions changed.\nSee id., at 760–761. The RLA’s framework for resolving\nlabor disputes “is more complex than that of any other\nindustry,” id., at 755, and amendments enacted in 1934\nincreased the financial burden on unions by creating the\n36-member National Railroad Adjustment Board, one-half\nof whose members were appointed and paid by the unions.\nId., at 759–760. In seeking authorization to enter into\nunion-shop agreements, i.e., agreements requiring all\nemployees to join a union and thus pay union dues, see Oil\nWorkers, 426 U. S., at 409, n. 1, the unions’ principal\nargument “was based on their role in this regulatory\nframework.” Street, 367 U. S., at 761. A union spokesman\nargued that the financial burdens resulting from the Act’s\nunique and complex scheme justified union-shop provi­\nsions in order to provide the unions with needed dues.\nIbid.\n10                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  These arguments were successful, and the Act was\namended in 1951 to permit a railroad and a union to enter\ninto an agreement containing a union-shop provision.\nThis amendment brought the Act into conflict with the\nlaws of States that guaranteed the “right to work” and\nthereby outlawed the union shop. Nebraska, the setting of\nHanson, was one such State. 351 U. S., at 228.\n  In Hanson, the Union Pacific Railroad Company and its\nunionized workers entered into a collective-bargaining\nagreement that contained a provision requiring employ­\nees, “as a condition of their continued employment,” to join\nand remain members of the union. Id., at 227. Employees\nwho did not want to join the union brought suit in state\ncourt, contending that the union-shop provision violated a\nprovision of the Nebraska Constitution banning adverse\nemployment actions “ ‘because of refusal to join or affiliate\nwith a labor organization.’ ” Id., at 228 (quoting Neb.\nConst., Art. XV, §13). The employer countered that the\nRLA trumped the Nebraska provision, but the Nebraska\ncourts agreed with the employees and struck down the\nunion-shop agreement.\n  When the case reached this Court, the primary issue\nwas whether the provision of the RLA that authorized\nunion-shop agreements was “germane to the exercise of\npower under the Commerce Clause.” 351 U. S., at 234–\n235. In an opinion by Justice Douglas, the Court held that\nthis provision represented a permissible regulation of\ncommerce. The Court reasoned that the challenged provi­\nsion “ ‘stabilized labor-management relations’ ” and thus\nfurthered “ ‘industrial peace.’ ” Id., at 233–234.\n  The employees also raised what amounted to a facial\nconstitutional challenge to the same provision of the RLA.\nThe employees claimed that a “union shop agreement\nforces men into ideological and political associations which\nviolate their right to freedom of conscience, freedom of\nassociation, and freedom of thought protected by the Bill\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof Rights.” Id., at 236. But because the lawsuit had been\nfiled shortly after the collective-bargaining agreement was\napproved, the record contained no evidence that the union\nhad actually engaged in political or ideological activities.4\n   The Hanson Court dismissed the objecting employees’\nFirst Amendment argument with a single sentence. The\nCourt wrote: “On the present record, there is no more an\ninfringement or impairment of First Amendment rights\nthan there would be in the case of a lawyer who by state\nlaw is required to be a member of an integrated bar.” Id.,\nat 238.\n   This explanation was remarkable for two reasons. First,\nthe Court had never previously held that compulsory\nmembership in and the payment of dues to an integrated\nbar was constitutional, and the constitutionality of such a\nrequirement was hardly a foregone conclusion. Indeed,\nthat issue did not reach the Court until five years later,\nand it produced a plurality opinion and four separate\nwritings. See Lathrop v. Donohue, 367 U. S. 820 (1961)\n(plurality opinion).5\n   Second, in his Lathrop dissent, Justice Douglas, the\nauthor of Hanson, came to the conclusion that the First\nAmendment did not permit compulsory membership in an\nintegrated bar. See 367 U. S., at 878–880. The analogy\ndrawn in Hanson, he wrote, fails. “Once we approve this\nmeasure,” he warned, “we sanction a device where men\nand women in almost any profession or calling can be at\n\n——————\n   4 The employees’ First Amendment claim necessarily raised the ques­\n\ntion of governmental action, since the First Amendment does not\nrestrict private conduct, and the Hanson Court, in a brief passage,\nconcluded that governmental action was present. This was so, the\nCourt reasoned, because the union-shop provision of the RLA took away\na right that employees had previously enjoyed under state law. 351\nU. S., at 232–233.\n   5 A related question arose in Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1\n\n(1990), which we discuss infra, at 37–38.\n12                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nleast partially regimented behind causes which they op­\npose.” 367 U. S., at 884. He continued:\n     “I look on the Hanson case as a narrow exception to be\n     closely confined. Unless we so treat it, we practically\n     give carte blanche to any legislature to put at least\n     professional people into goose-stepping brigades.\n     Those brigades are not compatible with the First\n     Amendment.” Id., at 884–885 (footnote omitted).\n  The First Amendment analysis in Hanson was thin, and\nthe Court’s resulting First Amendment holding was nar­\nrow. As the Court later noted, “all that was held in Han­\nson was that [the RLA] was constitutional in its bare\nauthorization of union-shop contracts requiring workers to\ngive ‘financial support’ to unions legally authorized to act\nas their collective bargaining agents.” Street, 367 U. S., at\n749 (emphasis added). The Court did not suggest that\n“industrial peace” could justify a law that “forces men into\nideological and political associations which violate their\nright to freedom of conscience, freedom of association, and\nfreedom of thought,” or a law that forces a person to “con­\nform to [a union’s] ideology.” Hanson, supra, at 236–237.\nThe RLA did not compel such results, and the record in\nHanson did not show that this had occurred.\n                             B\n  Five years later, in Street, supra, the Court considered\nanother case in which workers objected to a union shop.\nEmployees of the Southern Railway System raised a First\nAmendment challenge, contending that a substantial part\nof the money that they were required to pay to the union\nwas used to support political candidates and causes with\nwhich they disagreed. A Georgia court enjoined the en­\nforcement of the union-shop provision and entered judg­\nment for the dissenting employees in the amount of the\npayments that they had been forced to make to the union.\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court affirmed. Id., at 742–745.\n   Reviewing the State Supreme Court’s decision, this\nCourt recognized that the case presented constitutional\nquestions “of the utmost gravity,” id., at 749, but the\nCourt found it unnecessary to reach those questions.\nInstead, the Court construed the RLA “as not vesting the\nunions with unlimited power to spend exacted money.”\nId., at 768. Specifically, the Court held, the Act “is to be\nconstrued to deny the unions, over an employee’s objec­\ntion, the power to use his exacted funds to support politi­\ncal causes which he opposes.” Id., at 768–769.\n   Having construed the RLA to contain this restriction,\nthe Street Court then went on to discuss the remedies\navailable for employees who objected to the use of union\nfunds for political causes. The Court suggested two: The\ndissenting employees could be given a refund of the por­\ntion of their dues spent by the union for political or ideo­\nlogical purposes, or they could be given a refund of the\nportion spent on those political purposes that they had\nadvised the union they disapproved.6 Id., at 774–775.\n   Justice Black, writing in dissent, objected to the Court’s\nsuggested remedies, and he accurately predicted that the\nCourt’s approach would lead to serious practical problems.\nId., at 796–797. That approach, he wrote, while “very\nlucrative to special masters, accountants and lawyers,”\nwould do little for “the individual workers whose First\nAmendment freedoms have been flagrantly violated.” Id.,\nat 796. He concluded:\n     “Unions composed of a voluntary membership, like all\n     other voluntary groups, should be free in this country\n     to fight in the public forum to advance their own\n——————\n  6 Only  four Justices fully agreed with this approach, but a fifth, Jus­\ntice Douglas, went along due to “the practical problem of mustering five\nJustices for a judgment in this case.” Id., at 778–779 (concurring\nopinion).\n14                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     causes, to promote their choice of candidates and par­\n     ties and to work for the doctrines or the laws they fa­\n     vor. But to the extent that Government steps in to\n     force people to help espouse the particular causes of a\n     group, that group—whether composed of railroad\n     workers or lawyers—loses its status as a voluntary\n     group.” Ibid.\n   Justice Frankfurter, joined by Justice Harlan, also\ndissented, arguing that the Court’s remedy was conceptu­\nally flawed because a union may further the objectives of\nmembers by political means. See id., at 813–815. He\nnoted, for example, that reports from the AFL–CIO Execu­\ntive Council “emphasize that labor’s participation in urg­\ning legislation and candidacies is a major one.” Id., at 813.\nIn light of “the detailed list of national and international\nproblems on which the AFL–CIO speaks,” he opined, “it\nseems rather naive” to believe “that economic and political\nconcerns are separable.” Id., at 814.\n                               C\n   This brings us to Abood, which, unlike Hanson and\nStreet, involved a public-sector collective-bargaining\nagreement. The Detroit Federation of Teachers served “as\nthe exclusive representative of teachers employed by the\nDetroit Board of Education.” 431 U. S., at 211–212. The\ncollective-bargaining agreement between the union and\nthe board contained an agency-shop clause requiring every\nteacher to “pay the Union a service charge equal to the\nregular dues required of Union members.” Id., at 212. A\nputative class of teachers sued to invalidate this clause.\nAsserting that “they opposed collective bargaining in the\npublic sector,” the plaintiffs argued that “ ‘a substantial\npart’ ” of their dues would be used to fund union “ ‘activi­\nties and programs which are economic, political, profes­\nsional, scientific and religious in nature of which Plaintiffs\ndo not approve, and in which they will have no voice.’ ”\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 212–213.\n   This Court treated the First Amendment issue as largely\nsettled by Hanson and Street. 431 U. S., at 217, 223.\nThe Court acknowledged that Street was resolved as a\nmatter of statutory construction without reaching any\nconstitutional issues, 431 U. S., at 220, and the Court\nrecognized that forced membership and forced contribu­\ntions impinge on free speech and associational rights, id.,\nat 223. But the Court dismissed the objecting teachers’\nconstitutional arguments with this observation: “[T]he\njudgment clearly made in Hanson and Street is that such\ninterference as exists is constitutionally justified by the\nlegislative assessment of the important contribution of the\nunion shop to the system of labor relations established by\nCongress.” Id., at 222.\n   The Abood Court understood Hanson and Street to have\nupheld union-shop agreements in the private sector based\non two primary considerations: the desirability of “labor\npeace” and the problem of “ ‘free riders[hip].’ ” 431 U. S., at\n220–222, 224.\n   The Court thought that agency-shop provisions promote\nlabor peace because the Court saw a close link between\nsuch provisions and the “principle of exclusive union rep­\nresentation.” Id., at 220. This principle, the Court ex­\nplained, “prevents inter-union rivalries from creating\ndissension within the work force and eliminating the\nadvantages to the employee of collectivization.” Id., at\n220–221. In addition, the Court noted, the “designation of\na single representative avoids the confusion that would\nresult from attempting to enforce two or more agreements\nspecifying different terms and conditions of employment.”\nId., at 220. And the Court pointed out that exclusive\nrepresentation “frees the employer from the possibility of\nfacing conflicting demands from different unions, and\npermits the employer and a single union to reach agree­\nments and settlements that are not subject to attack from\n16                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrival labor organizations.” Id., at 221.\n  Turning to the problem of free ridership, Abood noted\nthat a union must “ ‘fairly and equitably . . . represent all\nemployees’ ” regardless of union membership, and the\nCourt wrote as follows: The “union-shop arrangement has\nbeen thought to distribute fairly the cost of these activities\namong those who benefit, and it counteracts the incentive\nthat employees might otherwise have to become ‘free\nriders’ to refuse to contribute to the union while obtaining\nbenefits of union representation.” Id., at 221–222.\n  The plaintiffs in Abood argued that Hanson and Street\nshould not be given much weight because they did not\narise in the public sector, and the Court acknowledged\nthat public-sector bargaining is different from private­\nsector bargaining in some notable respects. 431 U. S., at\n227–228. For example, although public and private em­\nployers both desire to keep costs down, the Court recog­\nnized that a public employer “lacks an important disci­\npline against agreeing to increases in labor costs that in a\nmarket system would require price increases.” Id., at 228.\nThe Court also noted that “decisionmaking by a public\nemployer is above all a political process” undertaken by\npeople “ultimately responsible to the electorate.” Ibid.\nThus, whether a public employer accedes to a union’s\ndemands, the Court wrote, “will depend upon a blend of\npolitical ingredients,” thereby giving public employees\n“more influence in the decisionmaking process that is\npossessed by employees similarly organized in the private\nsector.” Ibid. But despite these acknowledged differences\nbetween private- and public-sector bargaining, the Court\ntreated Hanson and Street as essentially controlling.\n  Instead of drawing a line between the private and public\nsectors, the Abood Court drew a line between, on the one\nhand, a union’s expenditures for “collective-bargaining,\ncontract administration, and grievance-adjustment pur­\nposes,” 431 U. S., at 232, and, on the other, expenditures\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor political or ideological purposes. Id., at 236.\n                              D\n   The Abood Court’s analysis is questionable on several\ngrounds. Some of these were noted or apparent at or\nbefore the time of the decision, but several have become\nmore evident and troubling in the years since then.\n   The Abood Court seriously erred in treating Hanson and\nStreet as having all but decided the constitutionality of\ncompulsory payments to a public-sector union. As we have\nexplained, Street was not a constitutional decision at all,\nand Hanson disposed of the critical question in a single,\nunsupported sentence that its author essentially aban­\ndoned a few years later. Surely a First Amendment issue\nof this importance deserved better treatment.\n   The Abood Court fundamentally misunderstood the\nholding in Hanson, which was really quite narrow. As the\nCourt made clear in Street, “all that was held in Hanson\nwas that [the RLA] was constitutional in its bare authori­\nzation of union-shop contracts requiring workers to give\n‘financial support’ to unions legally authorized to act as\ntheir collective bargaining agents.” 367 U. S., at 749\n(emphasis added). In Abood, on the other hand, the State\nof Michigan did more than simply authorize the imposition\nof an agency fee. A state instrumentality, the Detroit\nBoard of Education, actually imposed that fee. This pre­\nsented a very different question.\n   Abood failed to appreciate the difference between the\ncore union speech involuntarily subsidized by dissenting\npublic-sector employees and the core union speech invol­\nuntarily funded by their counterparts in the private sec­\ntor. In the public sector, core issues such as wages, pen­\nsions, and benefits are important political issues, but that\nis generally not so in the private sector. In the years since\nAbood, as state and local expenditures on employee wages\nand benefits have mushroomed, the importance of the\n18                       HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndifference between bargaining in the public and private\nsectors has been driven home.7\n   Abood failed to appreciate the conceptual difficulty of\ndistinguishing in public-sector cases between union ex­\npenditures that are made for collective-bargaining pur­\nposes and those that are made to achieve political ends. In\nthe private sector, the line is easier to see. Collective\nbargaining concerns the union’s dealings with the em-\nployer; political advocacy and lobbying are directed at the\ngovernment. But in the public sector, both collective­\nbargaining and political advocacy and lobbying are di­\nrected at the government.\n   Abood does not seem to have anticipated the magnitude\nof the practical administrative problems that would result\nin attempting to classify public-sector union expenditures\nas either “chargeable” (in Abood’s terms, expenditures\nfor “collective-bargaining, contract administration, and\ngrievance-adjustment purposes,” id., at 232) or noncharge-\nable (i.e., expenditures for political or ideological purposes,\nid., at 236). In the years since Abood, the Court has strug­\ngled repeatedly with this issue. See Ellis v. Railway Clerks,\n466 U. S. 435 (1984); Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292\n(1986); Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507\n(1991); Locke v. Karass, 555 U. S. 207 (2009). In Lehnert,\nthe Court held that “chargeable activities must (1) be\n‘germane’ to collective-bargaining activity; (2) be justified\nby the government’s vital policy interest in labor peace\nand avoiding ‘free riders’; and (3) not significantly add to\nthe burdening of free speech that is inherent in the allow­\nance of an agency or union shop.” 500 U. S., at 519. But\nas noted in JUSTICE SCALIA’s dissent in that case, “each\n——————\n   7 Recent experience has borne out this concern.   See DiSalvo, The\nTrouble with Public Sector Unions, National Affairs No. 5, p. 15 (2010)\n(“In Illinois, for example, public-sector unions have helped create a\nsituation in which the state’s pension funds report a liability of more\nthan $100 billion, at least 50% of it unfunded”).\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\none of the three ‘prongs’ of the test involves a substantial\njudgment call (What is ‘germane’? What is ‘justified’?\nWhat is a ‘significant’ additional burden).” Id., at 551\n(opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in\npart).\n    Abood likewise did not foresee the practical problems\nthat would face objecting nonmembers. Employees who\nsuspect that a union has improperly put certain expenses\nin the “germane” category must bear a heavy burden if\nthey wish to challenge the union’s actions. “[T]he onus is\non the employees to come up with the resources to mount\nthe legal challenge in a timely fashion,” Knox, 567 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 19) (citing Lehnert, supra, at 513), and\nlitigating such cases is expensive. Because of the open­\nended nature of the Lehnert test, classifying particular\ncategories of expenses may not be straightforward. See\nJibson v. Michigan Ed. Assn.–NEA, 30 F. 3d 723, 730\n(CA6 1994)). And although Hudson required that a un­\nion’s books be audited, auditors do not themselves review\nthe correctness of a union’s categorization. See Knox,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 18–19) (citing Andrews v. Educa­\ntion Assn. of Cheshire, 829 F. 2d 335, 340 (CA2 1987)).\nSee also American Federation of Television and Recording\nArtists, Portland Local, 327 N. L. R. B. 474, 477 (1999) (“It\nis settled that determinations concerning whether particu­\nlar expenditures are chargeable are legal determinations\nwhich are outside the expertise of the auditor. Thus, as\nwe have stated, the function of the auditor is to verify that\nthe expenditures that the union claims it made were in\nfact made for the purposes claimed, not to pass on the\ncorrectness of the union’s allocation of expenditures to the\nchargeable and nonchargeable categories”); California\nSaw and Knife Works, 320 N. L. R. B. 224, 241 (1995) (“We\nfirst agree [that the company at issue] did not violate its\nduty of fair representation by failing to use an independ­\nent auditor to determine the allocation of chargeable and\n20                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnonchargeable expenditures”); Price v.

That function does not require that the\nauditor make a legal decision as to the appropriateness of\nthe allocation of expenses to the chargeable and non­\nchargeable categories”).\n  Finally, a critical pillar of the Abood Court’s analysis\nrests on an unsupported empirical assumption, namely,\nthat the principle of exclusive representation in the public\nsector is dependent on a union or agency shop. As we will\nexplain, see infra, at 31–34, this assumption is unwar­\nranted.\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n   Despite all this, the State of Illinois now asks us to\napprove a very substantial expansion of Abood’s reach.\nAbood involved full-fledged public employees, but in this\ncase, the status of the personal assistants is much differ­\nent. The Illinois Legislature has taken pains to specify\nthat personal assistants are public employees for one\npurpose only: collective bargaining. For all other pur­\nposes, Illinois regards the personal assistants as private­\nsector employees. This approach has important practical\nconsequences.\n   For one thing, the State’s authority with respect to these\ntwo groups is vastly different. In the case of full-fledged\npublic employees, the State establishes all of the duties\nimposed on each employee, as well as all of the qualifica­\ntions needed for each position. The State vets applicants\nand chooses the employees to be hired. The State provides\nor arranges for whatever training is needed, and it super­\nvises and evaluates the employees’ job performance and\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nimposes corrective measures if appropriate. If a state\nemployee’s performance is deficient, the State may dis­\ncharge the employee in accordance with whatever proce­\ndures are required by law.\n   With respect to the personal assistants involved in this\ncase, the picture is entirely changed. The job duties of\npersonal assistants are specified in their individualized\nService Plans, which must be approved by the customer\nand the customer’s physician.         89 Ill. Admin. Code\n§684.10. Customers have complete discretion to hire any\npersonal assistant who meets the meager basic qualifica­\ntions that the State prescribes in §686.10. See §676.30(b)\n(the customer “is responsible for controlling all aspects of\nthe employment relationship between the customer and\nthe [personal assistant], including, without limitation,\nlocating and hiring the [personal assistant]” (emphasis\nadded)); §684.20(b) (“complete discretion in which Per-\nsonal Assistant [the customer] wishes to hire” subject to\nbaseline eligibility requirements).\n   Customers supervise their personal assistants on a daily\nbasis, and no provision of the Illinois statute or imple­\nmenting regulations gives the State the right to enter the\nhome in which the personal assistant is employed for the\npurpose of checking on the personal assistant’s job per­\nformance. Cf. §676.20(b) (customer controls “without\nlimitation . . . supervising the work performed by the\n[personal assistant], imposing . . . disciplinary action\nagainst the [personal assistant]”). And while state law\nmandates an annual review of each personal assistant’s\nwork, that evaluation is also controlled by the customer.\n§§686.10(k), 686.30. A state counselor is assigned to assist\nthe customer in performing the review but has no power to\noverride the customer’s evaluation. See ibid. Nor do the\nregulations empower the State to discharge a personal\nassistant for substandard performance. See n. 1, supra.\nDischarge, like hiring, is entirely in the hands of the cus­\n22                       HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntomer. See §676.30.\n   Consistent with this scheme, under which personal\nassistants are almost entirely answerable to the customers\nand not to the State, Illinois withholds from personal\nassistants most of the rights and benefits enjoyed by full­\nfledged state employees. As we have noted already, state\nlaw explicitly excludes personal assistants from statutory\nretirement and health insurance benefits. Ill. Comp. Stat.,\nch. 20, §2405/3(f ). It also excludes personal assistants\nfrom group life insurance and certain other employee\nbenefits provided under the State Employees Group In­\nsurance Act of 1971. Ibid. (“Personal assistants shall not\nbe covered by the State Employees Group Insurance Act of\n1971”). And the State “does not provide paid vacation,\nholiday, or sick leave” to personal assistants. 89 Ill. Ad­\nmin. Code §686.10(h)(7).\n   Personal assistants also appear to be ineligible for a\nhost of benefits under a variety of other state laws, includ­\ning the State Employee Vacation Time Act (see Ill. Stat.,\nch. 5, §360/1); the State Employee Health Savings Account\nLaw (see Ill. Stat., ch. 5, §377/10–1); the State Employee\nJob Sharing Act (see Ill. Stat., ch. 5, §380/0.01); the State\nEmployee Indemnification Act (see Ill. Stat., ch. 5, §350/2);\nand the Sick Leave Bank Act. See Ill. Stat., ch. 5, §400/1.\nPersonal assistants are apparently not entitled to the\nprotection that the Illinois Whistleblower Act provides for\nfull-fledged state employees. See Ill. Stat., ch. 740, §174/1.\nAnd it likewise appears that personal assistants are shut\nout of many other state employee programs and benefits.\nThe Illinois Department of Central Management Services\nlists many such programs and benefits, including a de­\nferred compensation program, full worker’s compensation\nprivileges,8 behavioral health programs, a program that\n——————\n  8 Under §686.10(h)(9), a personal assistant “may apply for Workers'\n\nCompensation benefits through [the State] . . . however, . . . the cus­\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, §2405/3(f ).\n   Just as the State denies personal assistants most of the\nrights and benefits enjoyed by full-fledged state workers,\nthe State does not assume responsibility for actions taken\nby personal assistants during the course of their employ­\nment. The governing statute explicitly disclaims “vicari­\nous liability in tort.” Ibid. So if a personal assistant steals\nfrom a customer, neglects a customer, or abuses a customer,\nthe State washes its hands.\n   Illinois deems personal assistants to be state employees\nfor one purpose only, collective bargaining,10 but the scope\nof bargaining that may be conducted on their behalf is\nsharply limited. Under the governing Illinois statute,\ncollective bargaining can occur only for “terms and condi­\ntions of employment that are within the State’s control.”\nIll. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, §2405/3(f ). That is not very much.\n   As an illustration, consider the subjects of mandatory\nbargaining under federal and state labor law that are out\n\n——————\ntomer, not DHS, is the employer for these purposes.”\n  9 See www2.illinois.gov/cms/Employees/benefits/StateEmployee/Pages/\n\ndefault.\n  10 What is significant is not the label that the State assigns to the\n\npersonal assistants but the substance of their relationship to the\ncustomers and the State. Our decision rests in no way on state-law\nlabels. Cf. post, at 10. Indeed, it is because the First Amendment’s\nmeaning does not turn on state-law labels that we refuse to allow the\nstate to make a nonemployee a full-fledged employee “[s]olely for\npurposes of coverage under the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act,” Ill.\nComp. Stat., ch. 20, §2405/3(f), through the use of a statutory label.\n24                       HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n of bounds when it comes to personal assistants. Under\nfederal law, mandatory subjects include the days of the\nweek and the hours of the day during which an employee\nmust work,11 lunch breaks,12 holidays,13 vacations,14 ter­\nmination of employment,15 and changes in job duties.16\nIllinois law similarly makes subject to mandatory collective­\nbargaining decisions concerning the “hours and terms and\nconditions of employment.” Belvidere v. Illinois State\nLabor Relations Bd., 181 Ill. 2d 191, 201, 692 N. E. 2d 295,\n301 (1998); see also, e.g., Aurora Sergeants Assn., 24 PERI\n¶25 (2008) (holding that days of the week worked by police\nofficers is subject to mandatory collective bargaining). But\nunder the Rehabilitation Program, all these topics are\ngoverned by the Service Plan, with respect to which the\nunion has no role. See §676.30(b) (the customer “is re­\nsponsible for controlling all aspects of the employment\nrelationship between the customer and the PA, including,\nwithout limitation, locating and hiring the PA, training\nthe PA, directing, evaluating, and otherwise supervising\nthe work performed by the PA, imposing . . . disciplinary\naction against the PA, and terminating the employment\nrelationship between the customer and the PA”); §684.50\n(the Service Plan must specify “the frequency with which\nthe specific tasks are to be provided” and “the number of\nhours each task is to be provided per month”).\n                               B\n                               1\n     The unusual status of personal assistants has important\n——————\n  11 See Meat Cutters v.

Abood’s rationale,\nwhatever its strengths and weaknesses, is based on the\nassumption that the union possesses the full scope of\npowers and duties generally available under American\nlabor law. Under the Illinois scheme now before us, how­\never, the union’s powers and duties are sharply circum­\nscribed, and as a result, even the best argument for the\n“extraordinary power” that Abood allows a union to wield,\nsee Davenport, 551 U. S., at 184, is a poor fit.\n  In our post-Abood cases involving public-sector agency­\nfee issues, Abood has been a given, and our task has been\nto attempt to understand its rationale and to apply it in a\nway that is consistent with that rationale. In that vein,\nAbood’s reasoning has been described as follows. The\nmere fact that nonunion members benefit from union\nspeech is not enough to justify an agency fee because\n“private speech often furthers the interests of nonspeak­\ners, and that does not alone empower the state to compel\nthe speech to be paid for.” Lehnert, 500 U. S., at 556\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.). What justifies the agency fee, the\nargument goes, is the fact that the State compels the\nunion to promote and protect the interests of nonmembers.\nIbid. Specifically, the union must not discriminate be­\ntween members and nonmembers in “negotiating and\nadministering a collective-bargaining agreement and\nrepresenting the interests of employees in settling dis­\nputes and processing grievances.” Ibid. This means that\nthe union “cannot, for example, negotiate particularly high\nwage increases for its members in exchange for accepting\nno increases for others.” Ibid. And it has the duty to\nprovide equal and effective representation for nonmem­\nbers in grievance proceedings, see Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann.,\nch. 5, §§315/6, 315/8, an undertaking that can be very\ninvolved. See, e.g., SEIU: Member Resources, available at\nwww.seiu.or /a/members /disputes-and-grievances-rights­\nprocedures-and-best-practices.php (detailing the steps\n26                        HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninvolved in adjusting grievances).\n   This argument has little force in the situation now\nbefore us. Illinois law specifies that personal assistants\n“shall be paid at the hourly rate set by law,” see 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code §686.40(a), and therefore the union cannot\nbe in the position of having to sacrifice higher pay for its\nmembers in order to protect the nonmembers whom it is\nobligated to represent. And as for the adjustment of\ngrievances, the union’s authority and responsibilities are\nnarrow, as we have seen. The union has no authority with\nrespect to any grievances that a personal assistant may\nhave with a customer, and the customer has virtually\ncomplete control over a personal assistant’s work.\n   The union’s limited authority in this area has important\npractical implications. Suppose, for example that a cus­\ntomer fires a personal assistant because the customer\nwrongly believes that the assistant stole a fork. Or sup­\npose that a personal assistant is discharged because the\nassistant shows no interest in the customer’s favorite\ndaytime soaps. Can the union file a grievance on behalf of\nthe assistant? The answer is no.\n   It is true that Illinois law requires a collective­\nbargaining agreement to “contain a grievance resolution\nprocedure which shall apply to all employees in the bar­\ngaining unit,” Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 5, §315/8, but in the\nsituation here, this procedure appears to relate solely to\nany grievance that a personal assistant may have with the\nState,17 not with the customer for whom the personal\n——————\n  17 Under  the current collective-bargaining agreement, a “grievance” is\n“a dispute regarding the meaning or implementation of a specific\nprovision brought by the Union or a Personal Assistant.” App. 51; see\nalso id., at 51–54. “Neither the Union nor the Personal Assistant can\ngrieve the hiring or termination of the Personal Assistant, reduction in\nthe number of hours worked by the Personal Assistant or assigned to\nthe Customer, and/or any action taken by the Customer.” Id., at 51.\nThat apparently limits the union’s role in grievance adjustments to the\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Extending\nthose boundaries to encompass partial-public employees,\nquasi-public employees, or simply private employees\n——————\nState’s failure to perform its duties under the collective-bargaining\nagreement, e.g., if the State were to issue an incorrect paycheck, the\nunion could bring a grievance. See id., at 48\n   18 Contrary to the dissent’s argument, post, at 10–11, the scope of the\n\nunion’s bargaining authority has an important bearing on the question\nwhether Abood should be extended to the situation now before us. As\nwe have explained, the best argument that can be mounted in support\nof Abood is based on the fact that a union, in serving as the exclusive\nrepresentative of all the employees in a bargaining unit, is required by\nlaw to engage in certain activities that benefit nonmembers and that\nthe union would not undertake if it did not have a legal obligation to do\nso. But where the law withholds from the union the authority to\nengage in most of those activities, the argument for Abood is weakened.\nHere, the dissent does not claim that the union’s approach to negotia­\ntions on wages or benefits would be any different if it were not required\nto negotiate on behalf of the nonmembers as well as members. And\nthere is no dispute that the law does not require the union to undertake\nthe burden of representing personal assistants with respect to their\ngrievances with customers; on the contrary, the law entirely excludes\nthe union from that process. The most that the dissent can identify is\nthe union’s obligation to represent nonmembers regarding grievances\nwith the State, but since most aspects of the personal assistants’ work\nis controlled entirely by the customers, this obligation is relatively\nslight. It bears little resemblance to the obligation imposed on the\nunion in Abood.\n   19 It is therefore unnecessary for us to reach petitioners’ argument\n\nthat Abood should be overruled, and the dissent’s extended discussion\nof stare decisis is beside the point. Cf. Stoneridge Investment Partners,\nLLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 164–166 (2008) (declining\nto extend the “implied” right of action under §10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act “beyond its present boundaries”).\n28                        HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwould invite problems. Consider a continuum, ranging, on\nthe one hand, from full-fledged state employees to, on the\nother hand, individuals who follow a common calling and\nbenefit from advocacy or lobbying conducted by a group to\nwhich they do not belong and pay no dues. A State may\nnot force every person who benefits from this group’s\nefforts to make payments to the group. See Lehnert, 500\nU. S., at 556 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But what if regula­\ntion of this group is increased? What if the Federal Gov­\nernment or a State begins to provide or increases subsidies\nin this area? At what point, short of the point at which\nthe individuals in question become full-fledged state em­\nployees, should Abood apply?\n   If respondents’ and the dissent’s views were adopted, a\nhost of workers who receive payments from a governmen­\ntal entity for some sort of service would be candidates for\ninclusion within Abood’s reach. Medicare-funded home\nhealth employees may be one such group. See Brief for\nPetitioners 51; 42 U. S. C. §1395x(m); 42 CFR §424.22(a).\nThe same goes for adult foster care providers in Oregon\n(Ore. Rev. Stat. §443.733 (2013)) and Washington (Wash.\nRev. Code §41.56.029 (2012)) and certain workers under\nthe federal Child Care and Development Fund programs\n(45 CFR §98.2).\n   If we allowed Abood to be extended to those who are not\nfull-fledged public employees, it would be hard to see just\nwhere to draw the line,20 and we therefore confine Abood’s\n——————\n   20 The dissent suggests that the concept of joint employment already\n\nsupplies a clear line of demarcation, see post, at 8–9, but absent a clear\nstatutory definition, employer status is generally determined based on\na variety of factors that often do not provide a clear answer.

S., at ___ (slip op. at 8–9); see also, e.g., R.A.V. v. St.\nPaul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992); Riley v. National Federa­\ntion of Blind of N.C., 487 U.

And “com­\npelled funding of the speech of other private speakers or\ngroups” presents the same dangers as compelled speech.\nKnox, supra, at ___ (slip op. at 9). As a result, we ex­\nplained in Knox that an agency-fee provision imposes “a\n‘significant impingement on First Amendment rights,’ ”\nand this cannot be tolerated unless it passes “exacting\nFirst Amendment scrutiny.” 567 U. S., at ___ (slip op. at\n9–10).\n   In Knox, we considered specific features of an agency­\nshop agreement—allowing a union to impose upon non­\nmembers a special assessment or dues increase without\nproviding notice and without obtaining the nonmembers’\n——————\ncontexts. What matters here is whether the relationship between the\nState and the personal assistants is sufficient to bring this case within\nAbood’s reach.\n  21 The dissent claims that our refusal to extend Abood to the Rehabili­\n\ntation Program personal assistants produces a “perverse result” by\npenalizing the State for giving customers extensive control over the\ncare they receive. Post, at 12. But it is not at all perverse to recognize\nthat a State may exercise more control over its full-fledged employees\nthan it may over those who are not full-fledged state employees or are\nprivately employed.\n30                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naffirmative agreement—and we held that these features\ncould not even satisfy the standard employed in United\nStates v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405, 415 (2001),\nwhere we struck down a provision that compelled the\nsubsidization of commercial speech. We did not suggest,\nhowever, that the compelled speech in Knox was like the\ncommercial speech in United Foods. On the contrary, we\nobserved that “[t]he subject of the speech at issue [in\nUnited Foods]—promoting the sale of mushrooms—was\nnot one that is likely to stir the passions of many, but the\nmundane commercial nature of that speech only high­\nlights the importance of our analysis and our holding.”\nKnox, supra, at ___ (slip op. at 9).\n   While the features of the agency-fee provision in Knox\ncould not meet even the commercial-speech standard\nemployed in United Foods, it is apparent that the speech\ncompelled in this case is not commercial speech. Our\nprecedents define commercial speech as “speech that does\nno more than propose a commercial transaction,” United\nFoods, supra, at 409 (citing Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v.\nVirginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S.\n748, 761–762 (1976)), and the union speech in question in\nthis case does much more than that. As a consequence,\nit is arguable that the United Foods standard is too\npermissive.\n                                 B\n   For present purposes, however, no fine parsing of levels\nof First Amendment scrutiny is needed because the agency­\nfee provision here cannot satisfy even the test used in\nKnox. Specifically, this provision does not serve a “ ‘com­\npelling state interes[t] . . . that cannot be achieved through\nmeans significantly less restrictive of associational free­\ndoms.’ ” Knox, supra, at ___ (slip op. at 10) (quoting Rob­\nerts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623 (1984)).\nRespondents contend that the agency-fee provision in this\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

Nor do they challenge\nthe authority of the SEIU–HII to serve as the exclusive\nrepresentative of all the personal assistants in bargaining\nwith the State. All they seek is the right not to be\nforced to contribute to the union, with which they broadly\ndisagree.\n   A union’s status as exclusive bargaining agent and the\nright to collect an agency fee from non-members are not\ninextricably linked. For example, employees in some\nfederal agencies may choose a union to serve as the exclu­\nsive bargaining agent for the unit, but no employee is\nrequired to join the union or to pay any union fee. Under\nfederal law, in agencies in which unionization is permit­\nted, “[e]ach employee shall have the right to form, join, or\nassist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such\nactivity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and\neach employee shall be protected in the exercise of such\nright.” 5 U. S. C. §7102 (emphasis added).22\n   Moreover, even if the agency fee provision at issue here\nwere tied to the union’s status as exclusive bargaining\nagents, features of the Illinois scheme would still under­\nmine the argument that the agency fee plays an important\nrole in maintaining labor peace. For one thing, any threat\nto labor peace is diminished because the personal assis­\n\n——————\n  22 A similar statute adopts the same rule specifically as to the U. S.\n\nPostal Service. See 39 U. S. C. §1209(c).\n32                       HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntants do not work together in a common state facility but\ninstead spend all their time in private homes, either the\ncustomers’ or their own. Cf. Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local\nEducators’ Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 51 (1983) (“[E]xclusion of\nthe rival union may reasonably be considered a means of\ninsuring labor-peace within the schools”). Federal labor\nlaw reflects the fact that the organization of household\nworkers like the personal assistants does not further the\ninterest of labor peace. “[A]ny individual employed . . . in\nthe domestic service of any family or person at his home”\nis excluded from coverage under the National Labor Rela­\ntions Act. See 29 U. S. C. §152(3).\n   The union’s very restricted role under the Illinois law\nis also significant. Since the union is largely limited to\npetitioning the State for greater pay and benefits, the\nspecter of conflicting demands by personal assistants is\nlessened. And of course, State officials must deal on a\ndaily basis with conflicting pleas for funding in many\ncontexts.\n                            2\n  Respondents also maintain that the agency-fee provision\npromotes the welfare of personal assistants and thus\ncontributes to the success of the Rehabilitation Program.\nAs a result of unionization, they claim, the wages and\nbenefits of personal assistants have been substantially\nimproved;23 orientation and training programs, back­\nground checks, and a program to deal with lost and erro­\nneous paychecks have been instituted;24 and a procedure\nwas established to resolve grievances arising under the\ncollective-bargaining agreement (but apparently not\n——————\n  23 Wages rose from $7 per hour in 2003 to $13 per hour in 2014.

The agency-fee provision cannot be sustained\nunless the cited benefits for personal assistants could not\nhave been achieved if the union had been required to\ndepend for funding on the dues paid by those personal\nassistants who chose to join. No such showing has been\nmade.\n   In claiming that the agency fee was needed to bring\nabout the cited improvements, the State is in a curious\nposition. The State is not like the closed-fisted employer\nthat is bent on minimizing employee wages and benefits\nand that yields only grudgingly under intense union pres­\nsure. As Governor Blagojevich put it in the executive\norder that first created the Illinois program, the State took\nthe initiative because it was eager for “feedback” regard­\ning the needs and views of the personal assistants. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 46. Thereafter, a majority of the\npersonal assistants voted to unionize. When they did so,\nthey must have realized that this would require the pay­\nment of union dues, and therefore it may be presumed\nthat a high percentage of these personal assistants became\nunion members and are willingly paying union dues. Why\nare these dues insufficient to enable the union to provide\n“feedback” to a State that is highly receptive to sugges­\ntions for increased wages and other improvements? A host\nof organizations advocate on behalf of the interests of\npersons falling within an occupational group, and many of\nthese groups are quite successful even though they are\ndependent on voluntary contributions.

Board of\nEd. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391\nU. S. 563 (1968). See Brief for Respondent Quinn 25–26;\nBrief for SEIU–HII 35–36; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 11. And they claim that under the Picker­\ning analysis, the Illinois scheme must be sustained. This\nargument represents an effort to find a new justification\nfor the decision in Abood, because neither in that case nor\nin any subsequent related case have we seen Abood as\nbased on Pickering balancing.26\n  In any event, this effort to recast Abood falls short. To\nbegin, the Pickering test is inapplicable because with\nrespect to the personal assistants, the State is not acting\nin a traditional employer role.27 But even if it were, appli­\n——————\n  26 The  Abood majority cited Pickering once, in a footnote, for the prop­\nosition that “there may be limits on the extent to which an employee in\na sensitive or policymaking position may freely criticize his superiors\nand the policies they espouse.” 431 U. S., at 230, n. 27. And it was\ncited once in Justice Powell’s concurrence, for the uncontroversial\nproposition that “ ‘the State has interests as an employer in regulating\nthe speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it pos­\nsesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in\ngeneral.’ ” Id., at 259 (opinion concurring in judgment) (quoting Picker­\ning, 391 U. S., at 568). United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S.\n405 (2001), cited Pickering only once—in dissent. 533 U. S., at 425\n(opinion of BREYER, J.). Neither Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468\nU. S. 609 (1984), nor Knox cited Pickering a single time.\n   27 Nor is the State acting as a “proprietor in managing its internal\n\noperations” with respect to personal assistants. See NASA v. Nelson,\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

Under those cases, employee speech is unprotected\nif it is not on a matter of public concern (or is pursuant\nto an employee’s job duties), but speech on matters of\npublic concern may be restricted only if “the interest of the\nstate, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the\npublic services it performs through its employees” out­\nweighs “the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in\ncommenting upon matters of public concern.” 391 U. S., at\n568. See also Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri, 564 U. S.\n___ (2011); Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410 (2006);\nWaters v. Churchill, 511 U. S. 661, 674 (1994) (plurality\nopinion); Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983).\n   Attempting to fit Abood into the Pickering framework,\nthe United States contends that union speech that is\ngermane to collective bargaining does not address matters\nof public concern and, as a result, is not protected. Taking\nup this argument, the dissent insists that the speech at\nissue here is not a matter of public concern. According to\nthe dissent, this is “the prosaic stuff of collective bargain­\ning.” Post, at 9. Does it have any effect on the public?\nThe dissent’s answer is: “not terribly much.” Post, at 20.\nAs the dissent sees it, speech about such funding is not\nqualitatively different from the complaints of a small-town\npolice chief regarding such matters as the denial of $338\nin overtime pay or directives concerning the use of police\nvehicles and smoking in the police station.

The $338 payment at\nissue in Guarnieri had a negligible impact on public coffers, but pay­\n36                         HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   This argument flies in the face of reality. In this case,\nfor example, the category of union speech that is germane\nto collective bargaining unquestionably includes speech in\nfavor of increased wages and benefits for personal assis­\ntants. Increased wages and benefits for personal assis­\ntants would almost certainly mean increased expenditures\nunder the Medicaid program, and it is impossible to argue\nthat the level of Medicaid funding (or, for that matter,\nstate spending for employee benefits in general) is not a\nmatter of great public concern.\n   In recent years, Medicaid expenditures have represented\nnearly a quarter of all state expenditures. See National\nAssociation of State Budget Officers, Summary: Fall 2013\nFiscal Survey of States (Dec. 10, 2013), online at http://\nwww.nasbo.org. “Medicaid has steadily eaten up a grow­\ning share of state budgets.”29 In fiscal year 2014, “[t]hirty­\nfive states increased spending for Medicaid for a net in­\ncrease of $6.8 billion.” Ibid. Accordingly, speech by a\npowerful union that relates to the subject of Medicaid\nfunding cannot be equated with the sort of speech that our\ncases have treated as concerning matters of only private\nconcern. See, e.g., San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77 (2004)\n(per curiam); Connick, supra, at 148 (speech that “re­\nflect[ed] one employee’s dissatisfaction with a transfer and\nan attempt to turn that displeasure into a cause célèbre”\n(emphasis added)).\n   For this reason, if Pickering were to be applied, it would\n\n——————\nments made to public-sector bargaining units may have massive\nimplications for government spending. See supra, at 18, and n. 7. That\nis why the dissent’s “analogy,” post, at 20–21, is not illustrative at all.\nWe do not doubt that a single public employee’s pay is usually not a\nmatter of public concern. But when the issue is pay for an entire\ncollective-bargaining unit involving millions of dollars, that matter\naffects statewide budgeting decisions.\n   29 See Cooper, Bigger Share of State Cash for Medicaid, N. Y. Times,\n\nDec. 14, 2011.\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

Agency-fee provi­\nsions unquestionably impose a heavy burden on the First\nAmendment interests of objecting employees. See Knox,\n567 U. S., at ___ (slip op. at 19) (citing Lehnert, 500 U. S.,\nat 513; Jibson v. Michigan Ed. Assn., 30 F. 3d 723, 730\n(CA6 1994). And on the other side of the balance, the\narguments on which the United States relies—relating to\nthe promotion of labor peace and the problem of free rid­\ners—have already been discussed. Thus, even if the per­\nmissibility of the agency-shop provision in the collective­\nbargaining agreement now at issue were analyzed under\nPickering, that provision could not be upheld.\n                             B\n  Respondents contend, finally, that a refusal to extend\nAbood to cover the situation presented in this case will call\ninto question our decisions in Keller v. State Bar of Cal.\n496 U. S. 1 (1990), and Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.\nSystem v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217 (2000). Respondents\nare mistaken.\n  In Keller, we considered the constitutionality of a rule\napplicable to all members of an “integrated” bar, i.e., “an\nassociation of attorneys in which membership and dues\nare required as a condition of practicing law.” 496 U. S.,\nat 5. We held that members of this bar could not be re­\nquired to pay the portion of bar dues used for political or\nideological purposes but that they could be required to pay\nthe portion of the dues used for activities connected with\n38                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproposing ethical codes and disciplining bar members. Id.,\nat 14.\n  This decision fits comfortably within the framework\napplied in the present case. Licensed attorneys are sub­\nject to detailed ethics rules, and the bar rule requiring the\npayment of dues was part of this regulatory scheme. The\nportion of the rule that we upheld served the “State’s\ninterest in regulating the legal profession and improving\nthe quality of legal services.” Ibid. States also have a\nstrong interest in allocating to the members of the bar,\nrather than the general public, the expense of ensuring\nthat attorneys adhere to ethical practices. Thus, our\ndecision in this case is wholly consistent with our holding\nin Keller.\n  Contrary to respondents’ submission, the same is true\nwith respect to Southworth, supra. In that case, we up­\nheld the constitutionality of a university-imposed manda­\ntory student activities fee that was used in part to support\na wide array of student groups that engaged in expressive\nactivity. The mandatory fee was challenged by students\nwho objected to some of the expression that the fee was\nused to subsidize, but we rejected that challenge, and our\nholding is entirely consistent with our decision in this\ncase.\n  Public universities have a compelling interest in pro­\nmoting student expression in a manner that is viewpoint\nneutral. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of\nVa., 515 U. S. 819 (1995). This may be done by providing\nfunding for a broad array of student groups. If the groups\nfunded are truly diverse, many students are likely to\ndisagree with things that are said by some groups. And if\nevery student were entitled to a partial exemption from\nthe fee requirement so that no portion of the student’s fee\nwent to support a group that the student did not wish to\nsupport, the administrative problems would likely be\ninsuperable. Our decision today thus does not undermine\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

The First Amendment prohibits the\ncollection of an agency fee from personal assistants in the\nRehabilitation Program who do not want to join or support\nthe union.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part\nand affirmed in part,30 and the case is remanded for fur­\nther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\n\n——————\n   30 The Court of Appeals held—and we agree—that the First Amend­\n\nment claims of the petitioners who work, not in the Rehabilitation\nProgram, but in a different but related program, the “Disabilities\nProgram,” are not ripe. This latter program is similar in its basic\nstructure to the Rehabilitation Program, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a,\nbut the Disabilities Program personal assistants have not yet union­\nized. The Disabilities Program petitioners claim that under Illinois\nExecutive Order No. 2009–15, they face imminent unionization and,\nalong with it, compulsory dues payments. Executive Order No. 2009–\n15, they note, is “almost identical to EO 2003–08, except that it targets\nproviders in the Disabilities Program.” Brief for Petitioners 10.\n   In a 2009 mail-ballot election, the Disabilities Program personal\nassistants voted down efforts by SEIU Local 73 and American Federa­\ntion State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31 to become\ntheir representatives. See App. 27. The record before us does not\nsuggest that there are any further elections currently scheduled.

PAT QUINN,\n        GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 30, 2014] \n\n\n  JUSTICE    KAGAN, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG,\nJUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join,\ndissenting.\n   Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977), an-\nswers the question presented in this case. Abood held that\na government entity may, consistently with the First\nAmendment, require public employees to pay a fair share\nof the cost that a union incurs negotiating on their behalf\nfor better terms of employment. That is exactly what\nIllinois did in entering into collective bargaining agree-\nments with the Service Employees International Union\nHealthcare (SEIU) which included fair-share provisions.\nContrary to the Court’s decision, those agreements fall\nsquarely within Abood’s holding. Here, Illinois employs,\njointly with individuals suffering from disabilities, the in-\nhome care providers whom the SEIU represents. Illinois\nestablishes, following negotiations with the union, the\nmost important terms of their employment, including\nwages, benefits, and basic qualifications. And Illinois’s\ninterests in imposing fair-share fees apply no less to those\ncaregivers than to other state workers. The petitioners’\nchallenge should therefore fail.\n   And that result would fully comport with our decisions\napplying the First Amendment to public employment.\nAbood is not, as the majority at one point describes it,\n2                     HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n“something of an anomaly,” allowing uncommon interfer-\nence with individuals’ expressive activities. Ante, at 8.\nRather, the lines it draws and the balance it strikes reflect\nthe way courts generally evaluate claims that a condition\nof public employment violates the First Amendment. Our\ndecisions have long afforded government entities broad\nlatitude to manage their workforces, even when that\naffects speech they could not regulate in other contexts.\nAbood is of a piece with all those decisions: While protect-\ning an employee’s most significant expression, that deci-\nsion also enables the government to advance its interests\nin operating effectively—by bargaining, if it so chooses,\nwith a single employee representative and preventing free\nriding on that union’s efforts.\n   For that reason, one aspect of today’s opinion is cause\nfor satisfaction, though hardly applause. As this case\ncame to us, the principal question it presented was whether\nto overrule Abood: The petitioners devoted the lion’s\nshare of their briefing and argument to urging us to over-\nturn that nearly 40-year-old precedent (and the respond-\nents and amici countered in the same vein). Today’s\nmajority cannot resist taking potshots at Abood, see ante,\nat 17–20, but it ignores the petitioners’ invitation to de-\npart from principles of stare decisis. And the essential\nwork in the majority’s opinion comes from its extended\n(though mistaken) distinction of Abood, see ante, at 20–28,\nnot from its gratuitous dicta critiquing Abood’s founda-\ntions. That is to the good—or at least better than it might\nbe. The Abood rule is deeply entrenched, and is the foun-\ndation for not tens or hundreds, but thousands of contracts\nbetween unions and governments across the Nation. Our\nprecedent about precedent, fairly understood and applied,\nmakes it impossible for this Court to reverse that decision.\n                           I\n    I begin where this case should also end—with this\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nCourt’s decision in Abood. There, some public school\nteachers in Detroit challenged a clause in their collective\nbargaining agreement compelling non-union members to\npay the union a service charge equivalent to regular dues.\nThe Court upheld the requirement so long as the union\nwas using the money for “collective bargaining, contract\nadministration, and grievance adjustment,” rather than\nfor political or ideological activities. 431 U. S., at 225–226.\nIn so doing, the Court acknowledged that such a fair-share\nprovision “has an impact upon [public employees’] First\nAmendment interests”; employees, after all, might object\nto policies adopted or “activities undertaken by the union\nin its role as exclusive representative.” Id., at 222. Still,\nthe Court thought, the government’s own interests “consti-\ntutionally justified” the interference. Ibid. Detroit had\ndecided, the Court explained, that bargaining with a\nsingle employee representative would promote “labor\nstability” and peaceful labor relations—by ensuring, for\nexample, that different groups of employees did not pre-\nsent “conflicting demands.” Id., at 221, 229. And because\nsuch an exclusive bargaining agent has a legal duty to\nrepresent all employees, rather than just its own mem-\nbers, a compulsory surcharge fairly distributes “the cost of\n[bargaining] among those who benefit” and “counteracts\nthe incentive that employees might otherwise have to\nbecome ‘free riders.’ ” Id., at 222.\n  This case thus raises a straightforward question: Does\nAbood apply equally to Illinois’s care providers as to De-\ntroit’s teachers? No one thinks that the fair-share provi-\nsions in the two cases differ in any relevant respect. Nor\ndo the petitioners allege that the SEIU is crossing the line\nAbood drew by using their payments for political or ideo-\nlogical activities. The only point in dispute is whether it\nmatters that the personal assistants here are employees\nnot only of the State but also of the disabled persons for\nwhom they care. Just as the Court of Appeals held, that\n4                         HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nfact should make no difference to the analysis. See 656\nF. 3d 692, 698 (CA7 2011).\n   To see how easily Abood resolves this case, consider how\nIllinois structured the petitioners’ employment, and also\nwhy it did so. The petitioners work in Illinois’s Medicaid-\nfunded Rehabilitation Program, which provides in-home\nservices to persons with disabilities who otherwise would\nface institutionalization. Under the program, each disa-\nbled person (the State calls them “customers”) receives\ncare from a personal assistant; the total workforce exceeds\n20,000. The State could have asserted comprehensive\ncontrol over all the caregivers’ activities. But because of\nthe personalized nature of the services provided, Illinois\ninstead chose (as other States have as well) to share au-\nthority with the customers themselves. The result is that\neach caregiver has joint employers—the State and the\ncustomer—with each controlling significant aspects of the\nassistant’s work.1\n   For its part, Illinois sets all the workforce-wide terms of\nemployment. Most notably, the State determines and\npays the employees’ wages and benefits, including health\ninsurance (while also withholding taxes). See 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code §§686.10(h)(10), 686.40(a)–(b) (2007); App. 44–\n46. By regulation, Illinois establishes the job’s basic quali-\nfications: for example, the assistant must provide refer-\nences or recommendations and have adequate experience\nand training for the services given. See §§686.10(c), (f).\nSo too, the State describes the services any personal assis-\n——————\n    1 The\n        majority describes the petitioners as “partial” or “quasi” public\nemployees, a label of its own devising. Ante, at 28. But employment\nlaw has a real name—joint employees—for workers subject at once to\nthe authority of two or more employers (a not uncommon phenomenon).\nSee, e.g., 29 CFR §791.2 (2013); Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 376 U. S.\n473, 475 (1964). And the Department of Labor recently explained that\nin-home care programs, if structured like Illinois’s, establish joint\nemployment relationships. See 78 Fed. Reg. 60483–60484 (2013).\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

See §§686.10(h), 686.20.\n   Illinois as well structures the individual relationship\nbetween the customer and his assistant (in ways the\nmajority barely acknowledges). Along with both the cus-\ntomer and his physician, a state-employed counselor de-\nvelops a service plan laying out the assistant’s specific\njob responsibilities, hours, and working conditions. See\n§§684.10, 684.50. That counselor also assists the customer\nin conducting a state-mandated annual performance\nreview, based on state-established criteria, and mediates\nany resulting disagreements. See §686.30.\n   Within the structure designed by the State, the cus-\ntomer of course has crucial responsibilities. He exercises\nday-to-day supervisory control over the personal assistant.\nSee §676.30(b). And he gets both to hire a particular\ncaregiver (from among the pool of applicants Illinois has\ndeemed qualified) and to impose any needed discipline, up\nto and including discharge. See ibid.; §677.40(d). But\neven as to those matters, the State plays a role. Before a\ncustomer may hire an assistant, the counselor must sign\noff on the employee’s ability to follow the customer’s direc-\ntions and communicate with him. See §§686.10(d)–(e)\n(requiring that the employee demonstrate these capabili-\nties “to the satisfaction of” the counselor). And although\nonly a customer can actually fire an assistant, the State\ncan effectively do so by refusing to pay one who fails to\n“meet [state] standards.” §677.40(d). The majority reads\nthat language narrowly, see ante, at 3, n. 1, 22, but the\nState does not: It has made clear not just in its litigation\npapers, but also in its collective bargaining agreements\nand customer guidance that it will withhold payment from\nan assistant (or altogether disqualify her from the pro-\ngram) based on credible allegations of customer abuse,\nneglect, or financial exploitation. See App. 55; Brief for\n6                        HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nRespondent Quinn 3, 50; Ill.

In particular, if an assis-\ntant wants an increase in pay, she must ask the State, not\nthe individual customer. So too if she wants better bene-\nfits. (Although the majority notes that caregivers do not\nreceive statutory retirement and health insurance bene-\nfits, see ante, at 22, that is irrelevant: Collective bargain-\ning between the State and SEIU has focused on benefits\nfrom the beginning, and has produced state-funded health\ninsurance for personal assistants.) And because it is\nIllinois that would sit down at a bargaining table to ad-\ndress those subjects—the ones that matter most to em-\nployees and so most affect workforce stability—the State’s\nstake in a fair-share provision is the same as in Abood.\nHere too, the State has an interest in promoting effective\noperations by negotiating with an equitably and ade-\nquately funded exclusive bargaining agent over terms\nand conditions of employment. That Illinois has delegated\nto program customers various individualized employment\nissues makes no difference to those state interests. If\nanything, as the State has contended, the dispersion of\nemployees across numerous workplaces and the absence of\n——————\n   2 Indeed, pursuant to the grievance procedure in the present collec-\n\ntive bargaining agreement, the SEIU obtained an arbitration award\nreversing the State’s decision to disqualify an assistant from the\nprogram for such reasons.

App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 46a (Exec. Order No. 2003–8).\n   Indeed, the history of that program forcefully demon-\nstrates Illinois’s interest in bargaining with an adequately\nfunded exclusive bargaining agent—that is, the interest\nAbood recognized and protected. Workforce shortages and\nhigh turnover have long plagued in-home care programs,\nprincipally because of low wages and benefits. That labor\ninstability lessens the quality of care, which in turn, forces\ndisabled persons into institutions and (massively) in-\ncreases costs to the State. See Brief for Paraprofessional\nHealthcare Institute as Amicus Curiae 16–26; Brief for\nState of California et al. as Amici Curiae 4–5. The indi-\nvidual customers are powerless to address those systemic\nissues; rather, the State—because of its control over work-\nforce-wide terms of employment—is the single employer\nthat can do so. And here Illinois determined (as have nine\nother States, see Brief for Respondent SEIU 51, n. 14) that\nnegotiations with an exclusive representative offered the\nbest chance to set the Rehabilitation Program on firmer\nfooting. Because of that bargaining, as the majority\nacknowledges, home-care assistants have nearly doubled\ntheir wages in less than 10 years, obtained state-funded\nhealth insurance, and benefited from better training and\nworkplace safety measures. See ante, at 32–33; Brief for\nRespondent Quinn 7; App. 44–48. The State, in return,\nhas obtained guarantees against strikes or other work\nstoppages, see id., at 55—and most important, believes it\nhas gotten a more stable workforce providing higher qual-\nity care, thereby avoiding the costs associated with institu-\ntionalization. Illinois’s experience thus might serve as a\n8                        HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                        KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nveritable poster child for Abood—not, as the majority\nwould have it, some strange extension of that decision.\n  It is not altogether easy to understand why the majority\nthinks what it thinks: Today’s opinion takes the tack of\nthrowing everything against the wall in the hope that\nsomething might stick. A vain hope, as it turns out. Even\nonce disentangled, the various strands of the majority’s\nreasoning do not distinguish this case from Abood.\n  Parts of the majority’s analysis appear to rest on the\nsimple presence of another employer, possessing signifi-\ncant responsibilities, in addition to the State. See ante, at\n20–22, 24. But this Court’s cases provide no warrant for\nholding that joint public employees are not real ones. To\nthe contrary, the Court has made clear that the govern-\nment’s wide latitude to manage its workforce extends to\nsuch employees, even as against their First Amendment\nclaims. The government’s prerogative as employer, we\nrecently explained, turns not on the “formal status” of an\nemployee, but on the nature of the public “interests at\nstake”; we therefore rejected the view that “the Govern-\nment’s broad authority in managing its affairs should\napply with diminished force” to contract employees whose\n“direct employment relationship” is with another party.\nNASA v. Nelson, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 14–\n15). And indeed, we reached the same result (in language\nthat might have been written for this case) when such\nemployees “d[id] not work at the government’s work-\nplace[,] d[id] not interact daily with government officers\nand employees,” and were not subject to the government’s\n“day-to-day control” over “the details of how work is done.”\nBoard of Comm’rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.

Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, §2405/3(f) (West 2012);\nsee ante, at 6, 22–23; but cf. Martin v. Illinois, 2005 WL\n2267733, *5–*8 (Ill. Workers’ Compensation Comm’n, July\n26, 2005) (treating caregivers as public employees for\npurposes of workers’ compensation).5 But once again, it is\nhard to see why that fact is relevant. The majority must\nagree (this Court has made the point often enough) that\n——————\nclaims that joint or contract employees made against the government.\nThe only difference is that those suits challenged different restrictions\non the employees’ expressive activities.\n  4 In a related argument, the majority frets that if Abood extends to\n\nthe joint employees here, a “host of workers who receive payments from\na governmental entity for some sort of service would be candidates for\ninclusion within Abood’s reach.” Ante, at 28. But as I have just shown,\nthis Court has not allowed such worries about line-drawing to limit the\ngovernment’s authority over joint and contract employees in the past.\nAnd rightly so, because whatever close cases may arise at the margin\n(there always are some), the essential distinction between such employ-\nees and mere recipients of government funding is not hard to maintain.\nConsider again the combination of things Illinois does here: set wages,\nprovide benefits, administer payroll, withhold taxes, set minimum\nqualifications, specify terms of standard contracts, develop individual-\nized service plans, fund orientation and training, facilitate annual\nreviews, and resolve certain grievances. That combination of functions\nplaces the petitioners so securely on one side of the boundary between\npublic employees and mere recipients of public funding as to justify\ndeferral of line-drawing angst to another case.\n  5 As the opinion’s quadruple repetition of the words “appear” and\n\n“apparently” suggests, ante, at 22–23, the majority is mostly guessing\nas to in-home caregivers’ eligibility for various state programs.\n10                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n“state law labels,” adopted for a whole host of reasons, do\nnot determine whether the State is acting as an employer\nfor purposes of the First Amendment. E.g., Umbehr, 518\nU. S., at 679. The true issue is whether Illinois has a\nsufficient stake in, and control over, the petitioners’ terms\nand conditions of employment to implicate Abood’s ration-\nales and trigger its application. And once more, that\nquestion has a clear answer: As I have shown, Illinois\nnegotiates all workforce-wide terms of the caregivers’\nemployment as part of its effort to promote labor stability\nand effectively administer its Rehabilitation Program. See\nsupra, at 6–8. As contrasted to that all-important fact,\nwhether Illinois incurs vicarious liability for caregivers’\ntorts, see ante, at 23, or grants them certain statutory\nbenefits like health insurance, see ante, at 22, is beside the\npoint. And still more so because the State and SEIU can\nbargain over most such matters; for example, as I have\nnoted, the two have reached agreement on providing state-\nfunded health coverage, see supra, at 7.\n  Further, the majority claims, “the scope of bargaining”\nthat the SEIU may conduct for caregivers is “circum-\nscribed” because the customer has authority over individ-\nualized employment matters like hiring and firing. Ante,\nat 23–25. But (at the risk of sounding like a broken rec-\nord) so what? Most States limit the scope of permissible\nbargaining in the public sector—often ruling out of bounds\nsimilar, individualized decisions. See R. Kearney & P.\nMareschal, Labor Relations in the Public Sector 75–77\n(5th ed. 2014) (“The great majority of state statutes” ex-\nclude “certain matters from the scope of negotiations,”\nincluding, for example, personnel decisions respecting\n“hiring, promotion, and dismissal”); Note, Developments in\nthe Law—Public Employment, 97 Harv.

Those are the mat-\nters, after all, most likely to concern employees generally\nand thus most likely to affect the nature and quality of the\nState’s workforce. The idea that Abood applies only if a\nunion can bargain with the State over every issue comes\nfrom nowhere and relates to nothing in that decision—and\nwould revolutionize public labor law.\n   Finally, the majority places weight on an idiosyncrasy of\nIllinois law: that a regulation requires uniform wages for\nall personal assistants. See ante, at 25. According to the\nmajority, that means Abood’s free-rider rationale “has\nlittle force in the situation now before us”: Even absent the\nduty of fair representation (requiring the union to work on\nbehalf of all employees, members and non-members alike,\nsee infra, at 22–23), the union could not bargain one em-\nployee’s wages against another’s. Ante, at 26.6 But that\nidea is doubly wrong. First, the Illinois regulation applies\nonly to wages. It does not cover, for example, the signifi-\ncant health benefits that the SEIU has obtained for in-\nhome caregivers, or any other benefits for which it may\nbargain in the future. Nor does the regulation prevent\npreferential participation in the grievance process, which\ngoverns all disputes between Illinois and caregivers aris-\ning from the terms of their agreement. See n. 2, supra.\nAnd second, even if the regulation covered everything\nsubject to collective bargaining, the majority’s reasoning is\na non-sequitur. All the regulation would do then is serve\nas suspenders to the duty of fair representation’s belt:\nThat Illinois has two ways to ensure that the results of\n——————\n   6 The majority also suggests in this part of its opinion that even if the\n\nunion had latitude to demand higher wages only for its own supporters,\nit would not do so. See ante, at 27, n. 18. But why not? A rational\nunion, in the absence of any legal obligation to the contrary, would\nalmost surely take that approach to bargaining.\n12                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ncollective bargaining redound to the benefit of all employ-\nees serves to compound, rather than mitigate, the union’s\nfree-rider problem.\n   As far as I can tell, that covers the majority’s reasons for\ndistinguishing this case from Abood. And even when\nconsidered in combination, as the majority does, they do\nnot succeed. What makes matters still worse is the per-\nverse result of the majority’s decision: It penalizes the\nState for giving disabled persons some control over their\nown care. If Illinois had structured the program, as it\ncould have, to centralize every aspect of the employment\nrelationship, no question could possibly have arisen about\nAbood’s application. Nothing should change because the\nState chose to respect the dignity and independence of\nprogram beneficiaries by allowing them to select and\ndischarge, as well as supervise day-to-day, their own\ncaregivers. A joint employer remains an employer, and\nhere, as I have noted, Illinois kept authority over all work-\nforce-wide terms of employment—the very issues most\nlikely to be the subject of collective bargaining. The State\nthus should also retain the prerogative—as part of its\neffort to “ensure efficient and effective delivery of personal\ncare services”—to require all employees to contribute\nfairly to their bargaining agent. App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a\n(Exec. Order No. 2003–8).\n                             II\n   Perhaps recognizing the difficulty of plausibly distin-\nguishing this case from Abood, the petitioners raised a\nmore fundamental question: the continued viability of\nAbood as to all public employees, even what the majority\ncalls “full-fledged” ones. Ante, at 9. That issue occupied\nthe brunt of the briefing and argument in this Court. See,\ne.g., Brief for Petitioners 16–24; Brief for Respondent\nSEIU 15–44; Brief for Respondent Quinn 15–29; Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 14–28; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n21, 32–39, 42–47, 50–60. The majority declines the peti-\ntioners’ request to overturn precedent—and rightly so:\nThis Court does not have anything close to the special\njustification necessary to overturn Abood. Still, the major-\nity cannot restrain itself from providing a critique of that\ndecision, suggesting that it might have resolved the case\ndifferently in the first instance. That dicta is off-base:\nAbood corresponds precisely to this Court’s overall frame-\nwork for assessing public employees’ First Amendment\nclaims. To accept that framework, while holding Abood at\narms-length, is to wish for a sui generis rule, lacking in\njustification, applying exclusively to union fees.\n                              A\n   This Court’s view of stare decisis makes plain why the\nmajority cannot—and did not—overturn Abood. That\ndoctrine, we have stated, is a “foundation stone of the rule\nof law.” Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 15). It “promotes the\nevenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of\nlegal principles [and] fosters reliance on judicial deci-\nsions.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991). As\nimportant, it “contributes to the actual and perceived\nintegrity of the judicial process,” ibid., by ensuring that\ndecisions are “founded in the law rather than in the pro-\nclivities of individuals,” Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254,\n265 (1986). For all those reasons, this Court has always\nheld that “any departure” from precedent “demands spe-\ncial justification.” Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212\n(1984).\n   And Abood is not just any precedent: It is entrenched in\na way not many decisions are. Over nearly four decades,\nwe have cited Abood favorably numerous times, and we\nhave repeatedly affirmed and applied its core distinction\nbetween the costs of collective bargaining (which the\ngovernment can demand its employees share) and those of\n14                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\npolitical activities (which it cannot). See, e.g., Locke v.\nKarass, 555 U. S. 207, 213–214 (2009); Lehnert v. Ferris\nFaculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 519 (1991); Teachers v. Hud-\nson, 475 U. S. 292, 301–302 (1986); Ellis v. Railway\nClerks, 466 U. S. 435, 455–457 (1984). Reviewing those\ndecisions, this Court recently—and unanimously—called\nthe Abood rule “a general First Amendment principle.”\nLocke, 555 U. S., 213–215. And indeed, the Court has\nrelied on that rule in deciding cases involving compulsory\nfees outside the labor context—which today’s majority\nreaffirms as good law, see ante, at 37–39. See, e.g., Keller\nv. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 9–17 (1990) (state bar\nfees); Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. South-\nworth, 529 U. S. 217, 230–232 (2000) (public university\nstudent fees); Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott,\nInc., 521 U. S. 457, 471–473 (1997) (commercial advertis-\ning assessments). Not until two years ago, in Knox v.\nService Employees, 567 U. S. ___ (2012), did the Court so\nmuch as whisper (there without the benefit of briefing or\nargument, see id., at ___ (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in\njudgment) (slip op., at 1–6)) that it had any misgivings\nabout Abood.\n  Perhaps still more important, Abood has created enor-\nmous reliance interests. More than 20 States have enacted\nstatutes authorizing fair-share provisions, and on that\nbasis public entities of all stripes have entered into multi-\nyear contracts with unions containing such clauses. “Stare\ndecisis has added force,” we have held, when overturning a\nprecedent would require “States to reexamine [and amend]\ntheir statutes.” Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways\nComm’n, 502 U. S. 197, 202–203 (1991). And on top of\nthat, “[c]onsiderations in favor of stare decisis are at their\nacme in cases involving property and contract rights.”\nPayne, 501 U. S., at 828. Here, governments and unions\nacross the country have entered into thousands of con-\ntracts involving millions of employees in reliance on\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nAbood. Reliance interests do not come any stronger.\n   The majority’s criticisms of Abood do not remotely de-\nfeat those powerful reasons for adhering to the decision.\nThe special justifications needed to reverse an opinion\nmust go beyond demonstrations (much less assertions)\nthat it was wrong; that is the very point of stare decisis.\nAnd the majority’s critique extends no further. It is mostly\njust a catalog of errors Abood supposedly committed—\nreproaches that could have been leveled as easily 40 years\nago as today. Only the idea that Abood did not “antici-\npate” or “foresee” the difficulties of distinguishing between\ncollective bargaining and political activities, see ante, at\n18–19, might be thought different. But in fact, Abood\npredicted precisely those issues. See 431 U. S., at 236\n(“There will, of course, be difficult problems in drawing\nlines between collective-bargaining . . . and ideological\nactivities”). It simply disagreed with today’s majority\nabout whether in this context, as in many others, lines\nthat are less than pristine are still worth using. And in\nany event, the majority much overstates the difficulties of\nclassifying union expenditures. The Court’s most recent\ndecision on the subject unanimously resolved the single\nissue that had divided lower courts. See Locke, 555 U. S.,\nat 217–221. So it is not surprising that the majority fails\nto offer any concrete examples of thorny classification\nproblems. If the kind of hand-wringing about blurry lines\nthat the majority offers were enough to justify breaking\nwith precedent, we might have to discard whole volumes\nof the U. S. Reports.\n   And the majority says nothing to the contrary: It does\nnot pretend to have the requisite justifications to overrule\nAbood. Readers of today’s decision will know that Abood\ndoes not rank on the majority’s top-ten list of favorite\nprecedents—and that the majority could not restrain itself\nfrom saying (and saying and saying) so. Yet they will also\nknow that the majority could not, even after receiving full-\n16                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ndress briefing and argument, come up with reasons any-\nwhere near sufficient to reverse the decision. Much has\ngone wrong in today’s ruling, but this has not: Save for an\nunfortunate hiving off of ostensibly “partial-public” em-\nployees, ante, at 28, Abood remains the law.\n                              B\n    And even apart from stare decisis, that result is as it\nshould be; indeed, it is the only outcome that makes sense\nin the context of our caselaw. In numerous cases decided\nover many decades, this Court has addressed the govern-\nment’s authority to adopt measures limiting expression in\nthe capacity not of sovereign but of employer. Abood fits—\nfits hand-in-glove—with all those cases, in both reasoning\nand result. Were that rule not in place, our law respecting\npublic employees’ speech rights would contain a serious\nanomaly—a different legal standard (and not a good one)\napplying exclusively to union fees.\n    This Court has long acknowledged that the government\nhas wider constitutional latitude when it is acting as\nemployer than as sovereign. See Engquist v. Oregon Dept.\nof Agriculture, 553 U. S. 591, 598 (2008) (“[T]here is a\ncrucial difference, with respect to constitutional analysis,\nbetween the government exercising the power to regulate\n. . . and the government acting . . . to manage [its] internal\noperation” (internal quotation marks omitted)). “Time and\nagain our cases have recognized that the Government has\na much freer hand” in dealing with its employees than\nwith other citizens. NASA, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n12). We have explained that “[t]he government’s interest\nin achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as pos-\nsible is elevated” in the public workplace—that the gov-\nernment must have the ability to decide how to manage its\nemployees in order to best provide services to the public.\nEngquist, 553 U. S., at 598. In effect, we have tried to\nplace the government-qua-employer in a similar (though\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nnot identical) position to the private employer, recognizing\nthat both face comparable challenges in maintaining a\nproductive workforce. The result is that a public employee\n“must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom.”\nGarcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 418 (2006).\n“[A]lthough government employees do not lose their con-\nstitutional rights when they accept their positions, those\nrights must be balanced against the realities of the em-\nployment context.” Engquist, 553 U. S., at 600.\n   Further, this Court has developed and applied those\nprinciples in numerous cases involving First Amendment\nclaims. “Government employers, like private employers,”\nwe have explained, “need a significant degree of control\nover their employees’ words” in order to “efficient[ly]\nprovi[de] public services.” Garcetti, 547 U. S., at 418.\nAccordingly, we have devised methods for distinguishing\nbetween speech restrictions reflecting the kind of concerns\nprivate employers often hold (which are constitutional)\nand those exploiting the employment relationship to re-\nstrict employees’ speech as private citizens (which are\nnot). Most notably, the Court uses a two-step test origi-\nnating in Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High\nSchool Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563 (1968). First, if\nthe expression at issue does not relate to “a matter of\npublic concern,” the employee “has no First Amendment\ncause of action.” Garcetti, 547 U. S., at 418. Second, even\nif the speech addresses a matter of public concern, a court\nis to determine whether the government “had an adequate\njustification” for its action, ibid., by balancing “the inter-\nests of the [employee] as a citizen . . . and the interest of\nthe State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of\nthe public services it performs through its employees,”\nPickering, 391 U. S., at 568.\n   Abood is of a piece with all those decisions; and indeed,\nits core analysis mirrors Pickering’s. The Abood Court\nrecognized that fair-share provisions function as prerequi-\n18                    HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nsites to employment, assessed to cover the costs of repre-\nsenting employees in collective bargaining. Private em-\nployers, Abood noted, often established such employment\nconditions, to ensure adequate funding of an exclusive\nbargaining agent, and thus to promote labor stability.\nAbood acknowledged (contrary to the majority’s statement,\nsee ante, at 17) certain “differences in the nature of collec-\ntive bargaining in the public and private sectors.” 431\nU. S., at 227; see id., at 227–229. But the Court concluded\nthat the government, acting as employer, should have the\nsame prerogative as a private business in deciding how\nbest to negotiate with its employees over such matters as\nwages and benefits. See id., at 229 (“[T]here can be no\nprincipled basis for” distinguishing between a public and\nprivate employer’s view that a fair-share clause will pro-\nmote “labor stability”). At the same time, the Court rec-\nognized the need for some mechanism to ensure that the\ngovernment could not leverage its power as employer to\nimpinge on speech its employees undertook as citizens on\nmatters of public import. See id., at 234–236.\n   The Court struck the appropriate balance by drawing a\nline, corresponding to Pickering’s, between fees for collec-\ntive bargaining and those for political activities. On the\none side, Abood decided, speech within the employment\nrelationship about pay and working conditions pertains\nmostly to private concerns and implicates the govern-\nment’s interests as employer; thus, the government could\ncompel fair-share fees for collective bargaining. On the\nother side, speech in political campaigns relates to matters\nof public concern and has no bearing on the government’s\ninterest in structuring its workforce; thus, compelled fees\nfor those activities are forbidden. In that way, the law\nsurrounding fair-share provisions coheres with the law\nrelating to public employees’ speech generally. Or, said\notherwise, an anomaly in the government’s regulation of\nits workforce would arise in Abood’s absence: Public em-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nployers could then pursue all policies, except this single\none, reasonably designed to manage personnel and en-\nhance the effectiveness of their programs.\n   The majority’s critique of Abood principally goes astray\nby deeming all this irrelevant. This Court, the majority\ninsists, has never “seen Abood as based on Pickering\nbalancing.” Ante, at 34. But to rely on Abood’s failure to\ncite Pickering more often, as the majority does, see ante, at\n34, n. 26, is to miss the essential point. Although stem-\nming from different historic antecedents, the two decisions\naddressed variants of the same issue: the extent of the\ngovernment’s power to adopt employment conditions\naffecting expression. And as just discussed, the two\ngave strikingly parallel answers, providing a coherent\nframework to adjudicate the constitutionality of those\nregulations.\n   To the extent the majority engages with that frame-\nwork, its analysis founders at the first step, in assessing\nthe First Amendment value of the speech at issue here. A\nrunning motif of the majority opinion is that collective\nbargaining in the public sector raises significant questions\nabout the level of government spending. Ante, at 17–18\nand n. 7, 36 and nn. 28–29. By financing the SEIU’s\ncollective bargaining over wages and benefits, the majority\nsuggests, in-home caregivers—whether they wish to or\nnot—take one side in a debate about those issues.\n   But that view of the First Amendment interests at stake\nblinks decades’ worth of this Court’s precedent. Our deci-\nsions (tracing from Pickering as well as Abood) teach that\ninternal workplace speech about public employees’ wages,\nbenefits, and such—that is, the prosaic stuff of collective\nbargaining—does not become speech of “public concern”\njust because those employment terms may have broader\nconsequence. To the contrary, we have made clear that\nexcept in narrow circumstances we will not allow an em-\nployee to make a “federal constitutional issue” out of basic\n20                   HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n“employment matters, including working conditions, pay,\ndiscipline, promotions, leave, vacations, and termina-\ntions.” Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 10); see Umbehr, 518 U. S., at 675\n(public employees’ “speech on merely private employment\nmatters is unprotected”). Indeed, even Abood’s original\ndetractors conceded that an employee’s interest in ex-\npressing views, within the workplace context, about “nar-\nrowly defined economic issues [like] salaries and pension\nbenefits” is “relatively insignificant” and “weak.” 431\nU. S., at 263, n. 16 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).\n(Those Justices saved their fire for teachers’ speech relat-\ning to education policy. See ibid.) And nowhere has the\nCourt ever suggested, as the majority does today, see ante,\nat 35–36 and n. 28, that if a certain dollar amount is at\nstake (but how much, exactly?), the constitutional treat-\nment of an employee’s expression becomes any different.\n   Consider an analogy, not involving union fees: Suppose\nan employee violates a government employer’s work rules\nby demanding, at various inopportune times and places,\nhigher wages for both himself and his co-workers (which,\nof course, will drive up public spending). The government\nemployer disciplines the employee, and he brings a First\nAmendment claim. Would the Court consider his speech a\nmatter of public concern under Pickering? I cannot believe\nit would, and indeed the petitioners’ own counsel joins me\nin that view. He maintained at oral argument that such\nspeech would concern merely an “internal proprietary\nmatter,” thus allowing the employer to take disciplinary\naction. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 10. If the majority thinks oth-\nerwise, government entities across the country should\nprepare themselves for unprecedented limitations on their\nability to regulate their workforces. But again, I doubt\nthey need to worry, because this Court has never come\nclose to holding that any matter of public employment\naffecting public spending (which is to say most such mat-\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           21\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nters) becomes for that reason alone an issue of public\nconcern. (And on the off-chance that both the petitioners\nand I are wrong on that score, I am doubly confident that\nthe government would prevail under Pickering’s balancing\ntest.)\n   I can see no reason to treat the expressive interests of\nworkers objecting to payment of union fees, like the peti-\ntioners here, as worthy of greater consideration. The\nsubject matter of the speech is the same: wages and bene-\nfits for public employees. Or to put the point more fully:\nIn both cases (mine and the real one), the employer is\nsanctioning employees for choosing either to say or not to\nsay something respecting their terms and conditions of\nemployment. Of course, in my hypothetical, the employer\nis stopping the employee from speaking, whereas in this or\nany other case involving union fees, the employer is forc-\ning the employee to support such expression. But I am\nsure the majority would agree that that difference does\nnot make a difference—in other words, that the “difference\nbetween compelled speech and compelled silence” is “with-\nout constitutional significance.” Riley v. National Federa-\ntion of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 796 (1988).\nHence, in analyzing the kind of expression involved in this\ncase, Abood corresponds to Pickering (and vice versa)—\nwith each permitting a government to regulate such activ-\nity in aid of managing its workforce to provide public\nservices.\n   Perhaps, though, the majority’s skepticism about Abood\ncomes from a different source: its failure to fully grasp the\ngovernment’s interest in bargaining with an adequately\nfunded exclusive bargaining representative. One of the ma-\njority’s criticisms of Abood, stated still more prominently\nin Knox, 567 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10–11), goes some-\nthing as follows. Abood (so the majority says) wrongly saw\na government’s interest in bargaining with an exclusive\nrepresentative as “inextricably linked” with a fair-share\n22                   HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nagreement. Ante, at 31; see ante, at 20. A State, the\nmajority (a bit grudgingly) acknowledges, may well have\nreasons to bargain with a single agent for all employees;\nand without a fair-share agreement, that union’s activities\nwill benefit employees who do not pay dues. Yet “[s]uch\nfree-rider arguments,” the majority avers, “are generally\ninsufficient to overcome First Amendment objections.”\nAnte, at 8–9 (quoting Knox, 567 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n10–11)). In the majority’s words: “A host of organizations\nadvocate on behalf of the interests of persons falling\nwithin an occupational group, and many of these groups\nare quite successful even though they are dependent on\nvoluntary contributions.” Ante, at 33–34.\n   But Abood and a host of our other opinions have ex-\nplained and relied on an essential distinction between\nunions and special-interest organizations generally. See,\ne.g., Abood, 431 U. S., at 221–222 and n. 15; Communica-\ntions Workers v. Beck, 487 U. S. 735, 750 (1988); Machin-\nists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 762 (1961). The law compels\nunions to represent—and represent fairly—every worker\nin a bargaining unit, regardless whether they join or\ncontribute to the union. That creates a collective action\nproblem of far greater magnitude than in the typical\ninterest group, because the union cannot give any special\nadvantages to its own backers. In such a circumstance,\nnot just those who oppose but those who favor a union\nhave an economic incentive to withhold dues; only altru-\nism or loyalty—as against financial self-interest—can\nexplain their support. Hence arises the legal rule counte-\nnancing fair-share agreements: It ensures that a union\nwill receive adequate funding, notwithstanding its legally\nimposed disability—and so that a government wishing to\nbargain with an exclusive representative will have a via-\nble counterpart.\n   As is often the case, JUSTICE SCALIA put the point best:\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           23\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n    “Where the state imposes upon the union a duty to de-\n    liver services, it may permit the union to demand re-\n    imbursement for them; or, looked at from the other\n    end, where the state creates in the nonmembers a le-\n    gal entitlement from the union, it may compel them to\n    pay the cost. The ‘compelling state interest’ that justi-\n    fies this constitutional rule is not simply elimination\n    of the inequity arising from the fact that some union\n    activity redounds to the benefit of ‘free-riding’ non-\n    members; private speech often furthers the interests\n    of nonspeakers, and that does not alone empower the\n    state to compel the speech to be paid for. What is dis-\n    tinctive, however, about the ‘free riders’ [in unions]\n    . . . is that . . . the law requires the union to carry\n    [them]—indeed, requires the union to go out of its way\n    to benefit [them], even at the expense of its other in-\n    terests. . . . [T]he free ridership (if it were left to be\n    that) would be not incidental but calculated, not im-\n    posed by circumstances but mandated by government\n    decree.” Lehnert, 500 U. S., at 556 (opinion concur-\n    ring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\nAnd in other parts of its opinion, the majority itself mim-\nics the point, thus recognizing the core rationale of Abood:\nWhat justifies the agency fee, the majority notes, is “the\nfact that the State compels the union to promote and\nprotect the interests of nonmembers.” Ante, at 25; see\nante, at 27, n. 18. Exactly right; indeed, that is as clear a\none-sentence account of Abood’s free-rider rationale as\nappears in this Court’s decisions.\n   Still, the majority too quickly says, it has no worries in\nthis case: Given that Illinois’s caregivers voted to unionize,\n“it may be presumed that a high percentage of [them]\nbecame union members and are willingly paying union\ndues.” Ante, at 33. But in fact nothing of the sort may be\nso presumed, given that union supporters (no less than\n24                       HARRIS v. QUINN\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nunion detractors) have an economic incentive to free ride.\nSee supra, at 22–23. The federal workforce, on which the\nmajority relies, see ante, at 31, provides a case in point.\nThere many fewer employees pay dues than have voted for\na union to represent them.7 And why, after all, should\nthat endemic free-riding be surprising? Does the majority\nthink that public employees are immune from basic prin-\nciples of economics? If not, the majority can have no basis\nfor thinking that absent a fair-share clause, a union can\nattract sufficient dues to adequately support its functions.\n  This case in fact offers a prime illustration of how a fair-\nshare agreement may serve important government inter-\nests. Recall that Illinois decided that collective bargaining\nwith an exclusive representative of in-home caregivers\nwould enable it to provide improved services through its\nRehabilitation Program. See supra, at 7–8. The State\nthought such bargaining would enable it to attract a better\nand more stable workforce to serve disabled patients,\npreventing their institutionalization and thereby decreas-\ning total state expenditures. The majority does not deny\nthe State’s legitimate interest in choosing to negotiate\nwith an exclusive bargaining agent, in service of adminis-\ntering an effective program. See ante, at 32–33. But the\nmajority does deny Illinois the means it reasonably\ndeemed appropriate to effectuate that policy—a fair-share\nprovision ensuring that the union has the funds necessary\nto carry out its responsibilities on behalf of in-home care-\n\n——————\n  7 See, e.g., R.

Abood got this matter\nright; the majority gets it wrong: Illinois has a more than\nsufficient interest, in managing its workforce and admin-\nistering the Rehabilitation Program, to require employees\nto pay a fair share of a union’s costs of collective bargaining.\n                             III\n   For many decades, Americans have debated the pros\nand cons of right-to-work laws and fair-share require-\nments. All across the country and continuing to the pre-\nsent day, citizens have engaged in passionate argument\nabout the issue and have made disparate policy choices.\nThe petitioners in this case asked this Court to end that\ndiscussion for the entire public sector, by overruling Abood\nand thus imposing a right-to-work regime for all govern-\nment employees. The good news out of this case is clear:\nThe majority declined that radical request. The Court did\nnot, as the petitioners wanted, deprive every state and\nlocal government, in the management of their employees\nand programs, of the tool that many have thought neces-\nsary and appropriate to make collective bargaining work.\n   The bad news is just as simple: The majority robbed\nIllinois of that choice in administering its in-home care\nprogram. For some 40 years, Abood has struck a stable\nbalance—consistent with this Court’s general framework\nfor assessing public employees’ First Amendment claims—\nbetween those employees’ rights and government entities’\ninterests in managing their workforces. The majority\ntoday misapplies Abood, which properly should control\nthis case. Nothing separates, for purposes of that decision,\nIllinois’s personal assistants from any other public em-\nployees. The balance Abood struck thus should have\ndefeated the petitioners’ demand to invalidate Illinois’s\nfair-share agreement. I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2681318/", "sha1": "b31b5dcaa5c667638c1b135832d8bd35e50847c6", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-071", "time_retrieved": "2014-06-30T08:00:51.955033"}
