The court ex-\r\nplained that “ ‘an accusatory pleading charging a defend-\r\nant with murder need not specify the theory of murder on\r\nwhich the prosecution intends to rely,’ ” and noted that the\r\n“information charged defendant with murder in compli-\r\nance with the governing statutes.” Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"830529\"><a href=\"/mich/5fTt/people-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">4975500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6–*7. Furthermore, the court held that “even\r\nif this case required greater specificity concerning the\r\nbasis of defendant’s liability, the evidence presented at his\r\npreliminary examination provided it.” Id., at *7. The\r\nupshot was that “the information and preliminary exami-\r\nnation testimony adequately notified defendant he could\r\nbe prosecuted for murder as an aider and abettor.” Id., at\r\n*8. The California Supreme Court denied respondent’s\r\npetition for review.\r\n   Respondent filed a petition for habeas relief with the\r\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of\r\nCalifornia. The Magistrate Judge recommended granting\r\nrelief, and the District Court summarily adopted the\r\nMagistrate Judge’s recommendation.\r\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The court acknowledged\r\nthat the “information charging [respondent] with first-\r\ndegree murder was initially sufficient to put him on notice\r\nthat he could be convicted either as a principal or as an\r\naider-and-abettor,” because under California law “aiding\r\nand abetting a crime is the same substantive offense as\r\nperpetrating the crime.” 731 F. 3d, at 868. But the Ninth\r\nCircuit nevertheless concluded that respondent’s Sixth\r\nAmendment and due process right to notice had been\r\n4                     LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                         Per Curiam\r\n\r\nviolated because it believed the prosecution (until it re-\r\nquested the aiding-and-abetting jury instruction) had tried\r\nthe case only on the theory that respondent himself had\r\ndelivered the fatal blow. See id., at 869.\r\n  The Ninth Circuit did not purport to identify any case in\r\nwhich we have found notice constitutionally inadequate\r\nbecause, although the defendant was initially adequately\r\napprised of the offense against him, the prosecutor focused\r\nat trial on one potential theory of liability at the expense\r\nof another. Rather, it found the instant case to be “indis-\r\ntinguishable from” the Ninth Circuit’s own decision in\r\nSheppard v. Rees, 909 F. 2d 1234 (1989), which the court\r\nthought “faithfully applied the principles enunciated by\r\nthe Supreme Court.” 731 F. 3d, at 868. The court also\r\nrejected, as an “unreasonable determination of the facts,”\r\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2), the California Court of Appeal’s\r\nconclusion that preliminary examination testimony and\r\nthe jury instructions conference put respondent on notice\r\nof the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting\r\ntheory. See id., at 871–872.\r\n                             II\r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n  The Ninth Circuit held, and respondent does not dis-\r\npute, that respondent initially received adequate notice of\r\nthe possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting\r\ntheory. The question is therefore whether habeas relief is\r\nwarranted because the State principally relied at trial on\r\nthe theory that respondent himself delivered the fatal\r\nblow.\r\n  Assuming, arguendo, that a defendant is entitled to\r\nnotice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-\r\nabetting theory, the Ninth Circuit’s grant of habeas relief\r\nmay be affirmed only if this Court’s cases clearly establish\r\nthat a defendant, once adequately apprised of such a\r\npossibility, can nevertheless be deprived of adequate\r\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

The Ninth Circuit pointed to no\r\ncase of ours holding as much. Instead, the Court of Ap-\r\npeals cited three older cases that stand for nothing more\r\nthan the general proposition that a defendant must have\r\nadequate notice of the charges against him. See 731 F. 3d,\r\nat 866–867 (citing Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749,\r\n763–764 (1962); In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 273–274\r\n(1948); Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U. S. 196, 201 (1948)).\r\n   This proposition is far too abstract to establish clearly\r\nthe specific rule respondent needs. We have before cau-\r\ntioned the lower courts—and the Ninth Circuit in particu-\r\nlar—against “framing our precedents at such a high level\r\nof generality.” Nevada v. Jackson, 569 U. S. ___, ___\r\n(2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 7). None of our decisions\r\nthat the Ninth Circuit cited addresses, even remotely, the\r\nspecific question presented by this case. See Russell,\r\nsupra, at 752 (indictment for “refus[ing] to answer any\r\nquestion pertinent to [a] question under [congressional]\r\ninquiry,” 2 U. S. C. §192, failed to “identify the subject\r\nunder congressional subcommittee inquiry”); In re Oliver,\r\nsupra, at 259 (instantaneous indictment, conviction, and\r\nsentence by judge acting as grand jury with no prior notice\r\nof charge to defendant); Cole, supra, at 197 (affirmance of\r\ncriminal convictions “under a . . . statute for violation of\r\nwhich [defendants] had not been charged”).1\r\n   Because our case law does not clearly establish the legal\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   1 Respondent claims that our decision in Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U. S.\r\n\r\n110 (1991), although not cited by the Ninth Circuit, clearly establishes\r\nthe legal principle he needs. But Lankford is of no help to respondent.\r\nThat case addressed whether a defendant had adequate notice of the\r\npossibility of imposition of the death penalty—a far different question\r\nfrom whether respondent had adequate notice of the particular theory\r\nof liability. See id., at 111. In Lankford, moreover, the trial court itself\r\nmade specific statements that encouraged the defendant to believe that\r\nthe death penalty was off the table. See id., at 116–117.\r\n6                      LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                          Per Curiam\r\n\r\nproposition needed to grant respondent habeas relief, the\r\nNinth Circuit was forced to rely heavily on its own deci-\r\nsion in Sheppard, supra. Of course, AEDPA permits\r\nhabeas relief only if a state court’s decision is “contrary to,\r\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\r\nlished Federal law” as determined by this Court, not by\r\nthe courts of appeals. 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). The Ninth\r\nCircuit attempted to evade this barrier by holding that\r\nSheppard “faithfully applied the principles enunciated by\r\nthe Supreme Court in Cole, Oliver, and Russell.” 731\r\nF. 3d, at 868. But Circuit precedent cannot “refine or\r\nsharpen a general principle of Supreme Court jurispru-\r\ndence into a specific legal rule that this Court has not\r\nannounced.” Marshall, 569 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 6).\r\nSheppard is irrelevant to the question presented by this\r\ncase: whether our case law clearly establishes that a pros-\r\necutor’s focus on one theory of liability at trial can render\r\nearlier notice of another theory of liability inadequate.\r\n                             B\r\n  The Ninth Circuit also disagreed with what it termed\r\nthe state court’s “determination of the facts”—principally,\r\nthe state court’s holding that preliminary examination\r\ntestimony and the prosecutors’ request for an aiding-and-\r\nabetting jury instruction shortly before closing arguments\r\nadequately put respondent on notice of the prosecution’s\r\naiding-and-abetting theory. 731 F. 3d, at 871 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit therefore\r\ngranted relief under §2254(d)(2), which permits habeas\r\nrelief where the state-court “decision . . . was based on an\r\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\r\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.” That\r\nholding cannot be sustained.\r\n  In purporting to reject the state court’s “determination\r\nof the facts,” the Ninth Circuit focused on preliminary\r\nexamination testimony by an investigator about conversa-\r\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\r\n\r\n                           Per Curiam\r\n\r\ntions between respondent and his cellmate. According to\r\nthe investigator, the cellmate stated that respondent told\r\nhim that respondent “had to get rid of his wife because she\r\nwas standing in the way of his future plans; that she was\r\nthreatening to divorce him and he wasn’t going to give up\r\nhalf of his property”; that respondent made his house look\r\nlike the site of a home invasion robbery; and that, when he\r\nleft for work the morning of the murder, he left the win-\r\ndow open and did not set the alarm. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"830529\"><a href=\"/mich/5fTt/people-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">4975500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7. The investigator also testified that the\r\ncellmate did not “ ‘know any of the details of the homicide\r\nitself and how it was carried out,’ ” and that respondent\r\n“ ‘never told [the cellmate] specifically who’ ” committed the\r\nhomicide. Ibid. The California Court of Appeal held that\r\nthese statements, taken together, suggested that respond-\r\nent was involved in planning and facilitating the crime but\r\nthat the fatal blow might have been delivered by an ac-\r\ncomplice. Ibid. Thus, the California court believed that\r\neven assuming that the information by itself was not\r\nsufficient, this testimony naturally lent itself to conviction\r\non an aiding-and-abetting theory and so gave respondent\r\neven greater notice of such a possibility. Ibid.\r\n   The Ninth Circuit also focused on the jury instructions\r\nconference, which occurred after the defense rested but\r\nbefore the parties’ closing arguments. During that confer-\r\nence, prosecutors requested an aiding-and-abetting in-\r\nstruction, which further provided notice to respondent.\r\nThe California Court of Appeal concluded that this case is\r\ndistinguishable from Sheppard v. Rees, 909 F. 2d 1234,\r\nbecause, unlike that case, the conference here did not\r\noccur immediately before closing arguments. The Ninth\r\nCircuit disagreed, holding that because “defense counsel\r\nhad only the lunch recess to formulate a response” to the\r\naiding-and-abetting instruction, this case “is indistin-\r\nguishable from Sheppard,” where the prosecution also\r\n“requested the new instruction the same day as closing.”\r\n8                          LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                              Per Curiam\r\n\r\n731 F. 3d, at 868, 870.\r\n   Although the Ninth Circuit claimed its disagreement\r\nwith the state court was factual in nature, in reality its\r\ngrant of relief was based on a legal conclusion about the\r\nadequacy of the notice provided. The Ninth Circuit be-\r\nlieved that the events detailed above, even when taken\r\ntogether with the information filed against respondent,\r\nfailed to measure up to the standard of notice applicable in\r\ncases like this. That ranked as a legal determination\r\ngoverned by §2254(d)(1), not one of fact governed by\r\n§2254(d)(2). But, as we have explained, the Ninth Circuit\r\ncited only its own precedent for establishing the appropri-\r\nate standard. Absent a decision of ours clearly establish-\r\ning the relevant standard, the Ninth Circuit had nothing\r\nagainst which it could assess, and deem lacking, the notice\r\nafforded respondent by the information and proceedings.\r\nIt therefore had no basis to reject the state court’s assess-\r\nment that respondent was adequately apprised of the pos-\r\nsibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory.2\r\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The\r\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\r\nNinth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                                     It is so ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n    2 Because we reverse the Ninth Circuit’s decision on the foregoing\r\ngrounds, we need not opine on the correctness of that court’s discussion\r\nof Griffin v.

The court ex-\r\nplained that “ ‘an accusatory pleading charging a defend-\r\nant with murder need not specify the theory of murder on\r\nwhich the prosecution intends to rely,’ ” and noted that the\r\n“information charged defendant with murder in compli-\r\nance with the governing statutes.” Smith, 2010 WL\r\n4975500, at *6–*7. Furthermore, the court held that “even\r\nif this case required greater specificity concerning the\r\nbasis of defendant’s liability, the evidence presented at his\r\npreliminary examination provided it.” Id., at *7. The\r\nupshot was that “the information and preliminary exami-\r\nnation testimony adequately notified defendant he could\r\nbe prosecuted for murder as an aider and abettor.” Id., at\r\n*8. The California Supreme Court denied respondent’s\r\npetition for review.\r\n   Respondent filed a petition for habeas relief with the\r\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of\r\nCalifornia. The Magistrate Judge recommended granting\r\nrelief, and the District Court summarily adopted the\r\nMagistrate Judge’s recommendation.\r\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The court acknowledged\r\nthat the “information charging [respondent] with first-\r\ndegree murder was initially sufficient to put him on notice\r\nthat he could be convicted either as a principal or as an\r\naider-and-abettor,” because under California law “aiding\r\nand abetting a crime is the same substantive offense as\r\nperpetrating the crime.” 731 F. 3d, at 868. But the Ninth\r\nCircuit nevertheless concluded that respondent’s Sixth\r\nAmendment and due process right to notice had been\r\n4                     LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                         Per Curiam\r\n\r\nviolated because it believed the prosecution (until it re-\r\nquested the aiding-and-abetting jury instruction) had tried\r\nthe case only on the theory that respondent himself had\r\ndelivered the fatal blow. See id., at 869.\r\n  The Ninth Circuit did not purport to identify any case in\r\nwhich we have found notice constitutionally inadequate\r\nbecause, although the defendant was initially adequately\r\napprised of the offense against him, the prosecutor focused\r\nat trial on one potential theory of liability at the expense\r\nof another. Rather, it found the instant case to be “indis-\r\ntinguishable from” the Ninth Circuit’s own decision in\r\nSheppard v. Rees, 909 F. 2d 1234 (1989), which the court\r\nthought “faithfully applied the principles enunciated by\r\nthe Supreme Court.” 731 F. 3d, at 868. The court also\r\nrejected, as an “unreasonable determination of the facts,”\r\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2), the California Court of Appeal’s\r\nconclusion that preliminary examination testimony and\r\nthe jury instructions conference put respondent on notice\r\nof the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting\r\ntheory. See id., at 871–872.\r\n                             II\r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n  The Ninth Circuit held, and respondent does not dis-\r\npute, that respondent initially received adequate notice of\r\nthe possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting\r\ntheory. The question is therefore whether habeas relief is\r\nwarranted because the State principally relied at trial on\r\nthe theory that respondent himself delivered the fatal\r\nblow.\r\n  Assuming, arguendo, that a defendant is entitled to\r\nnotice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-\r\nabetting theory, the Ninth Circuit’s grant of habeas relief\r\nmay be affirmed only if this Court’s cases clearly establish\r\nthat a defendant, once adequately apprised of such a\r\npossibility, can nevertheless be deprived of adequate\r\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)                      5\r\n\r\n                               Per Curiam\r\n\r\nnotice by a prosecutorial decision to focus on another\r\ntheory of liability at trial. The Ninth Circuit pointed to no\r\ncase of ours holding as much. Instead, the Court of Ap-\r\npeals cited three older cases that stand for nothing more\r\nthan the general proposition that a defendant must have\r\nadequate notice of the charges against him. See 731 F. 3d,\r\nat 866–867 (citing Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749,\r\n763–764 (1962); In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 273–274\r\n(1948); Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U. S. 196, 201 (1948)).\r\n   This proposition is far too abstract to establish clearly\r\nthe specific rule respondent needs. We have before cau-\r\ntioned the lower courts—and the Ninth Circuit in particu-\r\nlar—against “framing our precedents at such a high level\r\nof generality.” Nevada v. Jackson, 569 U. S. ___, ___\r\n(2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 7). None of our decisions\r\nthat the Ninth Circuit cited addresses, even remotely, the\r\nspecific question presented by this case. See Russell,\r\nsupra, at 752 (indictment for “refus[ing] to answer any\r\nquestion pertinent to [a] question under [congressional]\r\ninquiry,” 2 U. S. C. §192, failed to “identify the subject\r\nunder congressional subcommittee inquiry”); In re Oliver,\r\nsupra, at 259 (instantaneous indictment, conviction, and\r\nsentence by judge acting as grand jury with no prior notice\r\nof charge to defendant); Cole, supra, at 197 (affirmance of\r\ncriminal convictions “under a . . . statute for violation of\r\nwhich [defendants] had not been charged”).1\r\n   Because our case law does not clearly establish the legal\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   1 Respondent claims that our decision in Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U. S.\r\n\r\n110 (1991), although not cited by the Ninth Circuit, clearly establishes\r\nthe legal principle he needs. But Lankford is of no help to respondent.\r\nThat case addressed whether a defendant had adequate notice of the\r\npossibility of imposition of the death penalty—a far different question\r\nfrom whether respondent had adequate notice of the particular theory\r\nof liability. See id., at 111. In Lankford, moreover, the trial court itself\r\nmade specific statements that encouraged the defendant to believe that\r\nthe death penalty was off the table. See id., at 116–117.\r\n6                      LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                          Per Curiam\r\n\r\nproposition needed to grant respondent habeas relief, the\r\nNinth Circuit was forced to rely heavily on its own deci-\r\nsion in Sheppard, supra. Of course, AEDPA permits\r\nhabeas relief only if a state court’s decision is “contrary to,\r\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\r\nlished Federal law” as determined by this Court, not by\r\nthe courts of appeals. 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). The Ninth\r\nCircuit attempted to evade this barrier by holding that\r\nSheppard “faithfully applied the principles enunciated by\r\nthe Supreme Court in Cole, Oliver, and Russell.” 731\r\nF. 3d, at 868. But Circuit precedent cannot “refine or\r\nsharpen a general principle of Supreme Court jurispru-\r\ndence into a specific legal rule that this Court has not\r\nannounced.” Marshall, 569 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 6).\r\nSheppard is irrelevant to the question presented by this\r\ncase: whether our case law clearly establishes that a pros-\r\necutor’s focus on one theory of liability at trial can render\r\nearlier notice of another theory of liability inadequate.\r\n                             B\r\n  The Ninth Circuit also disagreed with what it termed\r\nthe state court’s “determination of the facts”—principally,\r\nthe state court’s holding that preliminary examination\r\ntestimony and the prosecutors’ request for an aiding-and-\r\nabetting jury instruction shortly before closing arguments\r\nadequately put respondent on notice of the prosecution’s\r\naiding-and-abetting theory. 731 F. 3d, at 871 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit therefore\r\ngranted relief under §2254(d)(2), which permits habeas\r\nrelief where the state-court “decision . . . was based on an\r\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\r\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.” That\r\nholding cannot be sustained.\r\n  In purporting to reject the state court’s “determination\r\nof the facts,” the Ninth Circuit focused on preliminary\r\nexamination testimony by an investigator about conversa-\r\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\r\n\r\n                           Per Curiam\r\n\r\ntions between respondent and his cellmate. According to\r\nthe investigator, the cellmate stated that respondent told\r\nhim that respondent “had to get rid of his wife because she\r\nwas standing in the way of his future plans; that she was\r\nthreatening to divorce him and he wasn’t going to give up\r\nhalf of his property”; that respondent made his house look\r\nlike the site of a home invasion robbery; and that, when he\r\nleft for work the morning of the murder, he left the win-\r\ndow open and did not set the alarm. Smith, 2010 WL\r\n4975500, at *7. The investigator also testified that the\r\ncellmate did not “ ‘know any of the details of the homicide\r\nitself and how it was carried out,’ ” and that respondent\r\n“ ‘never told [the cellmate] specifically who’ ” committed the\r\nhomicide. Ibid. The California Court of Appeal held that\r\nthese statements, taken together, suggested that respond-\r\nent was involved in planning and facilitating the crime but\r\nthat the fatal blow might have been delivered by an ac-\r\ncomplice. Ibid. Thus, the California court believed that\r\neven assuming that the information by itself was not\r\nsufficient, this testimony naturally lent itself to conviction\r\non an aiding-and-abetting theory and so gave respondent\r\neven greater notice of such a possibility. Ibid.\r\n   The Ninth Circuit also focused on the jury instructions\r\nconference, which occurred after the defense rested but\r\nbefore the parties’ closing arguments. During that confer-\r\nence, prosecutors requested an aiding-and-abetting in-\r\nstruction, which further provided notice to respondent.\r\nThe California Court of Appeal concluded that this case is\r\ndistinguishable from Sheppard v. Rees, 909 F. 2d 1234,\r\nbecause, unlike that case, the conference here did not\r\noccur immediately before closing arguments. The Ninth\r\nCircuit disagreed, holding that because “defense counsel\r\nhad only the lunch recess to formulate a response” to the\r\naiding-and-abetting instruction, this case “is indistin-\r\nguishable from Sheppard,” where the prosecution also\r\n“requested the new instruction the same day as closing.”\r\n8                          LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                              Per Curiam\r\n\r\n731 F. 3d, at 868, 870.\r\n   Although the Ninth Circuit claimed its disagreement\r\nwith the state court was factual in nature, in reality its\r\ngrant of relief was based on a legal conclusion about the\r\nadequacy of the notice provided. The Ninth Circuit be-\r\nlieved that the events detailed above, even when taken\r\ntogether with the information filed against respondent,\r\nfailed to measure up to the standard of notice applicable in\r\ncases like this. That ranked as a legal determination\r\ngoverned by §2254(d)(1), not one of fact governed by\r\n§2254(d)(2). But, as we have explained, the Ninth Circuit\r\ncited only its own precedent for establishing the appropri-\r\nate standard. Absent a decision of ours clearly establish-\r\ning the relevant standard, the Ninth Circuit had nothing\r\nagainst which it could assess, and deem lacking, the notice\r\nafforded respondent by the information and proceedings.\r\nIt therefore had no basis to reject the state court’s assess-\r\nment that respondent was adequately apprised of the pos-\r\nsibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory.2\r\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The\r\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\r\nNinth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                                     It is so ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n    2 Because we reverse the Ninth Circuit’s decision on the foregoing\r\ngrounds, we need not opine on the correctness of that court’s discussion\r\nof Griffin v.
