Decided November 10, 2014 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, worked as police\nofficers for the city of Shelby, Mississippi. They allege\nthat they were fired by the city’s board of aldermen, not\nfor deficient performance, but because they brought to\nlight criminal activities of one of the aldermen. Charging\nviolations of their Fourteenth Amendment due process\nrights, they sought compensatory relief from the city.\nSummary judgment was entered against them in the\nDistrict Court, and affirmed on appeal, for failure to in-\nvoke 42 U. S. C. §1983 in their complaint.\n   We summarily reverse. Federal pleading rules call for\n“a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the\npleader is entitled to relief,” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2);\nthey do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for\nimperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the\nclaim asserted.

(Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n“are designed to discourage battles over mere form of\nstatement”); 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, §1215, p. 172 (3d ed.\n2002) (Rule 8(a)(2) “indicates that a basic objective of the\nrules is to avoid civil cases turning on technicalities”). In\nparticular, no heightened pleading rule requires plaintiffs\nseeking damages for violations of constitutional rights to\ninvoke §1983 expressly in order to state a claim. See\nLeatherman v.

S. 622, 638 (1980) (a\n“municipality may not assert the good faith of its officers\nor agents as a defense to liability under §1983”).\n   Our decisions in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550\nU. S. 544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662\n(2009), are not in point, for they concern the factual alle-\ngations a complaint must contain to survive a motion to\ndismiss. A plaintiff, they instruct, must plead facts suffi-\ncient to show that her claim has substantive plausibility.\nPetitioners’ complaint was not deficient in that regard.\nPetitioners stated simply, concisely, and directly events\nthat, they alleged, entitled them to damages from the city.\nHaving informed the city of the factual basis for their\ncomplaint, they were required to do no more to stave off\nthreshold dismissal for want of an adequate statement\nof their claim.
