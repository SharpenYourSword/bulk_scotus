In the main, Frost drove his\nconfederates to and from their crimes. On one occasion, he\nalso entered the house being robbed. On another, he\nperformed surveillance in anticipation of the robbery.\n   Washington charged Frost with robbery and related\noffenses. Taking the witness stand, Frost admitted to his\ninvolvement, but claimed he acted under duress. As clos-\ning arguments drew near, however, Frost’s lawyer ex-\npressed the desire to contend both (1) that the State failed\nto meet its burden of proving that Frost was an accomplice\nto the crimes and (2) that Frost acted under duress. The\ntrial judge insisted that the defense choose between these\nalternative arguments, explaining that state law prohib-\nited a defendant from simultaneously contesting the ele-\nments of the crime and presenting the affirmative defense\nof duress. So Frost’s lawyer limited his summation to\nduress. The jury convicted Frost of six counts of robbery,\none count of attempted robbery, one count of burglary, and\ntwo counts of assault.\n   The Washington Supreme Court sustained Frost’s con-\nviction. It rejected the trial court’s view that state law\nprohibited Frost from simultaneously contesting criminal\nliability and arguing duress. State v.

FROST\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\npreventing the defense from presenting both theories\nduring summation, it said, the trial court violated the\nNational Constitution’s Due Process and Assistance of\nCounsel Clauses. Id., at 777–779, 161 P. 3d, at 368–369.\nBut the State Supreme Court continued, this improper\nrestriction of closing argument qualified as a trial error (a\nmistake reviewable for harmlessness) rather than a struc-\ntural error (a mistake that requires automatic reversal).\nId., at 779–782, 161 P. 3d, at 369–370. Because the jury\nheard three taped confessions and Frost’s admission of\nguilt on the witness stand, and because it received proper\ninstructions on the State’s burden of proof, the State\nSupreme Court held that any error was harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Id., at 782–783, 161 P. 3d, at 370–371.\n  Frost filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28\nU. S. C. §2254. The District Court dismissed the petition,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 76a, and a panel of the Court of\nAppeals affirmed, Frost v. Van Boening, 692 F. 3d 924\n(CA9 2012). But the Court of Appeals en banc reversed\nand instructed the District Court to grant relief. 757 F. 3d\n910 (2014).\n  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), the Court of Appeals had power to\ngrant Frost habeas corpus only if the Washington Su-\npreme Court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates,” or “was based on an unreasonable determination\nof the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State\ncourt proceeding.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d). Here, the Ninth\nCircuit held that the Washington Supreme Court unrea-\nsonably applied clearly established federal law by failing\nto classify the trial court’s restriction of closing argument\nas structural error.\n  That decision cannot stand.

Only the\nrare type of error—in general, one that “ ‘infect[s] the\nentire trial process’ ” and “ ‘necessarily render[s] [it] fun-\ndamentally unfair’ ”—requires automatic reversal. Ibid.\nNone of our cases clearly requires placing improper re-\nstriction of closing argument in this narrow category.\n   The Ninth Circuit claimed that the Washington Su-\npreme Court contradicted Herring v. New York, 422 U. S.\n853 (1975). Herring held that complete denial of summa-\ntion violates the Assistance of Counsel Clause. According\nto the Ninth Circuit, Herring further held that this denial\namounts to structural error. We need not opine on the\naccuracy of that interpretation. For even assuming that\nHerring established that complete denial of summation\namounts to structural error, it did not clearly establish\nthat the restriction of summation also amounts to struc-\ntural error. A court could reasonably conclude, after all,\nthat prohibiting all argument differs from prohibiting\nargument in the alternative. That is all the more true\nbecause our structural-error cases “ha[ve] not been char-\nacterized by [an] ‘in for a penny, in for a pound’ approach.”\nNeder, supra, at 17, n. 2.\n   Attempting to bridge the gap between Herring and this\ncase, the Ninth Circuit cited two Circuit precedents—\nUnited States v. Miguel, 338 F. 3d 995 (CA9 2003), and\nConde v. Henry, 198 F. 3d 734 (CA9 2000)—for the propo-\nsition that “preventing a defendant from arguing a legiti-\nmate defense theory constitutes structural error.” 757\nF. 3d, at 916. As we have repeatedly emphasized, how-\never, circuit precedent does not constitute “clearly estab-\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.”\n§2254(d)(1); see, e.g., Lopez v.

But\nneither Miguel nor Conde arose under AEDPA, so neither\npurports to reflect the law clearly established by this\nCourt’s holdings. The Ninth Circuit thus had no justifica-\ntion for relying on those decisions. See Parker v. Mat-\nthews, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 13).\n   The second rationale for the Court of Appeals’ decision\nis no more sound than the first. The Ninth Circuit rea-\nsoned that, by allowing the prosecution to argue that it\nhad proved the elements of the crimes, but “prohibit[ing]”\nthe defense from responding that it had not, the trial court\nin effect “forc[ed] defense counsel to concede his client’s\nguilt.” 757 F. 3d, at 917. By extracting this “conce[ssion],”\nthe Ninth Circuit continued, the trial court “relieved the\nState of its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt,” “shifted the burden of proof to Frost,” and even\n“directed [a] verdict on guilt”—all “unquestionably struc-\ntural [errors].” Id., at 917–918.\n   No. The trial court, to begin, did not prohibit the de-\nfense from arguing that the prosecution failed to prove the\nelements of the crime. It instead precluded the defense\nfrom simultaneously contesting reasonable doubt and\nclaiming duress. Reasonable minds could disagree whether\nrequiring the defense to choose between alternative theo-\nries amounts to requiring the defense to concede guilt.\nStill more could they disagree whether it amounts to\neliminating the prosecution’s burden of proof, shifting the\nburden to the defendant, or directing a verdict. In addi-\ntion, even if the trial court’s ruling somehow “forced” the\ndefense “at least tacitly [to] admit the elements of the\ncrimes,” id., at 913, the Ninth Circuit still would have no\nbasis for ruling as it did.
