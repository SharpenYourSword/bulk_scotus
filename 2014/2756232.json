S. ____ (2014)            1\n\n                    Statement of KAGAN, J.\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n      PATRICK HENRY JOSEPH, PETITIONER v. \n\n                UNITED STATES\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n  STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 13–10639.   Decided December 1, 2014\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. JUSTICE\nKENNEDY and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would grant the peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari.\n   Statement of JUSTICE KAGAN, with whom JUSTICE\nGINSBURG and JUSTICE BREYER join, respecting the denial\nof certiorari.\n   The courts of appeals have wide discretion to adopt and\napply “procedural rules governing the management of\nlitigation.” Thomas v. Arn, 474 U. S. 140, 146 (1985). But\nthat discretion is not unlimited. Procedural rules of\ncourse must yield to constitutional and statutory require-\nments. Id., at 148. And more to the point here, those\nrules, along with their application to particular cases,\nmust “represent reasoned exercises of the courts’ author-\nity.” Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507 U. S. 234, 244\n(1993). That is not a high bar, but it is an important one.\n   Petitioner Patrick Joseph asks us to review the Elev-\nenth Circuit’s application of a rule providing that issues\nnot raised in an opening appellate brief are forfeited, and\nso may not be raised in subsequent filings. See Order in\nNo. 12–16167 (July 8, 2013), App. 6 to Pet. for Cert. (citing\nUnited States v. Hembree, 381 F. 3d 1109 (CA11 2004)).\nIn the usual case, that rule (which all the federal courts of\nappeals employ) makes excellent sense: It ensures that\nopposing parties will have notice of every issue in an\nappeal, and that neither they nor reviewing courts will\nincur needless costs from eleventh-hour changes of course.\n   But this is not the usual case. Joseph took an appeal to\n2                JOSEPH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Statement of KAGAN, J.\n\nthe Eleventh Circuit after he was convicted of several drug\noffenses and sentenced as a career offender under the\nSentencing Guidelines. At the time Joseph filed his open-\ning brief, Eleventh Circuit precedent precluded the argu-\nment that he did not properly qualify as a career offender.\nSee United States v. Rainer, 616 F. 3d 1212, 1215–1216\n(2010). Soon after his filing, however, this Court decided\nDescamps v. United States, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), which\nmade clear that the relevant Circuit precedent was “no\nlonger good law,” United States v. Howard, 742 F. 3d 1334,\n1345 (2014). Five days later (which was still nine days\nbefore the Government’s brief came due), Joseph moved to\nfile a replacement brief relying on Descamps to challenge\nhis classification as a career offender. (He acknowledged\nthat because he had failed to raise the Descamps claim at\ntrial, it would be reviewable for plain error.) The Gov-\nernment did not oppose the motion, asking only for addi-\ntional time to file its own brief. The Eleventh Circuit\nnonetheless refused to accept Joseph’s filing.\n   Not a single other court of appeals would have done\nthat. See United States v. Vanorden, 414 F. 3d 1321, 1324\n(CA11 2005) (Tjoflat, J., specially concurring) (noting that\nthe Eleventh Circuit’s rule is “inconsistent with . . . the\nlaw of every other circuit”). Every circuit, save the Elev-\nenth, accepts supplemental or substitute briefs as a mat-\nter of course when this Court issues a decision that upsets\nprecedent relevant to a pending case and thereby provides\nan appellant with a new theory or claim. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Anderson, 745 F. 3d 593, 594, 598 (CA1 2014)\n(Descamps claim); United States v. Clark, 28 Fed. Appx.\n34, 35 (CA2 2001); United States v. Blair, 734 F. 3d 218,\n223 (CA3 2013) (Descamps claim); United States v. Mus-\nleh, 106 Fed. Appx. 850, 857, n. 4 (CA4 2004); United\nStates v. Delgado, 256 F. 3d 264, 280 (CA5 2001); United\nStates v. Mitchell, 743 F. 3d 1054, 1063 (CA6 2014)\n(Descamps claim); United States v. Askew, 403 F. 3d 496,\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                     Statement of KAGAN, J.\n\n509 (CA7 2005); United States v. Bankhead, 746 F. 3d 323,\n325 (CA8 2014) (Descamps claim); United States v. Cabrera-\nGuiterrez, 756 F. 3d 1125, 1127 (CA9 2013) (Descamps\nclaim); United States v. Clifton, 406 F. 3d 1173, 1175, n. 1\n(CA10 2005); United States v. Coumaris, 399 F. 3d 343,\n347 (CADC 2005). Indeed, each considers such briefs even\nwhen submitted later in the appellate process than Joseph\ntried to file his. See, e.g., Cabrera-Guiterrez, 756 F. 3d, at\n1127 (after argument); Blair, 734 F. 3d, at 223 (after full\nbriefing). And as the above citations show, the circuit\ncourts—once again, bar the Eleventh—have routinely\nfollowed that practice in the wake of Descamps.\n    There is good reason for this near-unanimity. When a\nnew claim is based on an intervening Supreme Court\ndecision—as Joseph’s is on Descamps—the failure to raise\nthe claim in an opening brief reflects not a lack of dili-\ngence, but merely a want of clairvoyance. Relying on that\nmisprediction alone to deny relief to an appellant like\nJoseph while granting it to the defendant in Descamps ill-\nfits with the principle, animating our criminal retroactiv-\nity law, of “treating similarly situated defendants the\nsame.” Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 323, 328 (1987)\n(holding that new rules “appl[y] retroactively to all cases\n. . . pending on direct review”). And indeed, insisting on\npreservation of claims in this context forces every appel-\nlant to raise “claims that are squarely foreclosed by circuit\nand [even] Supreme Court precedent on the off chance\nthat [a new] decision will make them suddenly viable.”\nVanorden, 414 F. 3d, at 1324 (Tjoflat, J., specially concur-\nring). That is an odd result for a procedural rule designed\nin part to promote judicial economy.\n    Perhaps for such reasons, even the Eleventh Circuit\ndoes not apply its default rule consistently when this\nCourt hands down a new decision. Sometimes, as here,\nthe court views its rule as pertaining “uniformly and\nequally to all cases,” so that a panel becomes simply “un-\n4                 JOSEPH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Statement of KAGAN, J.\n\nable to entertain” any claim not raised in an initial brief.\nUnited States v. Bordon, 421 F. 3d 1202, 1206, n. 1 (2005).\nBut other times, the court abandons the rule without\nexplanation—including, at least twice, for Descamps\nclaims. See, e.g., United States v. Ramirez-Flores, 743\nF. 3d 816, 820 (2014) (addressing a Descamps claim raised\n“for the first time at oral argument”); United States v.\nEstrella, 758 F. 3d 1239 (2014) (addressing a Descamps\nclaim raised first in a Rule 28(j) letter after all briefs were\nfiled); United States v. Levy, 379 F. 3d 1241, 1244–1245\n(2004) (per curiam) (acknowledging “a few decisions where\nthis Court apparently considered a new issue raised in a\nsupplemental brief ”). Thus, criminal defendants with\nunpreserved new claims may be treated differently within\nthe Eleventh Circuit, just as they are as between the\nEleventh Circuit and every other court of appeals.\n   I nonetheless agree with the Court’s decision today to\ndeny certiorari. We do not often review the circuit courts’\nprocedural rules. And we usually allow the courts of\nappeals to clean up intra-circuit divisions on their own, in\npart because their doing so may eliminate any conflict\nwith other courts of appeals. For those combined reasons,\nI favor deferring, for now, to the Eleventh Circuit, in the\nhope that it will reconsider whether its current practice\namounts to a “reasoned exercise[ ]” of its authority.
