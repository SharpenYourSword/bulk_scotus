Argued October 15, 2014—Decided January 20, 2015\nPetitioners, Teva Pharmaceuticals (and related firms), own a patent\n  that covers a manufacturing method for the multiple sclerosis drug\n  Copaxone. When respondents, Sandoz, Inc. (and other firms), tried to\n  market a generic version of the drug, Teva sued them for patent in­\n  fringement. Sandoz countered that the patent was invalid. Specifi­\n  cally, Sandoz argued that the claim that Copaxone’s active ingredient\n  had “a molecular weight of 5 to 9 kilodaltons” was fatally indefinite,\n  see 35 U. S. C. §112 ¶2, because it did not state which of three meth­\n  ods of calculation—the weight of the most prevalent molecule, the\n  weight as calculated by the average weight of all molecules, or weight\n  as calculated by an average in which heavier molecules count for\n  more—was used to determine that weight. After considering conflict­\n  ing expert evidence, the District Court concluded that the patent\n  claim was sufficiently definite and the patent was thus valid. As rel­\n  evant here, it found that in context a skilled artisan would under­\n  stand that the term “molecular weight” referred to molecular weight\n  as calculated by the first method. In finding the “molecular weight”\n  term indefinite and the patent invalid on appeal, the Federal Circuit\n  reviewed de novo all aspects of the District Court’s claim construc­\n  tion, including the District Court’s determination of subsidiary facts.\nHeld: When reviewing a district court’s resolution of subsidiary factual\n matters made in the course of its construction of a patent claim, the\n Federal Circuit must apply a “clear error,” not a de novo, standard of\n review. Pp. 4–16.\n    (a) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6) states that a court of\n appeals “must not . . . set aside” a district court’s “[f]indings of fact”\n unless they are “clearly erroneous.” It sets out a “clear command,”\n2       TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574, and “does not make\n    exceptions or . . . exclude certain categories of factual findings” from\n    the court of appeals’ obligation, Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456\n    U. S. 273, 287. The Rule thus applies to both subsidiary and ulti­\n    mate facts. Ibid. And the function of an appeals court reviewing the\n    findings of a “ ‘district court sitting without a jury . . . is not to decide\n    factual issues de novo.’ ” Anderson, supra, at 573. Even if exceptions\n    to the Rule were permissible, there is no convincing ground for creat­\n    ing an exception here. Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517\n    U. S. 370, neither created, nor argued for, such an exception. There,\n    the Court held that the ultimate question of claim construction is for\n    the judge, not the jury, id., at 372, but it did not thereby create an ex­\n    ception from the ordinary rule governing appellate review of factual\n    matters. Instead, the Court pointed out that a judge, in construing a\n    patent claim, is engaged in much the same task as the judge would\n    be in construing other written instruments, such as deeds, contracts,\n    or tariffs. Id., at 384, 386, 388, 389. Construction of written instru­\n    ments often presents a “question solely of law,” at least when the\n    words in those instruments are “used in their ordinary meaning.”\n    Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., 259 U. S. 285, 291.\n    But if a written instrument uses “technical words or phrases not\n    commonly understood,” id., at 292, those words may give rise to a fac­\n    tual dispute. If so, extrinsic evidence may help to “establish a usage\n    of trade or locality.” Ibid. And in that circumstance, the “determina­\n    tion of the matter of fact” will “preced[e]” the “function of construc­\n    tion.” Ibid.\n       The Markman Court also recognized that courts will sometimes\n    have to resolve subsidiary factual disputes in patent construction;\n    Rule 52 requires appellate courts to review such disputes under the\n    “clearly erroneous” standard. Application of this standard is further\n    supported by precedent and by practical considerations. Clear error\n    review is “particularly” important in patent cases because a district\n    court judge who has presided over, and listened to, the entire pro­\n    ceeding has a comparatively greater opportunity to gain the neces­\n    sary “familiarity with specific scientific problems and principles,”\n    Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U. S. 605,\n    610, than an appeals court judge who must read a written transcript\n    or perhaps just those portions referenced by the parties. Pp. 4–8.\n       (b) Arguments to the contrary are unavailing. Sandoz claims that\n    separating “factual” from “legal” questions may be difficult and, like\n    the Federal Circuit, posits that it is simpler for the appellate court to\n    review the entirety of the district court’s claim construction de novo\n    than to apply two separate standards. But courts of appeals have\n    long been able to separate factual from legal matters, see, e.g., First\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 947–948, and the\n  Federal Circuit’s efforts to treat factual findings and legal conclu­\n  sions similarly have brought with them their own complexities. As\n  for Sandoz’s argument that “clear error” review will bring about less\n  uniformity, neither the Circuit nor Sandoz has shown that divergent\n  claim construction stemming from divergent findings of fact on sub­\n  sidiary matters should occur more than occasionally. Pp. 8–11.\n     (c) This leaves the question of how the clear error standard should\n  be applied when reviewing subsidiary factfinding in patent claim\n  construction. When the district court reviews only evidence intrinsic\n  to the patent, the judge’s determination is solely a determination of\n  law, and the court of appeals will review that construction de novo.\n  However, where the district court needs to consult extrinsic evidence\n  in order to understand, for example, the background science or the\n  meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time peri­\n  od, and where those subsidiary facts are in dispute, courts will need\n  to make subsidiary factual findings about the extrinsic evidence. The\n  district judge, after deciding the factual dispute, will then interpret\n  the patent claim in light of the facts as he has found them. The ulti­\n  mate construction of the claim is a legal conclusion that the appellate\n  court can review de novo. But to overturn the judge’s resolution of an\n  underlying factual dispute, the appellate court must find that the\n  judge, in respect to those factual findings, has made a clear error.\n  Pp. 11–14.\n     (d) Here, for example, the District Court made a factual finding,\n  crediting Teva’s expert’s account, and thereby rejecting Sandoz’s ex­\n  pert’s contrary explanation, about how a skilled artisan would under­\n  stand the way in which a curve created from chromatogram data re­\n  flects molecular weights. Based on that factual finding, the District\n  Court reached the legal conclusion that figure 1 did not undermine\n  Teva’s argument that molecular weight referred to the first method of\n  calculating molecular weight. When the Federal Circuit reviewed the\n  District Court’s decision, it did not accept Teva’s expert’s explanation,\n  and it failed to accept that explanation without finding that the Dis­\n  trict Court’s contrary determination was “clearly erroneous.” The\n  Federal Circuit erred in failing to review this factual finding only for\n  clear error. Teva asserts that there are two additional instances in\n  which the Federal Circuit rejected the District Court’s factual find­\n  ings without concluding that they were clearly erroneous; those mat­\n  ters are left for the Federal Circuit to consider on remand.

Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S.\n370 (1996), we explained that a patent claim is that “por­\ntion of the patent document that defines the scope of the\npatentee’s rights.” Id., at 372. We held that “the con­\nstruction of a patent, including terms of art within its\nclaim,” is not for a jury but “exclusively” for “the court” to\ndetermine. Ibid. That is so even where the construction\nof a term of art has “evidentiary underpinnings.” Id., at\n390.\n   Today’s case involves claim construction with “eviden­\ntiary underpinnings.” See Part III, infra. And, it requires\nus to determine what standard the Court of Appeals\nshould use when it reviews a trial judge’s resolution of an\nunderlying factual dispute. Should the Court of Appeals\nreview the district court’s factfinding de novo as it would\nreview a question of law? Or, should it review that fact-\nfinding as it would review a trial judge’s factfinding in\nother cases, namely by taking them as correct “unless\nclearly erroneous?” See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6). We\nhold that the appellate court must apply a “clear error,”\n2    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot a de novo, standard of review.\n                                I\n   The basic dispute in this case concerns the meaning of\nthe words “molecular weight” as those words appear in a\npatent claim. The petitioners, Teva Pharmaceuticals\n(along with related firms), own the relevant patent. The\npatent covers a manufacturing method for Copaxone, a\ndrug used to treat multiple sclerosis. The drug’s active\ningredient, called “copolymer-1,” is made up of molecules\nof varying sizes. App. 1143a. And the relevant claim\ndescribes that ingredient as having “a molecular weight of\n5 to 9 kilodaltons.” Id., at 1145a.\n   The respondents, Sandoz, Inc. (and several other firms),\ntried to market a generic version of Copaxone. Teva sued\nSandoz for patent infringement. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 581\n(SDNY 2011). Sandoz defended the suit by arguing that\nthe patent was invalid. Ibid. The Patent Act requires\nthat a claim “particularly poin[t] out and distinctly clai[m]\nthe subject matter which the applicant regards as his\ninvention.” 35 U. S. C. §112 ¶2 (2006 ed.); see Nautilus,\nInc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1\n(2014) (slip op., at 3, n. 1)). The phrase “molecular weight\nof 5 to 9 kilodaltons,” said Sandoz, did not satisfy this\nrequirement.\n   The reason that the phrase is fatally indefinite, Sandoz\nargued, is that, in the context of this patent claim, the\nterm “molecular weight” might mean any one of three\ndifferent things. The phrase might refer (1) to molecular\nweight as calculated by the weight of the molecule that is\nmost prevalent in the mix that makes up copolymer-1.\n(The scientific term for molecular weight so calculated is,\nwe are told, “peak average molecular weight.”) The phrase\nmight refer (2) to molecular weight as calculated by taking\nall the different-sized molecules in the mix that makes up\ncopolymer-1 and calculating the average weight, i.e.,\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nadding up the weight of each molecule and dividing by the\nnumber of molecules. (The scientific term for molecular\nweight so calculated is, we are told, “number average\nmolecular weight.”) Or, the phrase might refer (3) to\nmolecular weight as calculated by taking all the different-\nsized molecules in the mix that makes up copolymer-1 and\ncalculating their average weight while giving heavier\nmolecules a weight-related bonus when doing so. (The\nscientific term for molecular weight so calculated, we are\ntold, is “weight average molecular weight.”) See 723 F. 3d\n1363, 1367 (CA Fed. 2013); App. 124a. In Sandoz’s view,\nsince Teva’s patent claim does not say which method of\ncalculation should be used, the claim’s phrase “molecular\nweight” is indefinite, and the claim fails to satisfy the\ncritical patent law requirement.\n   The District Court, after taking evidence from experts,\nconcluded that the patent claim was sufficiently definite.\nAmong other things, it found that in context a skilled\nartisan would understand that the term “molecular\nweight” referred to molecular weight as calculated by the\nfirst method, i.e., “peak average molecular weight.” 810\nF. Supp. 2d, at 596; see Nautilus, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n12) (“[T]he definiteness inquiry trains on the understand­\ning of a skilled artisan at the time of the patent applica­\ntion”). In part for this reason, the District Court held the\npatent valid. 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 596.\n   On appeal, the Federal Circuit held to the contrary. It\nfound that the term “molecular weight” was indefinite.\nAnd it consequently held the patent invalid. 723 F. 3d, at\n1369. In reaching this conclusion, the Federal Circuit\nreviewed de novo all aspects of the District Court’s claim\nconstruction, including the District Court’s determination\nof subsidiary facts. Id., at 1369, 1373; see also Light-\ning Ballast Control LLC v. Philips Electronics North\nAm. Corp., 744 F. 3d 1272, 1276–1277 (CA Fed. 2014) (en\nbanc) (reaffirming de novo review of district court claim\n4    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconstruction).\n   Teva filed a petition for certiorari. And we granted that\npetition. The Federal Circuit reviews the claim construc­\ntion decisions of federal district courts throughout the\nNation, and we consequently believe it important to clarify\nthe standard of review that it must apply when doing so.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6) states that a\ncourt of appeals “must not . . . set aside” a district court’s\n“[f ]indings of fact” unless they are “clearly erroneous.” In\nour view, this rule and the standard it sets forth must\napply when a court of appeals reviews a district court’s\nresolution of subsidiary factual matters made in the\ncourse of its construction of a patent claim. We have made\nclear that the Rule sets forth a “clear command.” Ander-\nson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574 (1985). “It does\nnot make exceptions or purport to exclude certain catego­\nries of factual findings from the obligation of a court of\nappeals to accept a district court’s findings unless clearly\nerroneous.” Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S. 273,\n287 (1982). Accordingly, the Rule applies to both subsidi­\nary and ultimate facts. Ibid. And we have said that,\nwhen reviewing the findings of a “ ‘district court sitting\nwithout a jury, appellate courts must constantly have in\nmind that their function is not to decide factual issues\nde novo.’ ” Anderson, supra, at 573 (quoting Zenith Radio\nCorp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U. S. 100, 123\n(1969)).\n   Even if exceptions to the Rule were permissible, we\ncannot find any convincing ground for creating an excep­\ntion to that Rule here. The Rules Advisory Committee\npointed out that, in general, exceptions “would tend to\nundermine the legitimacy of the district courts . . . , multi­\nply appeals . . . , and needlessly reallocate judicial author­\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nity.” Advisory Committee’s 1985 Note on subd. (a) of Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 52, 28 U. S. C. App., pp. 908–909; see also\nAnderson, supra, at 574–575 (de novo review of fac-\ntual findings “would very likely contribute only negligibly”\nto accuracy “at a huge cost in diversion of judicial\nresources”).\n   Our opinion in Markman neither created, nor argued\nfor, an exception to Rule 52(a). The question presented in\nthat case was a Seventh Amendment question: Should a\njury or a judge construe patent claims? 517 U. S., at 372.\nWe pointed out that history provides no clear answer. Id.,\nat 388. The task primarily involves the construction of\nwritten instruments. Id., at 386, 388, 389. And that task\nis better matched to a judge’s skills. Id., at 388 (“The\nconstruction of written instruments is one of those things\nthat judges often do and are likely to do better than jurors\nunburdened by training in exegesis”). We consequently\nheld that claim construction falls “exclusively within the\nprovince of the court,” not that of the jury. Id., at 372.\n   When describing claim construction we concluded that it\nwas proper to treat the ultimate question of the proper\nconstruction of the patent as a question of law in the way\nthat we treat document construction as a question of law.\nId., at 388–391. But this does not imply an exception to\nRule 52(a) for underlying factual disputes. We used the\nterm “question of law” while pointing out that a judge, in\nconstruing a patent claim, is engaged in much the same\ntask as the judge would be in construing other written\ninstruments, such as deeds, contracts, or tariffs. Id., at\n384, 386, 388, 389; see also Motion Picture Patents Co. v.\nUniversal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502, 510 (1917) (patent\nclaims are “aptly likened to the description in a deed,\nwhich sets the bounds to the grant which it contains”);\nGoodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. v. Davis, 102 U. S. 222, 227\n(1880) (analogizing patent construction to the construction\nof other written instruments like contracts). Construction\n6    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof written instruments often presents a “question solely of\nlaw,” at least when the words in those instruments are\n“used in their ordinary meaning.” Great Northern R. Co.\nv. Merchants Elevator Co., 259 U. S. 285, 291 (1922). But\nsometimes, say when a written instrument uses “technical\nwords or phrases not commonly understood,” id., at 292,\nthose words may give rise to a factual dispute. If so, ex­\ntrinsic evidence may help to “establish a usage of trade or\nlocality.” Ibid. And in that circumstance, the “determina­\ntion of the matter of fact” will “preced[e]” the “function of\nconstruction.” Ibid.; see also 12 R. Lord, Williston on\nContracts §§34:1, p. 2, 34:19, p. 174 (4th ed. 2012) (In\ncontract interpretation, the existence of a “usage”—a\n“practice or method” in the relevant industry—“is a ques­\ntion of fact” (internal quotation marks omitted)). This\nfactual determination, like all other factual determina­\ntions, must be reviewed for clear error. See Pullman-\nStandard, supra at 287 (The Rule does not “exclude cer­\ntain categories of factual findings” and applies to both\n“subsidiary” and “ultimate” facts (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   Accordingly, when we held in Markman that the ulti­\nmate question of claim construction is for the judge and\nnot the jury, we did not create an exception from the ordi­\nnary rule governing appellate review of factual matters.\nMarkman no more creates an exception to Rule 52(a) than\nwould a holding that judges, not juries, determine equit­\nable claims, such as requests for injunctions. A conclusion\nthat an issue is for the judge does not indicate that Rule\n52(a) is inapplicable. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52 (setting\nthe standard of review for “[Factual] Findings and Conclu­\nsions by the Court” (emphasis added)).\n   While we held in Markman that the ultimate issue of\nthe proper construction of a claim should be treated as a\nquestion of law, we also recognized that in patent con­\nstruction, subsidiary factfinding is sometimes necessary.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nIndeed, we referred to claim construction as a practice\nwith “evidentiary underpinnings,” a practice that “falls\nsomewhere between a pristine legal standard and a simple\nhistorical fact.” 517 U. S., at 378, 388, 390. We added\nthat sometimes courts may have to make “credibility\njudgments” about witnesses. Id., at 389. In other words,\nwe recognized that courts may have to resolve subsidiary\nfactual disputes. And, as explained above, the Rule re­\nquires appellate courts to review all such subsidiary fac­\ntual findings under the “clearly erroneous” standard.\n   Precedent further supports application of the “clearly\nerroneous” standard. Before the creation of the Federal\nCircuit, the Second Circuit explained that in claim con­\nstruction, the subsidiary “question . . . of how the art un-\nderstood the term . . . was plainly a question of fact; and\nunless the [district court’s] finding was ‘clearly erroneous,’\nwe are to take” it “as controlling.” Harries v. Air King\nProducts, Co., 183 F. 2d 158, 164 (CA2 1950) (L. Hand,\nC. J.). We have said the same as to subsidiary factual\nfindings concerning other patent law inquiries, including\n“obviousness.” Dennison Mfg. Co. v. Panduit Corp., 475\nU. S. 809, 811 (1986) (per curiam) (“subsidiary determina­\ntions of the District Court” subject to Rule 52(a)’s clear\nerror standard).\n   Finally, practical considerations favor clear error re­\nview. We have previously pointed out that clear error\nreview is “particularly” important where patent law is at\nissue because patent law is “a field where so much de­\npends upon familiarity with specific scientific problems\nand principles not usually contained in the general store­\nhouse of knowledge and experience.” Graver Tank & Mfg.\nCo. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U. S. 605, 610 (1950). A\ndistrict court judge who has presided over, and listened to,\nthe entirety of a proceeding has a comparatively greater\nopportunity to gain that familiarity than an appeals court\njudge who must read a written transcript or perhaps just\n8    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthose portions to which the parties have referred. Cf.\nLighting Ballast, 744 F. 3d, at 1311 (O’Malley, J., dissent­\ning) (Federal Circuit judges “lack the tools that district\ncourts have available to resolve factual disputes fairly and\naccurately,” such as questioning the experts, examining\nthe invention in operation, or appointing a court-appointed\nexpert); Anderson, 470 U. S., at 574 (“The trial judge’s\nmajor role is the determination of fact, and with experi­\nence in fulfilling that role comes expertise”).\n                              B\n   Sandoz argues that claim construction mostly consists of\nconstruing a set of written documents that do not give rise\nto subsidiary factual disputes. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39. It adds\nthat separating “factual” from “legal” questions is often\ndifficult. And Sandoz, like the Federal Circuit itself,\nargues that it is simpler for that appellate court to review\nthe entirety of the district court’s claim construction de\nnovo rather than to apply two separate standards. Id., at\n38; see also Lighting Ballast, supra, at 1284 (criticizing\nclear error review in part because of the purportedly diffi­\ncult task of “disentangling” fact from law).\n   But even were we free to ignore the Federal Rule (which\nwe are not), we would not find this argument convincing.\nCourts of appeals have long found it possible to separate\nfactual from legal matters. See, e.g., First Options of\nChicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 947–948 (1995)\n(review of factual findings for clear error and legal conclu­\nsions de novo is the “ordinary” standard for courts of ap­\npeals). At the same time, the Federal Circuit’s efforts to\ntreat factual findings and legal conclusions similarly have\nbrought with them their own complexities. See e.g., Cybor\nCorp. v. FAS Technologies, Inc., 138 F. 3d 1448, 1454 (CA\nFed. 1998) (en banc) (claim construction does not involve\n“factual evidentiary findings” (citation and internal quota­\ntion marks omitted)); Lighting Ballast, supra, at 1284\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Menell et al. as\nAmici Curiae 5 (Federal Circuit overturns district court\nclaim construction at unusually high rate).\n   Finally, the Circuit feared that “clear error” review\nwould bring about less uniformity. Lighting Ballast,\nsupra, at 1280. Neither the Circuit nor Sandoz, however,\nhas shown that (or explained why) divergent claim con­\nstruction stemming from divergent findings of fact (on\nsubsidiary matters) should occur more than occasionally.\nAfter all, the Federal Circuit will continue to review de\nnovo the district court’s ultimate interpretation of the\npatent claims. And the attorneys will no doubt bring cases\nconstruing the same claim to the attention of the trial\njudge; those prior cases will sometimes be binding because\nof issue preclusion, see Markman, 517 U. S., at 391, and\nsometimes will serve as persuasive authority. Moreover,\n10   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nit is always possible to consolidate for discovery different\ncases that involve construction of the same claims. And,\nas we said in Markman, subsidiary factfinding is unlikely\nto loom large in the universe of litigated claim construc­\ntion. Id., at 389–390.\n                             C\n  The dissent argues that claim construction does not\ninvolve any “factfinding,” or, if it does, claim construction\nfactfinding is akin to the factfinding that underlies our\ninterpretation of statutes. Post, at 1, 5–7 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.). Its first, broader contention runs contrary to\nour recognition in Markman that claim construction has\n“evidentiary underpinnings” and that courts construing\npatent claims must sometimes make “credibility judg­\nments” about witnesses. 517 U. S., at 389–390. Indeed, as\ndiscussed in Part III, infra, this case provides a perfect\nexample of the factfinding that sometimes underlies claim\nconstruction: The parties here presented the District\nCourt with competing fact-related claims by different\nexperts, and the District Court resolved the issues of fact\nthat divided those experts.\n  The dissent’s contention also runs contrary to Sandoz’s\nconcession at oral argument that claim construction will\nsometimes require subsidiary factfinding. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n33–34, 38–40. It is in tension with our interpretation of\nrelated areas of patent law, such as the interpretation of\n“obviousness,” which we have said involves subsidiary\nfactfinding subject to Rule 52(a)’s clear error review. See\nDennison, 475 U. S., at 811. And it fights the question\npresented in this case, which assumes the existence of\nsuch factfinding. See Pet. for Cert. i (whether “a district\ncourt’s factual finding in support of its construction of a\npatent claim term may be reviewed de novo, . . . or only\nfor clear error”).\n  Neither do we find factfinding in this context sufficiently\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsimilar to the factfinding that underlies statutory inter­\npretation. Statutes, in general, address themselves to the\ngeneral public; patent claims concern a small portion of\nthat public. Statutes typically (though not always) rest\nupon congressional consideration of general facts related\nto a reasonably broad set of social circumstances; patents\ntypically (though not always) rest upon consideration by a\nfew private parties, experts, and administrators of more\nnarrowly circumscribed facts related to specific technical\nmatters. The public, and often an adversarial public,\ntypically considers and discusses the relevant general\nfacts before Congress enacts a statute; only private par­\nties, experts, and administrators likely consider the rele­\nvant technical facts before the award of a patent. Given\nthese differences, it is not surprising that this Court has\nnever previously compared patent claim construction in\nany here relevant way to statutory construction. As dis­\ncussed supra, at 5, however, the Court has repeatedly\ncompared patent claim construction to the construction of\nother written instruments such as deeds and contracts.\nSee, e.g., Markman, supra, at 384, 386, 388, 389; Motion\nPicture Patent Co., 243 U. S., at 510; Goodyear, 102 U. S.,\nat 227.\n                             D\n  Now that we have set forth why the Federal Circuit\nmust apply clear error review when reviewing subsidiary\nfactfinding in patent claim construction, it is necessary to\nexplain how the rule must be applied in that context. We\nrecognize that a district court’s construction of a patent\nclaim, like a district court’s interpretation of a written\ninstrument, often requires the judge only to examine and\nto construe the document’s words without requiring the\njudge to resolve any underlying factual disputes. As all\nparties agree, when the district court reviews only evi­\ndence intrinsic to the patent (the patent claims and speci­\n12   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfications, along with the patent’s prosecution history), the\njudge’s determination will amount solely to a determina­\ntion of law, and the Court of Appeals will review that\nconstruction de novo. See Brief for Petitioners 27, Re-\nply Brief 16; Brief for Respondents 43; see also Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 12–13.\n    In some cases, however, the district court will need to\nlook beyond the patent’s intrinsic evidence and to consult\nextrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the\nbackground science or the meaning of a term in the rele­\nvant art during the relevant time period. See, e.g., Sey-\nmour v. Osborne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88345\"><a href=\"/opinion/88345/seymour-v-osborne/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 546 (1871) (a patent may\nbe “so interspersed with technical terms and terms of art\nthat the testimony of scientific witnesses is indispensable\nto a correct understanding of its meaning”). In cases\nwhere those subsidiary facts are in dispute, courts will\nneed to make subsidiary factual findings about that ex­\ntrinsic evidence. These are the “evidentiary underpin­\nnings” of claim construction that we discussed in Mark-\nman, and this subsidiary factfinding must be reviewed for\nclear error on appeal.\n    For example, if a district court resolves a dispute be­\ntween experts and makes a factual finding that, in gen­\neral, a certain term of art had a particular meaning to a\nperson of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the inven­\ntion, the district court must then conduct a legal analysis:\nwhether a skilled artisan would ascribe that same mean­\ning to that term in the context of the specific patent claim\nunder review. That is because “[e]xperts may be examined\nto explain terms of art, and the state of the art, at any\ngiven time,” but they cannot be used to prove “the proper\nor legal construction of any instrument of writing.”\nWinans v. New York & Erie R.

Robinson, Law of Patents §732, pp.\n482–483 (1890); emphasis in original)).\n  Accordingly, the question we have answered here con­\ncerns review of the district court’s resolution of a subsidi­\nary factual dispute that helps that court determine the\nproper interpretation of the written patent claim. The\ndistrict judge, after deciding the factual dispute, will then\ninterpret the patent claim in light of the facts as he has\nfound them. This ultimate interpretation is a legal con­\nclusion. The appellate court can still review the district\ncourt’s ultimate construction of the claim de novo. But, to\noverturn the judge’s resolution of an underlying factual\ndispute, the Court of Appeals must find that the judge, in\nrespect to those factual findings, has made a clear error.\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6).\n  In some instances, a factual finding will play only a\nsmall role in a judge’s ultimate legal conclusion about the\nmeaning of the patent term. But in some instances, a\nfactual finding may be close to dispositive of the ultimate\nlegal question of the proper meaning of the term in the\ncontext of the patent. Nonetheless, the ultimate question\nof construction will remain a legal question. Simply be­\ncause a factual finding may be nearly dispositive does not\nrender the subsidiary question a legal one. “[A]n issue\ndoes not lose its factual character merely because its\nresolution is dispositive of the ultimate” legal question.\nMiller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 113 (1985). It is analogous\nto a judge (sitting without a jury) deciding whether a\ndefendant gave a confession voluntarily.

An appellate court similarly should\nreview for clear error those factual findings that underlie\na district court’s claim construction.\n                             III\n   We can illustrate our holding by considering an instance\nin which Teva, with the support of the Solicitor General,\nargues that the Federal Circuit wrongly reviewed the\nDistrict Court’s factual finding de novo. See Brief for\nPetitioners 54–56; Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 31–32. Recall that Teva’s patent claim specifies an\nactive ingredient with a “molecular weight of about 5 to 9\nkilodaltons.” Recall Sandoz’s basic argument, namely that\nthe term “molecular weight” is indefinite or ambiguous.\nThe term might refer to the weight of the most numerous\nmolecule, it might refer to weight as calculated by the\naverage weight of all molecules, or it might refer to weight\nas calculated by an average in which heavier molecules\ncount for more. The claim, Sandoz argues, does not tell us\nwhich way we should calculate weight. See Part I, supra.\n   To illustrate, imagine we have a sample of copolymer-1\n(the active ingredient) made up of 10 molecules: 4 weigh 6\nkilodaltons each, 3 weigh 8 kilodaltons each, and 3 weigh\n9 kilodaltons each. Using the first method of calculation,\nthe “molecular weight” would be 6 kilodaltons, the weight\nof the most prevalent molecule. Using the second method,\nthe molecular weight would be 7.5 (total weight, 75, di-\nvided by the number of molecules, 10). Using the third\nmethod, the molecular weight would be more than 8, depend-\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning upon how much extra weight we gave to the heavier\nmolecules.\n   Teva argued in the District Court that the term “molec­\nular weight” in the patent meant molecular weight calcu­\nlated in the first way (the weight of the most prevalent\nmolecule, or peak average molecular weight). Sandoz,\nhowever, argued that figure 1 of the patent showed that\nTeva could not be right. 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 590. (We\nhave set forth figure 1 in the Appendix, infra). That fig­\nure, said Sandoz, helped to show that the patent term did\nnot refer to the first method of calculation. Figure 1 shows\nhow the weights of a sample’s molecules were distributed\nin three different samples. The curves indicate the num­\nber of molecules of each weight that were present in each\nof the three. For example, the figure’s legend says that\nthe first sample’s “molecular weight” is 7.7. According to\nTeva, that should mean that molecules weighing 7.7 kilo­\ndaltons were the most prevalent molecules in the sample.\nBut, look at the curve, said Sandoz. It shows that the\nmost prevalent molecule weighed, not 7.7 kilodaltons, but\nslightly less than 7.7 (about 6.8) kilodaltons. See App.\n138a–139a. After all, the peak of the first molecular\nweight distribution curve (the solid curve in the figure) is\nnot at precisely 7.7 kilodaltons, but at a point just before\n7.7. Thus, argued Sandoz, the figure shows that the pa­\ntent claim term “molecular weight” did not mean molecu­\nlar weight calculated by the first method. It must mean\nsomething else. It is indefinite. 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 590.\n   The District Court did not accept Sandoz’s argument.\nTeva’s expert testified that a skilled artisan would under­\nstand that converting data from a chromatogram to mo­\nlecular weight distribution curves like those in figure 1\nwould cause the peak on each curve to shift slightly; this\ncould explain the difference between the value indicated\nby the peak of the curve (about 6.8) and the value in the\nfigure’s legend (7.7). App. 138a–139a. Sandoz’s expert\n16   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntestified that no such shift would occur. App. 375a–376a.\nThe District Court credited Teva’s expert’s account, thereby\nrejecting Sandoz’s expert’s explanation. 810 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 589; Brief for Respondents 61. The District Court’s\nfinding about this matter was a factual finding—about\nhow a skilled artisan would understand the way in which\na curve created from chromatogram data reflects molecu­\nlar weights. Based on that factual finding, the District\nCourt reached the legal conclusion that figure 1 did not\nundermine Teva’s argument that molecular weight re­\nferred to the first method of calculation (peak average\nmolecular weight). 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 590–591.\n   When the Federal Circuit reviewed the District Court’s\ndecision, it recognized that the peak of the curve did not\nmatch the 7.7 kilodaltons listed in the legend of figure 1.\n723 F. 3d, at 1369. But the Federal Circuit did not accept\nTeva’s expert’s explanation as to how a skilled artisan\nwould expect the peaks of the curves to shift. And it failed\nto accept that explanation without finding that the Dis­\ntrict Court’s contrary determination was “clearly errone­\nous.” See ibid. The Federal Circuit should have accepted\nthe District Court’s finding unless it was “clearly errone­\nous.” Our holding today makes clear that, in failing to do\nso, the Federal Circuit was wrong.\n   Teva claims that there are two additional instances in\nwhich the Federal Circuit rejected the District Court’s\nfactual findings without concluding that they were clearly\nerroneous. We leave these matters for the Federal Circuit\nto consider on remand in light of today’s opinion.\n   We vacate the Federal Circuit’s judgment, and we re­\nmand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n              Cite as: 574 U.

Swint, 456\nU. S. 273, 287 (1982), the question here is whether claim\nconstruction involves findings of fact.1 Because it does\nnot, Rule 52(a)(6) does not apply, and the Court of Appeals\nproperly applied a de novo standard of review.\n                             I\n  In reaching the contrary conclusion, the majority fails to\n——————\n  1 The majority argues that we are bound by petitioners’ phrasing of\nthe question presented and by respondents’ concession at oral argu­\nment that claim construction “will sometimes require subsidiary\nfactfinding.” Ante, at 10–11.

Unfortunately,\n“Rule 52(a) does not furnish particular guidance with\nrespect to distinguishing law from fact,” and we have\nfound it difficult to discern “any other rule or principle\nthat will unerringly” differentiate the two. Ibid. That\ninquiry is thus not as simple as pointing out the undeni-\nable “evidentiary underpinnings” of claim construction.\nAnte, at 10–11.\n  Instead, we must consider how “findings of fact” and\n“conclusions of law” were understood at the time Rule 52\nwas adopted. Cf. Tome v. United States, 513 U. S. 150,\n168 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment) (noting that, because the federal rules have\ntheir background in common-law principles, “the body of\ncommon law knowledge must be a source of guidance in\nour interpretation of the Rules” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Unfortunately, the pre-1937 evidence of this\nCourt’s treatment of evidentiary determinations underly­\ning claim construction is inconclusive. In several deci­\nsions, the Court considered extrinsic evidence related to\nclaim construction with no apparent deference to the\nDistrict Courts’ findings based on that evidence. Coupe v.\nRoyer, 155 U. S. 565, 576 (1895); Loom Co. v. Higgins, 105\nU. S. 580, 584–587 (1882); Tilghman v. Proctor, 102 U. S.\n707, 729–731 (1881); Winans v.

None of those decisions, however, expressly\nturned on a disagreement over a subsidiary evidentiary\ndetermination.\n  Absent specific evidence of the treatment of a particular\nissue at the time Rule 52 was adopted, we have drawn\nanalogies to the treatment of other issues under Rule\n52(a)(6). See, e.g., Pullman, supra, at 288. In general, we\nhave treated district-court determinations as “analytically\nmore akin to a fact” the more they pertain to a simple\nhistorical fact of the case, and as “analytically more akin\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

Fenton, 474\nU. S. 104, 116 (1985); see also Bose Corp. v. Consumers\nUnion of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485 (1984); Baum-\ngartner v. United States, 322 U. S. 665, 671 (1944). Under\nthis approach, determinations underlying claim construc­\ntion fall on the law side of the dividing line.\n                               A\n   Patents are written instruments, so other written in­\nstruments supply the logical analogy. See Markman v.\nWestview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370, 381 (1996).\nAnd as the majority recognizes, the construction of written\ninstruments is generally a question of law. See ante, at 5.\nBut in certain contexts, a court construing a written in­\nstrument makes subsidiary determinations that the law\ntreats as findings of fact.\n   The classic case of a written instrument whose construc­\ntion does not involve subsidiary findings of fact is a stat­\nute. Our treatment of subsidiary evidentiary findings\nunderlying statutory construction as conclusions of law\nmakes sense for two reasons.\n   First, although statutory construction may demand\nsome inquiry into legislative “intent,” that inquiry is an-\nalytically legal: The meaning of a statute does not turn\non what an individual lawmaker intended as a matter of\nfact, but only on what intent has been enacted into law\nthrough the constitutionally defined channels of bicamer­\nalism and presentment. See Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.\n555, 587 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\nThis remains so even if deciding what passed through\nthose channels requires a court to determine a “fact” of\nhistorical understanding through an examination of ex­\ntrinsic evidence. See, e.g., Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542\nU. S. 692, 714–715 (2004) (examining the historical under­\nstanding of the term “law of nations” when the Alien Tort\n4    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nStatute was enacted); see also, e.g., McIntyre v. Ohio\nElections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334, 359–366 (1995)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (construing a consti­\ntutional provision by asking how the words were originally\nunderstood and marshaling evidence of that understand­\ning). The Court has given no hint that this practice\nchanges when the statute it construes is a land patent—\nthat is, a public land grant. See Leo Sheep Co. v. United\nStates, 440 U. S. 668, 669 (1979) (making detailed histori­\ncal findings in the course of construing a land grant be­\ncause “ ‘courts, in construing a statute, may with propriety\nrecur to the history of the times when it was passed . . . in\norder to ascertain the reason as well as the meaning of\nparticular provisions in it’ ”); see also Marvin M. Brandt\nRevocable Trust v. United States, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014)\n(slip op., at 10) (looking to the historical background\nagainst which a land grant was passed to confirm its\ninterpretation).\n   Second, statutes govern the rights and duties of the\npublic as a whole, so subsidiary evidentiary findings shape\nlegal rules that apply far beyond the boundaries of the\ndispute involved. Our rules of construction for legislative\nacts have long been consciously shaped by the public’s\nstake in those acts. See, e.g., The Binghamton Bridge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87684\"><a href=\"/opinion/87684/the-binghamton-bridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (1866) (describing a rule of construction bor­\nrowed from English common law and reflected in the\ndecisions of the several States).\n   The construction of contracts and deeds, by contrast,\nsometimes involves subsidiary findings of fact.          Our\ntreatment of subsidiary evidentiary findings as findings of\nfact in this context makes sense because, in construing\ncontracts and deeds, “the avowed purpose and primary\nfunction of the court is to ascertain the intention of the\nparties.” 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:2, pp. 17–\n18 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston); see also Reed v. Proprietors of\nLocks and Canals on Merrimac River, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288–\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

Sometimes that intention is clearly “set forth\nin the express language of the contract,” 11 Williston\n§31:1, at 341–342, so no subsidiary findings of fact are\nnecessary to its construction, id., §30:1. But when ambi­\nguities require a court to look beyond the express lan­\nguage, its search for intent becomes factual in nature.\nThat search focuses on “real intention[s]”—embodied in an\nactual meeting of minds or an actual conveyance of a\nphysical parcel of land—that have an existence outside the\nwritten instrument and that the instrument merely rec­\nords. See William & James Brown & Co. v. McGran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86153\"><a href=\"/opinion/86153/william-james-brown-co-v-mcgran/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493 (1840) (Story, J.); Reed, supra, at 289.

For example, when a court searches for\nthe meaning that a hypothetical person “conversant with\nthe subject-matter with which the contract is dealing”\nwould give to the words of the contract, its conclusion\noften remains one of law.

App., p. 686.\n   The question we must ask, then, is whether the subsidi­\nary findings underlying claim construction more closely\nresemble the subsidiary findings underlying the construc­\ntion of statutes or those underlying the construction of\ncontracts and deeds that are treated as findings of fact.\nThis, in turn, depends on whether patent claims are more\n6    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nlike statutes or more like contracts and deeds.\n                               B\n   A patent, generally speaking, is “an official document\nreflecting a grant by a sovereign that is made public, or\n‘patent.’ ” Marvin M. Brandt Revocable Trust, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 5). Invention patents originated not as private\nproperty rights, but as royal prerogatives. See 4 W.\nHoldsworth, A History of English Law 350–351 (1924).\nThey could be issued and revoked only by the Crown,\nwhich sometimes used the patent to delegate governmen­\ntal power to regulate an industry. Id., at 344–347. Pro­\nvoked by the Crown’s use of these so-called “monopoly\npatents” to promote private economic interests over inno­\nvation and beneficial commerce, Parliament enacted the\nStatute of Monopolies in 1624. Id., at 353. But even\nunder the regime that Parliament put in place, patents\nremained sovereign grants, issued, enforced, and revoked\nby the Privy Council. Lemley, Why Do Juries Decide if\nPatents are Valid? 99 Va. L. Rev. 1673, 1681 (2013).\n   The Framers adopted a similar scheme. Article I of the\nU. S. Constitution vests the patent power in Congress,\nauthorizing it “[t]o promote the Progress of Science and\nuseful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and\nInventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings\nand Discoveries.” U. S. Const. Art. I, §8, cl. 8. Although\nCongress could issue such patents as special statutes, see,\ne.g., Bloomer v. McQuewan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86806\"><a href=\"/opinion/86806/bloomer-v-mcquewan/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549–550 (1853),\nit has mostly acted by authorizing the Executive Branch to\nissue patents when certain statutory requirements are\nmet. See 35 U. S. C. §151; see also Act of July 8, 1870,\n§31, 16 Stat. 202; Act of July 4, 1836, §7, 5 Stat. 119; Act\nof Apr. 10, 1790, ch. 7, §1, 1 Stat. 109–110.\n   Like the royal prerogatives that were their historical\nantecedents, patents have a regulatory effect: They “re­\nstrain others from manufacturing, using or selling that\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwhich [the patent holder] has invented” for a specified\nperiod of time. Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal\nFilm Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502, 510 (1917) (emphasis added).\nAnd because the regulatory scope of a patent is deter­\nmined by the claims in the patent, the subsidiary findings\nthat a court makes during claim construction contribute to\nrules that limit conduct by the public at large.\n  Because they are governmental dispositions and provide\nrules that bind the public at large, patent claims resemble\nstatutes. The scope of a patent holder’s monopoly right is\ndefined by claims legally actualized through the proce­\ndures established by Congress pursuant to its patent\npower. Thus, a patent holder’s actual intentions have\neffect only to the extent that they are expressed in the\npublic record. See Keystone Bridge Co. v. Phoenix Iron\nCo., 95 U. S. 274, 279 (1877); see also Goodyear Dental\nVulcanite Co. v. Davis, 102 U. S. 222, 227 (1880) (examin­\ning “the avowed understanding of the patentee,” but dis­\nclaiming any holding that such understanding “c[ould] be\nallowed to enlarge, diminish, or vary the language of a\npatent afterwards issued”).\n  Moreover, because the ultimate meaning of a patent\nclaim, like the ultimate meaning of a statute, binds the\npublic at large, it should not depend on the specific evi­\ndence presented in a particular infringement case. Al­\nthough the party presentations shape even statutory con-\nstruction, de novo review on appeal helps to ensure that\nthe construction is not skewed by the specific evidence\npresented in a given case.\n                            C\n  For purposes of construction, contracts and deeds are\nless natural analogies for patents. In particular, patents\nlack the characteristics of those instruments that have\njustified departing from the usual practice of treating\ndocument construction as a wholly legal inquiry, not sub­\n8    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nject to subsidiary findings of fact.\n  To be sure, we have occasionally characterized a patent\nas “a carefully crafted bargain” between the inventor and\nthe public.

But, as\nour decisions have also recognized, the patent is perhaps\nbetter characterized as a reward for feats already accom­\nplished—that is, innovation and public disclosure—than\nas a mutual exchange of executory promises. See, e.g.,\nMotion Picture Patents Co., supra, at 513; Seymour v.\nOsborne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88345\"><a href=\"/opinion/88345/seymour-v-osborne/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 533–534 (1871); Grant, supra, at\n242; see also Markman v.

In grant­\ning a patent, the Government is acting not as a party to a\nbilateral contract binding upon itself alone, but instead as\na sovereign bestowing upon the inventor a right to exclude\nthe public at large from the invention marked out by his\nclaims.\n  In this sense, patents are more closely analogous to\ndeeds, Motion Picture Patents Co., supra, at 510 (collecting\ncases), because they share the common characteristic of\ndescribing rights that the owner holds against the world.\nSee Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489\nU. S. 141, 162 (1989). But in the context of land patents,\nwe have been unwilling to interpret sovereign dispositions\nin the same way we interpret analogous private convey­\nances. See, e.g., Leo Sheep Co., 440 U. S., at 680–682;\nMissouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Kansas Pacific R. Co., 97 U. S.\n491, 497 (1878); Leavenworth, L. & G. R. Co. v. United\nStates, 92 U.

But the subsidiary\ndeterminations about patent claims that the majority\nidentifies as factual do not concern historical facts, such as\nwhat the parties agreed to do or how a given parcel of land\n——————\n   2 The Anglo-American legal tradition has long distinguished between\n\n“core” private rights—including the traditional property rights repre­\nsented by deeds—and other types of rights. Nelson, Adjudication in the\nPolitical Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 567 (2007) (Nelson). These\nother rights fall into two categories: “ ‘public rights belonging to the\npeople at large,’ ” and “privileges” or “franchises,” “which public author­\nities ha[ve] created purely for reasons of public policy and which ha[ve]\nno counterpart in the Lockean state of nature.” Id., at 566–567 Not­\nwithstanding a movement to recognize a “core” property right in inven­\ntions, the English common law placed patents squarely in the final\ncategory, as franchises that “depend upon express legislation,” and\n“hath [their] essence by positive municipal law.” 7 W. Holdsworth, A\nHistory of English Law 479, n. 7, 480, and n. 4, 497 (1926). The distinc­\ntion between “core” private rights, on the one hand, and public rights\nand government-created privileges, on the other, has traditionally had\nsignificant implications for the way in which rights are adjudicated.\nNelson, supra. Thus, no matter how closely a franchise resembles some\n“core” private right, it does not follow that it must be subject to the\nsame rules of judicial interpretation as its counterpart.\n   Cases interpreting deeds and land patents exemplify this rule and\nshow why the majority’s assertion that patents affect fewer people than\nstatutes, in addition to being a dubious overgeneralization, is not a\nmaterial distinction. Land patents are more like deeds than statutes in\nthe sense that their effects are more localized, yet the judicial power\napproaches them differently because they dispose of public rights held\nby the government on behalf of the people, Nelson 566.

SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nis situated. See William & James Brown & Co., 14 Pet., at\n493; Reed, 8 How., at 289.\n   For example, the “fact” of how a skilled artisan would\nunderstand a given term or phrase at a particular point in\nhistory is a legal fiction; it has no existence independent of\nthe claim construction process. There is no actual “skilled\nartisan” who, at the moment the application was filed,\nformed an understanding of the terms of the claim—an\nunderstanding that an omniscient factfinder could ascer­\ntain. Neither is the skilled artisan’s understanding a\nproxy for some external fact that, could the court know it,\nwould supply the meaning of a patent claim. Whatever\nthe scope of the inventor’s right under the patent before\nthe introduction of claims, the law has limited that right\nto the claims as written in the patent. See Markman,\nsupra, at 379. Our decision in Markman rested in part on\nthis characteristic of claim construction, distinguishing it\nfrom other patent determinations that must go to a jury\nbecause they require the factfinder to inspect “ ‘an embod­\nied conception outside of the patent itself ’ ” or things\n“ ‘which have their existence in pais.’ ” 517 U.

S. 285, 292 (1922), the major-\nity compares the search for the meaning of “ ‘technical\nwords or phrases not commonly understood’ ” in claim\nconstruction to “questions of fact” about the scope of a\nrailway tariff. See ante, at 6. It is true that, in Great\nNorthern, the Court referred to questions of fact arising in\nthe context of contract construction, which, it pointed out,\nmust go to a jury. 259 U. S., at 292–293. But the Court’s\nconclusion that similar questions must be settled by the\nInterstate Commerce Commission (ICC) when they relate\nto the interpretation of a railway tariff merely proves the\npoint that the allocation of a technical usage inquiry de­\npends upon the legal instrument that the court is constru­\ning. In that case, the Court was faced with a tariff filed\nwith, and administered by, the ICC. And it was not con­\ncerned with allocating evidentiary determinations be­\ntween trial and appellate courts, but with allocating them\nbetween an agency and the judiciary. Id., at 289. So\nunderstood, the distinction the Court drew pertains more\nto an emerging rule of administrative deference than to a\ndefinitive classification of judicial determinations.\n   Further reinforcing the point that the nature of the legal\ninstrument dictates our treatment of subsidiary findings is\nthat, although terms in statutes and regulations frequently\nhave technical meanings unknown outside the special-\nized community they are meant to regulate, we treat the\ninquiry into those meanings as involving only conclusions\nof law. See, e.g., Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Hiles, 516\nU. S. 400, 401–407, 413–414 (1996); Aluminum Co. of\nAmerica v. Central Lincoln Peoples’ Util. Dist., 467 U. S.\n380, 390 (1984). The majority’s unexamined reliance on\ntechnical usage could be read to cast doubt on this prac­\ntice, as well as on our holding in Markman that claim\nconstruction is exclusively for the court. If claim construc­\ntion involves subsidiary questions of technical meaning or\n12   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nusage that are indistinguishable from those questions\nsubmitted to the jury in the contract context, see 12 Wil­\nliston §34:19, then one might wonder why such issues are\nnot submitted to the jury in the patent and statute con­\ntexts, too.\n   The majority also analogizes to the obviousness inquiry\nin patent law, which involves findings of fact subject to\nRule 52(a)(6). Ante, at 11 (citing Dennison Mfg. Co. v.\nPanduit Corp., 475 U. S. 809, 811 (1986) (per curiam)).\nBut this analogy is even further off the mark because\nobviousness turns on historical facts about the circum­\nstances of the invention, rather than on the construction of\na written instrument. Id., at 810–811. Cf. Markman,\nsupra, at 386 (distinguishing the novelty inquiry from\nclaim construction on these grounds).\n                              B\n   Nor does the majority attempt to justify its holding by\nreference to which “ ‘judicial actor is better positioned . . .\nto decide the issue in question,’ ” Markman, supra, at\n388—an inquiry that we have also treated as relevant to\nthe classification of fact versus law, Miller, 474 U. S., at\n114. In resolving issues of judicial administration, we\nhave considered that federal appellate courts are “exposi­\ntor[s] of law,” ibid., and have acknowledged that they are\nbetter positioned than district courts to promote uniform-\nity, Markman, supra, at 390; see also Ornelas v. United\nStates, 517 U. S. 690, 697–698 (1996). We have recog­\nnized, however, that trial courts have a special competence\nin judging witness credibility and weighing the evidence,\nMiller, supra, at 114, and have been cautious not to waste\njudicial and party resources through needless relitigation,\nsee Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 575 (1985).\n   To the extent that the construction of a patent claim\nturns on testimony of expert witnesses, especially live\ntestimony, there is no denying that it falls within the\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          13\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbounds of a district court’s special competence. But as we\nrecognized in Markman, and as the majority is careful to\nreiterate today, “subsidiary factfinding is unlikely to loom\nlarge in the universe of litigated claim construction.”\nAnte, at 10. The majority’s reluctance to highlight “alloca­\ntion,” Miller, supra at 113, is thus understandable. The\narguments favoring allocation to the district court, dimin­\nished by the majority’s own prediction, are outweighed by\nthe remaining rule-of-law and uniformity considerations\nthat factored into our allocation in Markman, 517 U. S., at\n388–391.\n                               1\n   We have long been cautious not to allocate issues in a\nway that would “strip a federal appellate court of its pri­\nmary function as an expositor of law.” Miller, 474 U. S., at\n114. Although we have recognized that “an issue does not\nlose its factual character merely because its resolution is\ndispositive of the ultimate” dispute, id., at 113, we have\nbeen less inclined to defer to seemingly factual determina­\ntions that play a dispositive role in the development of\nlegal rules. For example, we have sanctioned de novo\nappellate review of the mixed determinations of “probable\ncause” and “reasonable suspicion” on the ground that “the\nlegal rules . . . acquire content only through application.”\nOrnelas, supra, 697; see also Miller, supra, at 116. Al-\nthough such determinations depend on the specific facts in\na case, their role in shaping rules of law demand a de novo\nstandard of review.\n   As previously noted, patents are authoritative govern­\nmental dispositions. Thus, when a judge construes a\npatent, he is, in a very real sense, “say[ing] what the law\nis,” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803), not\njust for the parties to the dispute, but for the public at\nlarge. It follows that, any time a district court’s claim\nconstruction turns on subsidiary evidentiary disputes, the\n14   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmajority’s rule will distort the appellate court’s construc­\ntion of the law by requiring it to defer to subsidiary deter­\nminations that are dispositive as to its meaning. Surely\nthe majority would not countenance such an abdication\nof the appellate court’s role in the construction of statutes.\nYet the majority has not justified applying a different rule\nto the construction of legislative acts that take the form of\na patent.\n                              2\n  The need for uniformity in claim construction also\nweighs heavily in favor of de novo review of subsidiary\nevidentiary determinations. Uniformity is a critical fea­\nture of our patent system because “ ‘[t]he limits of a patent\nmust be known for the protection of the patentee, the\nencouragement of the inventive genius of others and the\nassurance that the subject of the patent will be dedicated\nultimately to the public.’ ” Markman, 517 U. S., at 390. If\nthe boundaries of the patent right could shift from case to\ncase, then the result would be “a ‘zone of uncertainty\nwhich enterprise and experimentation may enter only at\nthe risk of infringement.’ ” Ibid.; see also Festo Corp. v.\nShoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U. S. 722, 731\n(2002). So damaging is this unpredictability that we\nidentified uniformity as an “independent” reason justify­\ning our allocation of claim construction to the court. See\nMarkman, supra, at 390.\n  The majority attempts to downplay the effect its deci­\nsion will have on uniformity by pointing out that “prior\ncases [construing the same claim] will sometimes be bind­\ning because of issue preclusion, and sometimes will serve\nas persuasive authority.” Ante, at 9–10 (citing Markman,\nsupra, at 391; citation omitted). But we have already\nrejected the notion that issue preclusion adequately safe­\nguards the uniformity that our patent system requires.\nSee Markman, supra, at 391.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   Perhaps the majority is correct that “subsidiary factfind­\ning is unlikely to loom large in the universe of litigated\nclaim construction.” Ante, at 10. But I doubt it. If this\ncase proves anything, it is that the line between fact and\nlaw is an uncertain one—made all the more uncertain by\nthe majority’s failure to identify sound principles for the\nlines it draws. The majority’s rule provides litigants who\nprevail in district court a significant opportunity and\nincentive to take advantage of this uncertainty by arguing\non appeal that the district court’s claim construction in­\nvolved subsidiary findings of fact. At best, today’s holding\nwill spawn costly—and, if the majority is correct about the\nfrequency with which these evidentiary determinations\nmake a difference, meritless—collateral litigation over the\nline between law and fact. We generally avoid any rule of\njudicial administration that “results in a substantial\nexpenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult ques­\ntions that have no effect on the outcome of the case,” Pear-\nson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236–237 (2009), and there\nis no reason to embrace one here. But I fear worse: that\ntoday’s decision will result in fewer claim construction\ndecisions receiving precedential effect, thereby injecting\nuncertainty into the world of invention and innovation.\n   In short, the majority’s rule finds no support in either\nthe historical understanding of “findings of fact” or consid­\nerations of policy that have served as our guide when we\nhave been confronted with a difficult question of fact-law\nclassification. I would not adopt it.\n                             III\n  The Court of Appeals reviewed de novo not only the\nDistrict Court’s claim construction, but also its holding\nthat the claims were sufficiently definite to satisfy 35\nU. S. C. §112, ¶2 (2006 ed.). I would hold that the Court of\nAppeals correctly treated the indefiniteness inquiry as a\nquestion of law because it depends entirely on claim\n16   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nconstruction.\n   “[A] patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read\nin light of the specification delineating the patent, and the\nprosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable cer­\ntainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the in­\nvention.” Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 1). This standard falls\nsomewhere between a notice requirement and a prohibi­\ntion on ambiguity. See id., at ___ –___ (slip op., at 9–11).\nDetermining whether a claim is indefinite is thus akin to\nother legal inquiries commonly performed in the course of\ninterpreting written instruments. See, e.g., Mayo Founda-\ntion for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562\nU.

S. 837 (1984)); 11\nWilliston §30:5, at 75 (“The determination of whether a\ncontract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court”).\nThus, a holding that a patent satisfies the definiteness\nrequirement does not turn on “findings of fact” as that\nterm is used in Rule 52(a)(6), and the Court of Appeals\nproperly applied a de novo standard of review.\n                      *     *     *\n  Although it relied on expert testimony to understand\nthe science underlying petitioners’ claims, the District\nCourt made no “findings of fact” as that term is used in\nRule 52(a)(6).

Argued October 15, 2014—Decided January 20, 2015\nPetitioners, Teva Pharmaceuticals (and related firms), own a patent\n  that covers a manufacturing method for the multiple sclerosis drug\n  Copaxone. When respondents, Sandoz, Inc. (and other firms), tried to\n  market a generic version of the drug, Teva sued them for patent in­\n  fringement. Sandoz countered that the patent was invalid. Specifi­\n  cally, Sandoz argued that the claim that Copaxone’s active ingredient\n  had “a molecular weight of 5 to 9 kilodaltons” was fatally indefinite,\n  see 35 U. S. C. §112 ¶2, because it did not state which of three meth­\n  ods of calculation—the weight of the most prevalent molecule, the\n  weight as calculated by the average weight of all molecules, or weight\n  as calculated by an average in which heavier molecules count for\n  more—was used to determine that weight. After considering conflict­\n  ing expert evidence, the District Court concluded that the patent\n  claim was sufficiently definite and the patent was thus valid. As rel­\n  evant here, it found that in context a skilled artisan would under­\n  stand that the term “molecular weight” referred to molecular weight\n  as calculated by the first method. In finding the “molecular weight”\n  term indefinite and the patent invalid on appeal, the Federal Circuit\n  reviewed de novo all aspects of the District Court’s claim construc­\n  tion, including the District Court’s determination of subsidiary facts.\nHeld: When reviewing a district court’s resolution of subsidiary factual\n matters made in the course of its construction of a patent claim, the\n Federal Circuit must apply a “clear error,” not a de novo, standard of\n review. Pp. 4–16.\n    (a) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6) states that a court of\n appeals “must not . . . set aside” a district court’s “[f]indings of fact”\n unless they are “clearly erroneous.” It sets out a “clear command,”\n2       TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574, and “does not make\n    exceptions or . . . exclude certain categories of factual findings” from\n    the court of appeals’ obligation, Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456\n    U. S. 273, 287. The Rule thus applies to both subsidiary and ulti­\n    mate facts. Ibid. And the function of an appeals court reviewing the\n    findings of a “ ‘district court sitting without a jury . . . is not to decide\n    factual issues de novo.’ ” Anderson, supra, at 573. Even if exceptions\n    to the Rule were permissible, there is no convincing ground for creat­\n    ing an exception here. Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517\n    U. S. 370, neither created, nor argued for, such an exception. There,\n    the Court held that the ultimate question of claim construction is for\n    the judge, not the jury, id., at 372, but it did not thereby create an ex­\n    ception from the ordinary rule governing appellate review of factual\n    matters. Instead, the Court pointed out that a judge, in construing a\n    patent claim, is engaged in much the same task as the judge would\n    be in construing other written instruments, such as deeds, contracts,\n    or tariffs. Id., at 384, 386, 388, 389. Construction of written instru­\n    ments often presents a “question solely of law,” at least when the\n    words in those instruments are “used in their ordinary meaning.”\n    Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., 259 U. S. 285, 291.\n    But if a written instrument uses “technical words or phrases not\n    commonly understood,” id., at 292, those words may give rise to a fac­\n    tual dispute. If so, extrinsic evidence may help to “establish a usage\n    of trade or locality.” Ibid. And in that circumstance, the “determina­\n    tion of the matter of fact” will “preced[e]” the “function of construc­\n    tion.” Ibid.\n       The Markman Court also recognized that courts will sometimes\n    have to resolve subsidiary factual disputes in patent construction;\n    Rule 52 requires appellate courts to review such disputes under the\n    “clearly erroneous” standard. Application of this standard is further\n    supported by precedent and by practical considerations. Clear error\n    review is “particularly” important in patent cases because a district\n    court judge who has presided over, and listened to, the entire pro­\n    ceeding has a comparatively greater opportunity to gain the neces­\n    sary “familiarity with specific scientific problems and principles,”\n    Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U. S. 605,\n    610, than an appeals court judge who must read a written transcript\n    or perhaps just those portions referenced by the parties. Pp. 4–8.\n       (b) Arguments to the contrary are unavailing. Sandoz claims that\n    separating “factual” from “legal” questions may be difficult and, like\n    the Federal Circuit, posits that it is simpler for the appellate court to\n    review the entirety of the district court’s claim construction de novo\n    than to apply two separate standards. But courts of appeals have\n    long been able to separate factual from legal matters, see, e.g., First\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 947–948, and the\n  Federal Circuit’s efforts to treat factual findings and legal conclu­\n  sions similarly have brought with them their own complexities. As\n  for Sandoz’s argument that “clear error” review will bring about less\n  uniformity, neither the Circuit nor Sandoz has shown that divergent\n  claim construction stemming from divergent findings of fact on sub­\n  sidiary matters should occur more than occasionally. Pp. 8–11.\n     (c) This leaves the question of how the clear error standard should\n  be applied when reviewing subsidiary factfinding in patent claim\n  construction. When the district court reviews only evidence intrinsic\n  to the patent, the judge’s determination is solely a determination of\n  law, and the court of appeals will review that construction de novo.\n  However, where the district court needs to consult extrinsic evidence\n  in order to understand, for example, the background science or the\n  meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time peri­\n  od, and where those subsidiary facts are in dispute, courts will need\n  to make subsidiary factual findings about the extrinsic evidence. The\n  district judge, after deciding the factual dispute, will then interpret\n  the patent claim in light of the facts as he has found them. The ulti­\n  mate construction of the claim is a legal conclusion that the appellate\n  court can review de novo. But to overturn the judge’s resolution of an\n  underlying factual dispute, the appellate court must find that the\n  judge, in respect to those factual findings, has made a clear error.\n  Pp. 11–14.\n     (d) Here, for example, the District Court made a factual finding,\n  crediting Teva’s expert’s account, and thereby rejecting Sandoz’s ex­\n  pert’s contrary explanation, about how a skilled artisan would under­\n  stand the way in which a curve created from chromatogram data re­\n  flects molecular weights. Based on that factual finding, the District\n  Court reached the legal conclusion that figure 1 did not undermine\n  Teva’s argument that molecular weight referred to the first method of\n  calculating molecular weight. When the Federal Circuit reviewed the\n  District Court’s decision, it did not accept Teva’s expert’s explanation,\n  and it failed to accept that explanation without finding that the Dis­\n  trict Court’s contrary determination was “clearly erroneous.” The\n  Federal Circuit erred in failing to review this factual finding only for\n  clear error. Teva asserts that there are two additional instances in\n  which the Federal Circuit rejected the District Court’s factual find­\n  ings without concluding that they were clearly erroneous; those mat­\n  ters are left for the Federal Circuit to consider on remand.

Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S.\n370 (1996), we explained that a patent claim is that “por­\ntion of the patent document that defines the scope of the\npatentee’s rights.” Id., at 372. We held that “the con­\nstruction of a patent, including terms of art within its\nclaim,” is not for a jury but “exclusively” for “the court” to\ndetermine. Ibid. That is so even where the construction\nof a term of art has “evidentiary underpinnings.” Id., at\n390.\n   Today’s case involves claim construction with “eviden­\ntiary underpinnings.” See Part III, infra. And, it requires\nus to determine what standard the Court of Appeals\nshould use when it reviews a trial judge’s resolution of an\nunderlying factual dispute. Should the Court of Appeals\nreview the district court’s factfinding de novo as it would\nreview a question of law? Or, should it review that fact-\nfinding as it would review a trial judge’s factfinding in\nother cases, namely by taking them as correct “unless\nclearly erroneous?” See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6). We\nhold that the appellate court must apply a “clear error,”\n2    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot a de novo, standard of review.\n                                I\n   The basic dispute in this case concerns the meaning of\nthe words “molecular weight” as those words appear in a\npatent claim. The petitioners, Teva Pharmaceuticals\n(along with related firms), own the relevant patent. The\npatent covers a manufacturing method for Copaxone, a\ndrug used to treat multiple sclerosis. The drug’s active\ningredient, called “copolymer-1,” is made up of molecules\nof varying sizes. App. 1143a. And the relevant claim\ndescribes that ingredient as having “a molecular weight of\n5 to 9 kilodaltons.” Id., at 1145a.\n   The respondents, Sandoz, Inc. (and several other firms),\ntried to market a generic version of Copaxone. Teva sued\nSandoz for patent infringement. 810 F. Supp. 2d 578, 581\n(SDNY 2011). Sandoz defended the suit by arguing that\nthe patent was invalid. Ibid. The Patent Act requires\nthat a claim “particularly poin[t] out and distinctly clai[m]\nthe subject matter which the applicant regards as his\ninvention.” 35 U. S. C. §112 ¶2 (2006 ed.); see Nautilus,\nInc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1\n(2014) (slip op., at 3, n. 1)). The phrase “molecular weight\nof 5 to 9 kilodaltons,” said Sandoz, did not satisfy this\nrequirement.\n   The reason that the phrase is fatally indefinite, Sandoz\nargued, is that, in the context of this patent claim, the\nterm “molecular weight” might mean any one of three\ndifferent things. The phrase might refer (1) to molecular\nweight as calculated by the weight of the molecule that is\nmost prevalent in the mix that makes up copolymer-1.\n(The scientific term for molecular weight so calculated is,\nwe are told, “peak average molecular weight.”) The phrase\nmight refer (2) to molecular weight as calculated by taking\nall the different-sized molecules in the mix that makes up\ncopolymer-1 and calculating the average weight, i.e.,\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nadding up the weight of each molecule and dividing by the\nnumber of molecules. (The scientific term for molecular\nweight so calculated is, we are told, “number average\nmolecular weight.”) Or, the phrase might refer (3) to\nmolecular weight as calculated by taking all the different-\nsized molecules in the mix that makes up copolymer-1 and\ncalculating their average weight while giving heavier\nmolecules a weight-related bonus when doing so. (The\nscientific term for molecular weight so calculated, we are\ntold, is “weight average molecular weight.”) See 723 F. 3d\n1363, 1367 (CA Fed. 2013); App. 124a. In Sandoz’s view,\nsince Teva’s patent claim does not say which method of\ncalculation should be used, the claim’s phrase “molecular\nweight” is indefinite, and the claim fails to satisfy the\ncritical patent law requirement.\n   The District Court, after taking evidence from experts,\nconcluded that the patent claim was sufficiently definite.\nAmong other things, it found that in context a skilled\nartisan would understand that the term “molecular\nweight” referred to molecular weight as calculated by the\nfirst method, i.e., “peak average molecular weight.” 810\nF. Supp. 2d, at 596; see Nautilus, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n12) (“[T]he definiteness inquiry trains on the understand­\ning of a skilled artisan at the time of the patent applica­\ntion”). In part for this reason, the District Court held the\npatent valid. 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 596.\n   On appeal, the Federal Circuit held to the contrary. It\nfound that the term “molecular weight” was indefinite.\nAnd it consequently held the patent invalid. 723 F. 3d, at\n1369. In reaching this conclusion, the Federal Circuit\nreviewed de novo all aspects of the District Court’s claim\nconstruction, including the District Court’s determination\nof subsidiary facts. Id., at 1369, 1373; see also Light-\ning Ballast Control LLC v. Philips Electronics North\nAm. Corp., 744 F. 3d 1272, 1276–1277 (CA Fed. 2014) (en\nbanc) (reaffirming de novo review of district court claim\n4    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconstruction).\n   Teva filed a petition for certiorari. And we granted that\npetition. The Federal Circuit reviews the claim construc­\ntion decisions of federal district courts throughout the\nNation, and we consequently believe it important to clarify\nthe standard of review that it must apply when doing so.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6) states that a\ncourt of appeals “must not . . . set aside” a district court’s\n“[f ]indings of fact” unless they are “clearly erroneous.” In\nour view, this rule and the standard it sets forth must\napply when a court of appeals reviews a district court’s\nresolution of subsidiary factual matters made in the\ncourse of its construction of a patent claim. We have made\nclear that the Rule sets forth a “clear command.” Ander-\nson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574 (1985). “It does\nnot make exceptions or purport to exclude certain catego­\nries of factual findings from the obligation of a court of\nappeals to accept a district court’s findings unless clearly\nerroneous.” Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S. 273,\n287 (1982). Accordingly, the Rule applies to both subsidi­\nary and ultimate facts. Ibid. And we have said that,\nwhen reviewing the findings of a “ ‘district court sitting\nwithout a jury, appellate courts must constantly have in\nmind that their function is not to decide factual issues\nde novo.’ ” Anderson, supra, at 573 (quoting Zenith Radio\nCorp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U. S. 100, 123\n(1969)).\n   Even if exceptions to the Rule were permissible, we\ncannot find any convincing ground for creating an excep­\ntion to that Rule here. The Rules Advisory Committee\npointed out that, in general, exceptions “would tend to\nundermine the legitimacy of the district courts . . . , multi­\nply appeals . . . , and needlessly reallocate judicial author­\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

App., pp. 908–909; see also\nAnderson, supra, at 574–575 (de novo review of fac-\ntual findings “would very likely contribute only negligibly”\nto accuracy “at a huge cost in diversion of judicial\nresources”).\n   Our opinion in Markman neither created, nor argued\nfor, an exception to Rule 52(a). The question presented in\nthat case was a Seventh Amendment question: Should a\njury or a judge construe patent claims? 517 U. S., at 372.\nWe pointed out that history provides no clear answer. Id.,\nat 388. The task primarily involves the construction of\nwritten instruments. Id., at 386, 388, 389. And that task\nis better matched to a judge’s skills. Id., at 388 (“The\nconstruction of written instruments is one of those things\nthat judges often do and are likely to do better than jurors\nunburdened by training in exegesis”). We consequently\nheld that claim construction falls “exclusively within the\nprovince of the court,” not that of the jury. Id., at 372.\n   When describing claim construction we concluded that it\nwas proper to treat the ultimate question of the proper\nconstruction of the patent as a question of law in the way\nthat we treat document construction as a question of law.\nId., at 388–391. But this does not imply an exception to\nRule 52(a) for underlying factual disputes. We used the\nterm “question of law” while pointing out that a judge, in\nconstruing a patent claim, is engaged in much the same\ntask as the judge would be in construing other written\ninstruments, such as deeds, contracts, or tariffs. Id., at\n384, 386, 388, 389; see also Motion Picture Patents Co. v.\nUniversal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502, 510 (1917) (patent\nclaims are “aptly likened to the description in a deed,\nwhich sets the bounds to the grant which it contains”);\nGoodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. v. Davis, 102 U. S. 222, 227\n(1880) (analogizing patent construction to the construction\nof other written instruments like contracts). Construction\n6    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof written instruments often presents a “question solely of\nlaw,” at least when the words in those instruments are\n“used in their ordinary meaning.” Great Northern R. Co.\nv. Merchants Elevator Co., 259 U. S. 285, 291 (1922). But\nsometimes, say when a written instrument uses “technical\nwords or phrases not commonly understood,” id., at 292,\nthose words may give rise to a factual dispute. If so, ex­\ntrinsic evidence may help to “establish a usage of trade or\nlocality.” Ibid. And in that circumstance, the “determina­\ntion of the matter of fact” will “preced[e]” the “function of\nconstruction.” Ibid.; see also 12 R. Lord, Williston on\nContracts §§34:1, p. 2, 34:19, p. 174 (4th ed. 2012) (In\ncontract interpretation, the existence of a “usage”—a\n“practice or method” in the relevant industry—“is a ques­\ntion of fact” (internal quotation marks omitted)). This\nfactual determination, like all other factual determina­\ntions, must be reviewed for clear error. See Pullman-\nStandard, supra at 287 (The Rule does not “exclude cer­\ntain categories of factual findings” and applies to both\n“subsidiary” and “ultimate” facts (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   Accordingly, when we held in Markman that the ulti­\nmate question of claim construction is for the judge and\nnot the jury, we did not create an exception from the ordi­\nnary rule governing appellate review of factual matters.\nMarkman no more creates an exception to Rule 52(a) than\nwould a holding that judges, not juries, determine equit­\nable claims, such as requests for injunctions. A conclusion\nthat an issue is for the judge does not indicate that Rule\n52(a) is inapplicable. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52 (setting\nthe standard of review for “[Factual] Findings and Conclu­\nsions by the Court” (emphasis added)).\n   While we held in Markman that the ultimate issue of\nthe proper construction of a claim should be treated as a\nquestion of law, we also recognized that in patent con­\nstruction, subsidiary factfinding is sometimes necessary.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nIndeed, we referred to claim construction as a practice\nwith “evidentiary underpinnings,” a practice that “falls\nsomewhere between a pristine legal standard and a simple\nhistorical fact.” 517 U. S., at 378, 388, 390. We added\nthat sometimes courts may have to make “credibility\njudgments” about witnesses. Id., at 389. In other words,\nwe recognized that courts may have to resolve subsidiary\nfactual disputes. And, as explained above, the Rule re­\nquires appellate courts to review all such subsidiary fac­\ntual findings under the “clearly erroneous” standard.\n   Precedent further supports application of the “clearly\nerroneous” standard. Before the creation of the Federal\nCircuit, the Second Circuit explained that in claim con­\nstruction, the subsidiary “question . . . of how the art un-\nderstood the term . . . was plainly a question of fact; and\nunless the [district court’s] finding was ‘clearly erroneous,’\nwe are to take” it “as controlling.” Harries v. Air King\nProducts, Co., 183 F. 2d 158, 164 (CA2 1950) (L. Hand,\nC. J.). We have said the same as to subsidiary factual\nfindings concerning other patent law inquiries, including\n“obviousness.” Dennison Mfg. Co. v. Panduit Corp., 475\nU. S. 809, 811 (1986) (per curiam) (“subsidiary determina­\ntions of the District Court” subject to Rule 52(a)’s clear\nerror standard).\n   Finally, practical considerations favor clear error re­\nview. We have previously pointed out that clear error\nreview is “particularly” important where patent law is at\nissue because patent law is “a field where so much de­\npends upon familiarity with specific scientific problems\nand principles not usually contained in the general store­\nhouse of knowledge and experience.” Graver Tank & Mfg.\nCo. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U. S. 605, 610 (1950). A\ndistrict court judge who has presided over, and listened to,\nthe entirety of a proceeding has a comparatively greater\nopportunity to gain that familiarity than an appeals court\njudge who must read a written transcript or perhaps just\n8    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v.

Cf.\nLighting Ballast, 744 F. 3d, at 1311 (O’Malley, J., dissent­\ning) (Federal Circuit judges “lack the tools that district\ncourts have available to resolve factual disputes fairly and\naccurately,” such as questioning the experts, examining\nthe invention in operation, or appointing a court-appointed\nexpert); Anderson, 470 U. S., at 574 (“The trial judge’s\nmajor role is the determination of fact, and with experi­\nence in fulfilling that role comes expertise”).\n                              B\n   Sandoz argues that claim construction mostly consists of\nconstruing a set of written documents that do not give rise\nto subsidiary factual disputes. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39. It adds\nthat separating “factual” from “legal” questions is often\ndifficult. And Sandoz, like the Federal Circuit itself,\nargues that it is simpler for that appellate court to review\nthe entirety of the district court’s claim construction de\nnovo rather than to apply two separate standards. Id., at\n38; see also Lighting Ballast, supra, at 1284 (criticizing\nclear error review in part because of the purportedly diffi­\ncult task of “disentangling” fact from law).\n   But even were we free to ignore the Federal Rule (which\nwe are not), we would not find this argument convincing.\nCourts of appeals have long found it possible to separate\nfactual from legal matters. See, e.g., First Options of\nChicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 947–948 (1995)\n(review of factual findings for clear error and legal conclu­\nsions de novo is the “ordinary” standard for courts of ap­\npeals). At the same time, the Federal Circuit’s efforts to\ntreat factual findings and legal conclusions similarly have\nbrought with them their own complexities. See e.g., Cybor\nCorp. v. FAS Technologies, Inc., 138 F. 3d 1448, 1454 (CA\nFed. 1998) (en banc) (claim construction does not involve\n“factual evidentiary findings” (citation and internal quota­\ntion marks omitted)); Lighting Ballast, supra, at 1284\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Menell et al. as\nAmici Curiae 5 (Federal Circuit overturns district court\nclaim construction at unusually high rate).\n   Finally, the Circuit feared that “clear error” review\nwould bring about less uniformity. Lighting Ballast,\nsupra, at 1280. Neither the Circuit nor Sandoz, however,\nhas shown that (or explained why) divergent claim con­\nstruction stemming from divergent findings of fact (on\nsubsidiary matters) should occur more than occasionally.\nAfter all, the Federal Circuit will continue to review de\nnovo the district court’s ultimate interpretation of the\npatent claims. And the attorneys will no doubt bring cases\nconstruing the same claim to the attention of the trial\njudge; those prior cases will sometimes be binding because\nof issue preclusion, see Markman, 517 U. S., at 391, and\nsometimes will serve as persuasive authority. Moreover,\n10   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nit is always possible to consolidate for discovery different\ncases that involve construction of the same claims. And,\nas we said in Markman, subsidiary factfinding is unlikely\nto loom large in the universe of litigated claim construc­\ntion. Id., at 389–390.\n                             C\n  The dissent argues that claim construction does not\ninvolve any “factfinding,” or, if it does, claim construction\nfactfinding is akin to the factfinding that underlies our\ninterpretation of statutes. Post, at 1, 5–7 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.). Its first, broader contention runs contrary to\nour recognition in Markman that claim construction has\n“evidentiary underpinnings” and that courts construing\npatent claims must sometimes make “credibility judg­\nments” about witnesses. 517 U. S., at 389–390. Indeed, as\ndiscussed in Part III, infra, this case provides a perfect\nexample of the factfinding that sometimes underlies claim\nconstruction: The parties here presented the District\nCourt with competing fact-related claims by different\nexperts, and the District Court resolved the issues of fact\nthat divided those experts.\n  The dissent’s contention also runs contrary to Sandoz’s\nconcession at oral argument that claim construction will\nsometimes require subsidiary factfinding. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n33–34, 38–40. It is in tension with our interpretation of\nrelated areas of patent law, such as the interpretation of\n“obviousness,” which we have said involves subsidiary\nfactfinding subject to Rule 52(a)’s clear error review. See\nDennison, 475 U. S., at 811. And it fights the question\npresented in this case, which assumes the existence of\nsuch factfinding. See Pet. for Cert. i (whether “a district\ncourt’s factual finding in support of its construction of a\npatent claim term may be reviewed de novo, . . . or only\nfor clear error”).\n  Neither do we find factfinding in this context sufficiently\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsimilar to the factfinding that underlies statutory inter­\npretation. Statutes, in general, address themselves to the\ngeneral public; patent claims concern a small portion of\nthat public. Statutes typically (though not always) rest\nupon congressional consideration of general facts related\nto a reasonably broad set of social circumstances; patents\ntypically (though not always) rest upon consideration by a\nfew private parties, experts, and administrators of more\nnarrowly circumscribed facts related to specific technical\nmatters. The public, and often an adversarial public,\ntypically considers and discusses the relevant general\nfacts before Congress enacts a statute; only private par­\nties, experts, and administrators likely consider the rele­\nvant technical facts before the award of a patent. Given\nthese differences, it is not surprising that this Court has\nnever previously compared patent claim construction in\nany here relevant way to statutory construction. As dis­\ncussed supra, at 5, however, the Court has repeatedly\ncompared patent claim construction to the construction of\nother written instruments such as deeds and contracts.\nSee, e.g., Markman, supra, at 384, 386, 388, 389; Motion\nPicture Patent Co., 243 U. S., at 510; Goodyear, 102 U. S.,\nat 227.\n                             D\n  Now that we have set forth why the Federal Circuit\nmust apply clear error review when reviewing subsidiary\nfactfinding in patent claim construction, it is necessary to\nexplain how the rule must be applied in that context. We\nrecognize that a district court’s construction of a patent\nclaim, like a district court’s interpretation of a written\ninstrument, often requires the judge only to examine and\nto construe the document’s words without requiring the\njudge to resolve any underlying factual disputes. As all\nparties agree, when the district court reviews only evi­\ndence intrinsic to the patent (the patent claims and speci­\n12   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfications, along with the patent’s prosecution history), the\njudge’s determination will amount solely to a determina­\ntion of law, and the Court of Appeals will review that\nconstruction de novo. See Brief for Petitioners 27, Re-\nply Brief 16; Brief for Respondents 43; see also Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 12–13.\n    In some cases, however, the district court will need to\nlook beyond the patent’s intrinsic evidence and to consult\nextrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the\nbackground science or the meaning of a term in the rele­\nvant art during the relevant time period. See, e.g., Sey-\nmour v. Osborne, 11 Wall. 516, 546 (1871) (a patent may\nbe “so interspersed with technical terms and terms of art\nthat the testimony of scientific witnesses is indispensable\nto a correct understanding of its meaning”). In cases\nwhere those subsidiary facts are in dispute, courts will\nneed to make subsidiary factual findings about that ex­\ntrinsic evidence. These are the “evidentiary underpin­\nnings” of claim construction that we discussed in Mark-\nman, and this subsidiary factfinding must be reviewed for\nclear error on appeal.\n    For example, if a district court resolves a dispute be­\ntween experts and makes a factual finding that, in gen­\neral, a certain term of art had a particular meaning to a\nperson of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the inven­\ntion, the district court must then conduct a legal analysis:\nwhether a skilled artisan would ascribe that same mean­\ning to that term in the context of the specific patent claim\nunder review. That is because “[e]xperts may be examined\nto explain terms of art, and the state of the art, at any\ngiven time,” but they cannot be used to prove “the proper\nor legal construction of any instrument of writing.”\nWinans v. New York & Erie R. Co., 21 How. 88, 100–101\n(1859); see also Markman, supra, at 388 (“ ‘Where tech­\nnical terms are used, or where the qualities of substances\n. . . or any similar data necessary to the comprehension of\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe language of the patent are unknown to the judge, the\ntestimony of witnesses may be received upon these sub­\njects, and any other means of information be employed.\nBut in the actual interpretation of the patent the court\nproceeds upon its own responsibility, as an arbiter of the\nlaw, giving to the patent its true and final character and\nforce’ ” (quoting 2 W. Robinson, Law of Patents §732, pp.\n482–483 (1890); emphasis in original)).\n  Accordingly, the question we have answered here con­\ncerns review of the district court’s resolution of a subsidi­\nary factual dispute that helps that court determine the\nproper interpretation of the written patent claim. The\ndistrict judge, after deciding the factual dispute, will then\ninterpret the patent claim in light of the facts as he has\nfound them. This ultimate interpretation is a legal con­\nclusion. The appellate court can still review the district\ncourt’s ultimate construction of the claim de novo. But, to\noverturn the judge’s resolution of an underlying factual\ndispute, the Court of Appeals must find that the judge, in\nrespect to those factual findings, has made a clear error.\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6).\n  In some instances, a factual finding will play only a\nsmall role in a judge’s ultimate legal conclusion about the\nmeaning of the patent term. But in some instances, a\nfactual finding may be close to dispositive of the ultimate\nlegal question of the proper meaning of the term in the\ncontext of the patent. Nonetheless, the ultimate question\nof construction will remain a legal question. Simply be­\ncause a factual finding may be nearly dispositive does not\nrender the subsidiary question a legal one. “[A]n issue\ndoes not lose its factual character merely because its\nresolution is dispositive of the ultimate” legal question.\nMiller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 113 (1985). It is analogous\nto a judge (sitting without a jury) deciding whether a\ndefendant gave a confession voluntarily. The answer to\nthe legal question about the voluntariness of the confes­\n14   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsion may turn upon the answer to a subsidiary factual\nquestion, say “whether in fact the police engaged in the\nintimidation tactics alleged by the defendant.” Id., at 112.\nAn appellate court will review the trial judge’s factual\ndetermination about the alleged intimidation deferentially\n(though, after reviewing the factual findings, it will review\na judge’s ultimate determination of voluntariness de novo).\nSee id., at 112–118. An appellate court similarly should\nreview for clear error those factual findings that underlie\na district court’s claim construction.\n                             III\n   We can illustrate our holding by considering an instance\nin which Teva, with the support of the Solicitor General,\nargues that the Federal Circuit wrongly reviewed the\nDistrict Court’s factual finding de novo. See Brief for\nPetitioners 54–56; Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 31–32. Recall that Teva’s patent claim specifies an\nactive ingredient with a “molecular weight of about 5 to 9\nkilodaltons.” Recall Sandoz’s basic argument, namely that\nthe term “molecular weight” is indefinite or ambiguous.\nThe term might refer to the weight of the most numerous\nmolecule, it might refer to weight as calculated by the\naverage weight of all molecules, or it might refer to weight\nas calculated by an average in which heavier molecules\ncount for more. The claim, Sandoz argues, does not tell us\nwhich way we should calculate weight. See Part I, supra.\n   To illustrate, imagine we have a sample of copolymer-1\n(the active ingredient) made up of 10 molecules: 4 weigh 6\nkilodaltons each, 3 weigh 8 kilodaltons each, and 3 weigh\n9 kilodaltons each. Using the first method of calculation,\nthe “molecular weight” would be 6 kilodaltons, the weight\nof the most prevalent molecule. Using the second method,\nthe molecular weight would be 7.5 (total weight, 75, di-\nvided by the number of molecules, 10). Using the third\nmethod, the molecular weight would be more than 8, depend-\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning upon how much extra weight we gave to the heavier\nmolecules.\n   Teva argued in the District Court that the term “molec­\nular weight” in the patent meant molecular weight calcu­\nlated in the first way (the weight of the most prevalent\nmolecule, or peak average molecular weight). Sandoz,\nhowever, argued that figure 1 of the patent showed that\nTeva could not be right. 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 590. (We\nhave set forth figure 1 in the Appendix, infra). That fig­\nure, said Sandoz, helped to show that the patent term did\nnot refer to the first method of calculation. Figure 1 shows\nhow the weights of a sample’s molecules were distributed\nin three different samples. The curves indicate the num­\nber of molecules of each weight that were present in each\nof the three. For example, the figure’s legend says that\nthe first sample’s “molecular weight” is 7.7. According to\nTeva, that should mean that molecules weighing 7.7 kilo­\ndaltons were the most prevalent molecules in the sample.\nBut, look at the curve, said Sandoz. It shows that the\nmost prevalent molecule weighed, not 7.7 kilodaltons, but\nslightly less than 7.7 (about 6.8) kilodaltons. See App.\n138a–139a. After all, the peak of the first molecular\nweight distribution curve (the solid curve in the figure) is\nnot at precisely 7.7 kilodaltons, but at a point just before\n7.7. Thus, argued Sandoz, the figure shows that the pa­\ntent claim term “molecular weight” did not mean molecu­\nlar weight calculated by the first method. It must mean\nsomething else. It is indefinite. 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 590.\n   The District Court did not accept Sandoz’s argument.\nTeva’s expert testified that a skilled artisan would under­\nstand that converting data from a chromatogram to mo­\nlecular weight distribution curves like those in figure 1\nwould cause the peak on each curve to shift slightly; this\ncould explain the difference between the value indicated\nby the peak of the curve (about 6.8) and the value in the\nfigure’s legend (7.7). App. 138a–139a. Sandoz’s expert\n16   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntestified that no such shift would occur. App. 375a–376a.\nThe District Court credited Teva’s expert’s account, thereby\nrejecting Sandoz’s expert’s explanation. 810 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 589; Brief for Respondents 61. The District Court’s\nfinding about this matter was a factual finding—about\nhow a skilled artisan would understand the way in which\na curve created from chromatogram data reflects molecu­\nlar weights. Based on that factual finding, the District\nCourt reached the legal conclusion that figure 1 did not\nundermine Teva’s argument that molecular weight re­\nferred to the first method of calculation (peak average\nmolecular weight). 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 590–591.\n   When the Federal Circuit reviewed the District Court’s\ndecision, it recognized that the peak of the curve did not\nmatch the 7.7 kilodaltons listed in the legend of figure 1.\n723 F. 3d, at 1369. But the Federal Circuit did not accept\nTeva’s expert’s explanation as to how a skilled artisan\nwould expect the peaks of the curves to shift. And it failed\nto accept that explanation without finding that the Dis­\ntrict Court’s contrary determination was “clearly errone­\nous.” See ibid. The Federal Circuit should have accepted\nthe District Court’s finding unless it was “clearly errone­\nous.” Our holding today makes clear that, in failing to do\nso, the Federal Circuit was wrong.\n   Teva claims that there are two additional instances in\nwhich the Federal Circuit rejected the District Court’s\nfactual findings without concluding that they were clearly\nerroneous. We leave these matters for the Federal Circuit\nto consider on remand in light of today’s opinion.\n   We vacate the Federal Circuit’s judgment, and we re­\nmand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n              Cite as: 574 U.

Swint, 456\nU. S. 273, 287 (1982), the question here is whether claim\nconstruction involves findings of fact.1 Because it does\nnot, Rule 52(a)(6) does not apply, and the Court of Appeals\nproperly applied a de novo standard of review.\n                             I\n  In reaching the contrary conclusion, the majority fails to\n——————\n  1 The majority argues that we are bound by petitioners’ phrasing of\nthe question presented and by respondents’ concession at oral argu­\nment that claim construction “will sometimes require subsidiary\nfactfinding.” Ante, at 10–11.

Ibid. That\ninquiry is thus not as simple as pointing out the undeni-\nable “evidentiary underpinnings” of claim construction.\nAnte, at 10–11.\n  Instead, we must consider how “findings of fact” and\n“conclusions of law” were understood at the time Rule 52\nwas adopted. Cf. Tome v. United States, 513 U. S. 150,\n168 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment) (noting that, because the federal rules have\ntheir background in common-law principles, “the body of\ncommon law knowledge must be a source of guidance in\nour interpretation of the Rules” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Unfortunately, the pre-1937 evidence of this\nCourt’s treatment of evidentiary determinations underly­\ning claim construction is inconclusive. In several deci­\nsions, the Court considered extrinsic evidence related to\nclaim construction with no apparent deference to the\nDistrict Courts’ findings based on that evidence. Coupe v.\nRoyer, 155 U. S. 565, 576 (1895); Loom Co. v. Higgins, 105\nU. S. 580, 584–587 (1882); Tilghman v. Proctor, 102 U. S.\n707, 729–731 (1881); Winans v. Denmead, 15 How. 330,\n339 (1854). None of those decisions, however, expressly\nturned on a disagreement over a subsidiary evidentiary\ndetermination.\n  Absent specific evidence of the treatment of a particular\nissue at the time Rule 52 was adopted, we have drawn\nanalogies to the treatment of other issues under Rule\n52(a)(6). See, e.g., Pullman, supra, at 288. In general, we\nhave treated district-court determinations as “analytically\nmore akin to a fact” the more they pertain to a simple\nhistorical fact of the case, and as “analytically more akin\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nto . . . a legal conclusion” the more they define rules appli­\ncable beyond the parties’ dispute. Miller v. Fenton, 474\nU. S. 104, 116 (1985); see also Bose Corp. v. Consumers\nUnion of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485 (1984); Baum-\ngartner v. United States, 322 U. S. 665, 671 (1944). Under\nthis approach, determinations underlying claim construc­\ntion fall on the law side of the dividing line.\n                               A\n   Patents are written instruments, so other written in­\nstruments supply the logical analogy. See Markman v.\nWestview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370, 381 (1996).\nAnd as the majority recognizes, the construction of written\ninstruments is generally a question of law. See ante, at 5.\nBut in certain contexts, a court construing a written in­\nstrument makes subsidiary determinations that the law\ntreats as findings of fact.\n   The classic case of a written instrument whose construc­\ntion does not involve subsidiary findings of fact is a stat­\nute. Our treatment of subsidiary evidentiary findings\nunderlying statutory construction as conclusions of law\nmakes sense for two reasons.\n   First, although statutory construction may demand\nsome inquiry into legislative “intent,” that inquiry is an-\nalytically legal: The meaning of a statute does not turn\non what an individual lawmaker intended as a matter of\nfact, but only on what intent has been enacted into law\nthrough the constitutionally defined channels of bicamer­\nalism and presentment. See Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.\n555, 587 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\nThis remains so even if deciding what passed through\nthose channels requires a court to determine a “fact” of\nhistorical understanding through an examination of ex­\ntrinsic evidence. See, e.g., Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542\nU. S. 692, 714–715 (2004) (examining the historical under­\nstanding of the term “law of nations” when the Alien Tort\n4    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nStatute was enacted); see also, e.g., McIntyre v. Ohio\nElections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334, 359–366 (1995)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (construing a consti­\ntutional provision by asking how the words were originally\nunderstood and marshaling evidence of that understand­\ning). The Court has given no hint that this practice\nchanges when the statute it construes is a land patent—\nthat is, a public land grant. See Leo Sheep Co. v. United\nStates, 440 U. S. 668, 669 (1979) (making detailed histori­\ncal findings in the course of construing a land grant be­\ncause “ ‘courts, in construing a statute, may with propriety\nrecur to the history of the times when it was passed . . . in\norder to ascertain the reason as well as the meaning of\nparticular provisions in it’ ”); see also Marvin M. Brandt\nRevocable Trust v. United States, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014)\n(slip op., at 10) (looking to the historical background\nagainst which a land grant was passed to confirm its\ninterpretation).\n   Second, statutes govern the rights and duties of the\npublic as a whole, so subsidiary evidentiary findings shape\nlegal rules that apply far beyond the boundaries of the\ndispute involved. Our rules of construction for legislative\nacts have long been consciously shaped by the public’s\nstake in those acts. See, e.g., The Binghamton Bridge, 3\nWall. 51, 75 (1866) (describing a rule of construction bor­\nrowed from English common law and reflected in the\ndecisions of the several States).\n   The construction of contracts and deeds, by contrast,\nsometimes involves subsidiary findings of fact.          Our\ntreatment of subsidiary evidentiary findings as findings of\nfact in this context makes sense because, in construing\ncontracts and deeds, “the avowed purpose and primary\nfunction of the court is to ascertain the intention of the\nparties.” 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:2, pp. 17–\n18 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston); see also Reed v. Proprietors of\nLocks and Canals on Merrimac River, 8 How. 274, 288–\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n289 (1850). Sometimes that intention is clearly “set forth\nin the express language of the contract,” 11 Williston\n§31:1, at 341–342, so no subsidiary findings of fact are\nnecessary to its construction, id., §30:1. But when ambi­\nguities require a court to look beyond the express lan­\nguage, its search for intent becomes factual in nature.\nThat search focuses on “real intention[s]”—embodied in an\nactual meeting of minds or an actual conveyance of a\nphysical parcel of land—that have an existence outside the\nwritten instrument and that the instrument merely rec­\nords. See William & James Brown & Co. v. McGran, 14\nPet. 479, 493 (1840) (Story, J.); Reed, supra, at 289. See\ngenerally Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 10 Ct. Cl.\n548, 577–578 (1874) (declining to interpret a contract-like\nstatute according to contract rules because “[a]ll the terms\nof the compact are dictated and accepted by one side, and\nthe only intent which judicial construction can make\ncertain is the intent of the legislative power”), cited in 3 N.\nSinger, Sutherland on Statutory Construction §63:1, p.\n405, n. 6 (7th ed. 2008).\n   Of course, not all subsidiary inquiries that a court\nmakes in the course of construing contracts amount to\nfindings of fact. For example, when a court searches for\nthe meaning that a hypothetical person “conversant with\nthe subject-matter with which the contract is dealing”\nwould give to the words of the contract, its conclusion\noften remains one of law. Silver King Coalition Mines Co.\nof Nevada v. Silver King Consol. Mining Co. of Utah, 204\nF. 166 (CA8 1913), cited in Advisory Committee’s 1937\nNotes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 686.\n   The question we must ask, then, is whether the subsidi­\nary findings underlying claim construction more closely\nresemble the subsidiary findings underlying the construc­\ntion of statutes or those underlying the construction of\ncontracts and deeds that are treated as findings of fact.\nThis, in turn, depends on whether patent claims are more\n6    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nlike statutes or more like contracts and deeds.\n                               B\n   A patent, generally speaking, is “an official document\nreflecting a grant by a sovereign that is made public, or\n‘patent.’ ” Marvin M. Brandt Revocable Trust, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 5). Invention patents originated not as private\nproperty rights, but as royal prerogatives. See 4 W.\nHoldsworth, A History of English Law 350–351 (1924).\nThey could be issued and revoked only by the Crown,\nwhich sometimes used the patent to delegate governmen­\ntal power to regulate an industry. Id., at 344–347. Pro­\nvoked by the Crown’s use of these so-called “monopoly\npatents” to promote private economic interests over inno­\nvation and beneficial commerce, Parliament enacted the\nStatute of Monopolies in 1624. Id., at 353. But even\nunder the regime that Parliament put in place, patents\nremained sovereign grants, issued, enforced, and revoked\nby the Privy Council. Lemley, Why Do Juries Decide if\nPatents are Valid? 99 Va. L. Rev. 1673, 1681 (2013).\n   The Framers adopted a similar scheme. Article I of the\nU. S. Constitution vests the patent power in Congress,\nauthorizing it “[t]o promote the Progress of Science and\nuseful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and\nInventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings\nand Discoveries.” U. S. Const. Art. I, §8, cl. 8. Although\nCongress could issue such patents as special statutes, see,\ne.g., Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539, 549–550 (1853),\nit has mostly acted by authorizing the Executive Branch to\nissue patents when certain statutory requirements are\nmet. See 35 U. S. C. §151; see also Act of July 8, 1870,\n§31, 16 Stat. 202; Act of July 4, 1836, §7, 5 Stat. 119; Act\nof Apr. 10, 1790, ch. 7, §1, 1 Stat. 109–110.\n   Like the royal prerogatives that were their historical\nantecedents, patents have a regulatory effect: They “re­\nstrain others from manufacturing, using or selling that\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwhich [the patent holder] has invented” for a specified\nperiod of time. Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal\nFilm Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502, 510 (1917) (emphasis added).\nAnd because the regulatory scope of a patent is deter­\nmined by the claims in the patent, the subsidiary findings\nthat a court makes during claim construction contribute to\nrules that limit conduct by the public at large.\n  Because they are governmental dispositions and provide\nrules that bind the public at large, patent claims resemble\nstatutes. The scope of a patent holder’s monopoly right is\ndefined by claims legally actualized through the proce­\ndures established by Congress pursuant to its patent\npower. Thus, a patent holder’s actual intentions have\neffect only to the extent that they are expressed in the\npublic record. See Keystone Bridge Co. v. Phoenix Iron\nCo., 95 U. S. 274, 279 (1877); see also Goodyear Dental\nVulcanite Co. v. Davis, 102 U. S. 222, 227 (1880) (examin­\ning “the avowed understanding of the patentee,” but dis­\nclaiming any holding that such understanding “c[ould] be\nallowed to enlarge, diminish, or vary the language of a\npatent afterwards issued”).\n  Moreover, because the ultimate meaning of a patent\nclaim, like the ultimate meaning of a statute, binds the\npublic at large, it should not depend on the specific evi­\ndence presented in a particular infringement case. Al­\nthough the party presentations shape even statutory con-\nstruction, de novo review on appeal helps to ensure that\nthe construction is not skewed by the specific evidence\npresented in a given case.\n                            C\n  For purposes of construction, contracts and deeds are\nless natural analogies for patents. In particular, patents\nlack the characteristics of those instruments that have\njustified departing from the usual practice of treating\ndocument construction as a wholly legal inquiry, not sub­\n8    TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nject to subsidiary findings of fact.\n  To be sure, we have occasionally characterized a patent\nas “a carefully crafted bargain” between the inventor and\nthe public. Pfaff v. Wells Electronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 63\n(1998); see also Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 327–328\n(1859); Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218, 242 (1832). But, as\nour decisions have also recognized, the patent is perhaps\nbetter characterized as a reward for feats already accom­\nplished—that is, innovation and public disclosure—than\nas a mutual exchange of executory promises. See, e.g.,\nMotion Picture Patents Co., supra, at 513; Seymour v.\nOsborne, 11 Wall. 516, 533–534 (1871); Grant, supra, at\n242; see also Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52\nF. 3d 967, 985, n. 14 (CA Fed. 1995), aff ’d 517 U. S. 370\n(1996) (distinguishing patents from contracts). In grant­\ning a patent, the Government is acting not as a party to a\nbilateral contract binding upon itself alone, but instead as\na sovereign bestowing upon the inventor a right to exclude\nthe public at large from the invention marked out by his\nclaims.\n  In this sense, patents are more closely analogous to\ndeeds, Motion Picture Patents Co., supra, at 510 (collecting\ncases), because they share the common characteristic of\ndescribing rights that the owner holds against the world.\nSee Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489\nU. S. 141, 162 (1989). But in the context of land patents,\nwe have been unwilling to interpret sovereign dispositions\nin the same way we interpret analogous private convey­\nances. See, e.g., Leo Sheep Co., 440 U. S., at 680–682;\nMissouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Kansas Pacific R. Co., 97 U. S.\n491, 497 (1878); Leavenworth, L. & G. R. Co. v. United\nStates, 92 U. S. 733, 740–741 (1876); see also Marvin M.\nBrandt Revocable Trust, supra (interpreting a land grant\nas a statute rather than as a deed). We should not blithely\nextend the rules governing the construction of deeds to\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

But the subsidiary\ndeterminations about patent claims that the majority\nidentifies as factual do not concern historical facts, such as\nwhat the parties agreed to do or how a given parcel of land\n——————\n   2 The Anglo-American legal tradition has long distinguished between\n\n“core” private rights—including the traditional property rights repre­\nsented by deeds—and other types of rights. Nelson, Adjudication in the\nPolitical Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 567 (2007) (Nelson). These\nother rights fall into two categories: “ ‘public rights belonging to the\npeople at large,’ ” and “privileges” or “franchises,” “which public author­\nities ha[ve] created purely for reasons of public policy and which ha[ve]\nno counterpart in the Lockean state of nature.” Id., at 566–567 Not­\nwithstanding a movement to recognize a “core” property right in inven­\ntions, the English common law placed patents squarely in the final\ncategory, as franchises that “depend upon express legislation,” and\n“hath [their] essence by positive municipal law.” 7 W. Holdsworth, A\nHistory of English Law 479, n. 7, 480, and n. 4, 497 (1926). The distinc­\ntion between “core” private rights, on the one hand, and public rights\nand government-created privileges, on the other, has traditionally had\nsignificant implications for the way in which rights are adjudicated.\nNelson, supra. Thus, no matter how closely a franchise resembles some\n“core” private right, it does not follow that it must be subject to the\nsame rules of judicial interpretation as its counterpart.\n   Cases interpreting deeds and land patents exemplify this rule and\nshow why the majority’s assertion that patents affect fewer people than\nstatutes, in addition to being a dubious overgeneralization, is not a\nmaterial distinction. Land patents are more like deeds than statutes in\nthe sense that their effects are more localized, yet the judicial power\napproaches them differently because they dispose of public rights held\nby the government on behalf of the people, Nelson 566. See also The\nBinghamton Bridge, 3 Wall. 51, 75 (1866) (interpreting a state grant of\na corporate charter as a “contract” but subject to the special common-\nlaw rule that all ambiguities must be construed in favor of the State\nbecause “in grants by the public nothing passes by implication”).\n10   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nis situated. See William & James Brown & Co., 14 Pet., at\n493; Reed, 8 How., at 289.\n   For example, the “fact” of how a skilled artisan would\nunderstand a given term or phrase at a particular point in\nhistory is a legal fiction; it has no existence independent of\nthe claim construction process. There is no actual “skilled\nartisan” who, at the moment the application was filed,\nformed an understanding of the terms of the claim—an\nunderstanding that an omniscient factfinder could ascer­\ntain. Neither is the skilled artisan’s understanding a\nproxy for some external fact that, could the court know it,\nwould supply the meaning of a patent claim. Whatever\nthe scope of the inventor’s right under the patent before\nthe introduction of claims, the law has limited that right\nto the claims as written in the patent. See Markman,\nsupra, at 379. Our decision in Markman rested in part on\nthis characteristic of claim construction, distinguishing it\nfrom other patent determinations that must go to a jury\nbecause they require the factfinder to inspect “ ‘an embod­\nied conception outside of the patent itself ’ ” or things\n“ ‘which have their existence in pais.’ ” 517 U. S., at 385–\n386 (distinguishing Bischoff v. Wethered, 9 Wall. 812\n(1870)).\n   Because the skilled artisan inquiry in claim construction\nmore closely resembles determinations categorized as\n“conclusions of law” than determinations categorized as\n“findings of fact,” I would hold that it falls outside the\nscope of Rule 52(a)(6) and is subject to de novo review.\n                            II\n\n                            A\n\n  The majority makes little effort to justify its assertion\nthat the subsidiary determinations a district court makes\nin the course of claim construction are findings of fact.\nAnd the few analogies that it attempts to draw either lack\nsupport or prove too much.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   For example, relying on Great Northern R. Co. v. Mer-\nchants Elevator Co., 259 U. S. 285, 292 (1922), the major-\nity compares the search for the meaning of “ ‘technical\nwords or phrases not commonly understood’ ” in claim\nconstruction to “questions of fact” about the scope of a\nrailway tariff. See ante, at 6. It is true that, in Great\nNorthern, the Court referred to questions of fact arising in\nthe context of contract construction, which, it pointed out,\nmust go to a jury. 259 U. S., at 292–293. But the Court’s\nconclusion that similar questions must be settled by the\nInterstate Commerce Commission (ICC) when they relate\nto the interpretation of a railway tariff merely proves the\npoint that the allocation of a technical usage inquiry de­\npends upon the legal instrument that the court is constru­\ning. In that case, the Court was faced with a tariff filed\nwith, and administered by, the ICC. And it was not con­\ncerned with allocating evidentiary determinations be­\ntween trial and appellate courts, but with allocating them\nbetween an agency and the judiciary. Id., at 289. So\nunderstood, the distinction the Court drew pertains more\nto an emerging rule of administrative deference than to a\ndefinitive classification of judicial determinations.\n   Further reinforcing the point that the nature of the legal\ninstrument dictates our treatment of subsidiary findings is\nthat, although terms in statutes and regulations frequently\nhave technical meanings unknown outside the special-\nized community they are meant to regulate, we treat the\ninquiry into those meanings as involving only conclusions\nof law. See, e.g., Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Hiles, 516\nU. S. 400, 401–407, 413–414 (1996); Aluminum Co. of\nAmerica v. Central Lincoln Peoples’ Util. Dist., 467 U. S.\n380, 390 (1984). The majority’s unexamined reliance on\ntechnical usage could be read to cast doubt on this prac­\ntice, as well as on our holding in Markman that claim\nconstruction is exclusively for the court. If claim construc­\ntion involves subsidiary questions of technical meaning or\n12   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nusage that are indistinguishable from those questions\nsubmitted to the jury in the contract context, see 12 Wil­\nliston §34:19, then one might wonder why such issues are\nnot submitted to the jury in the patent and statute con­\ntexts, too.\n   The majority also analogizes to the obviousness inquiry\nin patent law, which involves findings of fact subject to\nRule 52(a)(6). Ante, at 11 (citing Dennison Mfg. Co. v.\nPanduit Corp., 475 U. S. 809, 811 (1986) (per curiam)).\nBut this analogy is even further off the mark because\nobviousness turns on historical facts about the circum­\nstances of the invention, rather than on the construction of\na written instrument. Id., at 810–811. Cf. Markman,\nsupra, at 386 (distinguishing the novelty inquiry from\nclaim construction on these grounds).\n                              B\n   Nor does the majority attempt to justify its holding by\nreference to which “ ‘judicial actor is better positioned . . .\nto decide the issue in question,’ ” Markman, supra, at\n388—an inquiry that we have also treated as relevant to\nthe classification of fact versus law, Miller, 474 U. S., at\n114. In resolving issues of judicial administration, we\nhave considered that federal appellate courts are “exposi­\ntor[s] of law,” ibid., and have acknowledged that they are\nbetter positioned than district courts to promote uniform-\nity, Markman, supra, at 390; see also Ornelas v. United\nStates, 517 U. S. 690, 697–698 (1996). We have recog­\nnized, however, that trial courts have a special competence\nin judging witness credibility and weighing the evidence,\nMiller, supra, at 114, and have been cautious not to waste\njudicial and party resources through needless relitigation,\nsee Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 575 (1985).\n   To the extent that the construction of a patent claim\nturns on testimony of expert witnesses, especially live\ntestimony, there is no denying that it falls within the\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          13\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbounds of a district court’s special competence. But as we\nrecognized in Markman, and as the majority is careful to\nreiterate today, “subsidiary factfinding is unlikely to loom\nlarge in the universe of litigated claim construction.”\nAnte, at 10. The majority’s reluctance to highlight “alloca­\ntion,” Miller, supra at 113, is thus understandable. The\narguments favoring allocation to the district court, dimin­\nished by the majority’s own prediction, are outweighed by\nthe remaining rule-of-law and uniformity considerations\nthat factored into our allocation in Markman, 517 U. S., at\n388–391.\n                               1\n   We have long been cautious not to allocate issues in a\nway that would “strip a federal appellate court of its pri­\nmary function as an expositor of law.” Miller, 474 U. S., at\n114. Although we have recognized that “an issue does not\nlose its factual character merely because its resolution is\ndispositive of the ultimate” dispute, id., at 113, we have\nbeen less inclined to defer to seemingly factual determina­\ntions that play a dispositive role in the development of\nlegal rules. For example, we have sanctioned de novo\nappellate review of the mixed determinations of “probable\ncause” and “reasonable suspicion” on the ground that “the\nlegal rules . . . acquire content only through application.”\nOrnelas, supra, 697; see also Miller, supra, at 116. Al-\nthough such determinations depend on the specific facts in\na case, their role in shaping rules of law demand a de novo\nstandard of review.\n   As previously noted, patents are authoritative govern­\nmental dispositions. Thus, when a judge construes a\npatent, he is, in a very real sense, “say[ing] what the law\nis,” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803), not\njust for the parties to the dispute, but for the public at\nlarge. It follows that, any time a district court’s claim\nconstruction turns on subsidiary evidentiary disputes, the\n14   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmajority’s rule will distort the appellate court’s construc­\ntion of the law by requiring it to defer to subsidiary deter­\nminations that are dispositive as to its meaning. Surely\nthe majority would not countenance such an abdication\nof the appellate court’s role in the construction of statutes.\nYet the majority has not justified applying a different rule\nto the construction of legislative acts that take the form of\na patent.\n                              2\n  The need for uniformity in claim construction also\nweighs heavily in favor of de novo review of subsidiary\nevidentiary determinations. Uniformity is a critical fea­\nture of our patent system because “ ‘[t]he limits of a patent\nmust be known for the protection of the patentee, the\nencouragement of the inventive genius of others and the\nassurance that the subject of the patent will be dedicated\nultimately to the public.’ ” Markman, 517 U. S., at 390. If\nthe boundaries of the patent right could shift from case to\ncase, then the result would be “a ‘zone of uncertainty\nwhich enterprise and experimentation may enter only at\nthe risk of infringement.’ ” Ibid.; see also Festo Corp. v.\nShoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U. S. 722, 731\n(2002). So damaging is this unpredictability that we\nidentified uniformity as an “independent” reason justify­\ning our allocation of claim construction to the court. See\nMarkman, supra, at 390.\n  The majority attempts to downplay the effect its deci­\nsion will have on uniformity by pointing out that “prior\ncases [construing the same claim] will sometimes be bind­\ning because of issue preclusion, and sometimes will serve\nas persuasive authority.” Ante, at 9–10 (citing Markman,\nsupra, at 391; citation omitted). But we have already\nrejected the notion that issue preclusion adequately safe­\nguards the uniformity that our patent system requires.\nSee Markman, supra, at 391.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   Perhaps the majority is correct that “subsidiary factfind­\ning is unlikely to loom large in the universe of litigated\nclaim construction.” Ante, at 10. But I doubt it. If this\ncase proves anything, it is that the line between fact and\nlaw is an uncertain one—made all the more uncertain by\nthe majority’s failure to identify sound principles for the\nlines it draws. The majority’s rule provides litigants who\nprevail in district court a significant opportunity and\nincentive to take advantage of this uncertainty by arguing\non appeal that the district court’s claim construction in­\nvolved subsidiary findings of fact. At best, today’s holding\nwill spawn costly—and, if the majority is correct about the\nfrequency with which these evidentiary determinations\nmake a difference, meritless—collateral litigation over the\nline between law and fact. We generally avoid any rule of\njudicial administration that “results in a substantial\nexpenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult ques­\ntions that have no effect on the outcome of the case,” Pear-\nson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236–237 (2009), and there\nis no reason to embrace one here. But I fear worse: that\ntoday’s decision will result in fewer claim construction\ndecisions receiving precedential effect, thereby injecting\nuncertainty into the world of invention and innovation.\n   In short, the majority’s rule finds no support in either\nthe historical understanding of “findings of fact” or consid­\nerations of policy that have served as our guide when we\nhave been confronted with a difficult question of fact-law\nclassification. I would not adopt it.\n                             III\n  The Court of Appeals reviewed de novo not only the\nDistrict Court’s claim construction, but also its holding\nthat the claims were sufficiently definite to satisfy 35\nU. S. C. §112, ¶2 (2006 ed.). I would hold that the Court of\nAppeals correctly treated the indefiniteness inquiry as a\nquestion of law because it depends entirely on claim\n16   TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. v. SANDOZ, INC.\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nconstruction.\n   “[A] patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read\nin light of the specification delineating the patent, and the\nprosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable cer­\ntainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the in­\nvention.” Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 1). This standard falls\nsomewhere between a notice requirement and a prohibi­\ntion on ambiguity. See id., at ___ –___ (slip op., at 9–11).\nDetermining whether a claim is indefinite is thus akin to\nother legal inquiries commonly performed in the course of\ninterpreting written instruments. See, e.g., Mayo Founda-\ntion for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562\nU. S. 44, 52–53 (2011) (reviewing without deference the\ndistrict court’s determination that a statute is unambigu­\nous at step one of Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984)); 11\nWilliston §30:5, at 75 (“The determination of whether a\ncontract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court”).\nThus, a holding that a patent satisfies the definiteness\nrequirement does not turn on “findings of fact” as that\nterm is used in Rule 52(a)(6), and the Court of Appeals\nproperly applied a de novo standard of review.\n                      *     *     *\n  Although it relied on expert testimony to understand\nthe science underlying petitioners’ claims, the District\nCourt made no “findings of fact” as that term is used in\nRule 52(a)(6). Thus, the Court of Appeals properly re­\nviewed the District Court’s conclusions of law de novo. I\nrespectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2771248/", "sha1": "2519954c953e09a5ab9ab639503a49f85fe87d9c", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-01-20T08:01:15.125953"}
