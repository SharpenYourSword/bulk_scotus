Decided January 20, 2015\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Petitioner Mark Christeson’s first federal habeas peti-\ntion was dismissed as untimely. Because his appointed\nattorneys—who had missed the filing deadline—could not\nbe expected to argue that Christeson was entitled to the\nequitable tolling of the statute of limitations, Christeson\nrequested substitute counsel who would not be laboring\nunder a conflict of interest. The District Court denied the\nmotion, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\nsummarily affirmed. In so doing, these courts contra-\nvened our decision in Martel v. Clair, 565 U. S. ___ (2012).\nChristeson’s petition for certiorari is therefore granted,\nthe judgment of the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings.\n                              I\n  In 1999, a jury convicted Christeson of three counts of\ncapital murder. It returned verdicts of death on all\nthree counts. The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed\nChristeson’s conviction and sentence in 2001, see State v.\nChristeson, 50 S. W. 3d 251 (en banc), and affirmed the\ndenial of his postconviction motion for relief in 2004, see\nChristeson v. State, 131 S. W. 3d 796 (en banc).\n  Under the strict 1-year statute of limitations imposed by\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(1), Christeson’s federal\nhabeas petition was due on April 10, 2005. Nine months\nbefore this critical deadline, the District Court appointed\nattorneys Phil Horwitz and Eric Butts to represent\n2                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nChristeson in his federal habeas proceedings. See 18\nU. S. C. §3599(a)(2) (providing for appointment of counsel\nfor state death row inmates).\n   Horwitz and Butts, as they have subsequently acknowl-\nedged, failed to meet with Christeson until more than six\nweeks after his petition was due. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n93a. There is no evidence that they communicated with\ntheir client at all during this time. They finally filed the\npetition on August 5, 2005—117 days too late. They have\nsince claimed that their failure to meet with their client\nand timely file his habeas petition resulted from a simple\nmiscalculation of the AEDPA limitations period (and in\ndefending themselves, they may have disclosed privileged\nclient communications). See id., at 90a–92a, 135a. But a\nlegal ethics expert, reviewing counsel’s handling of\nChristeson’s habeas petition, stated in a report submitted\nto the District Court: “[I]f this was not abandonment, I am\nnot sure what would be.” Id., at 132a.\n   The District Court dismissed the petition as untimely,\nand the Court of Appeals denied Christeson’s application\nfor a certificate of appealability.

See id., at 229a, 231a, 237a.\n   Nearly seven years later, Horwitz and Butts contacted\nattorneys Jennifer Merrigan and Joseph Perkovich to\ndiscuss how to proceed in Christeson’s case. Merrigan and\nPerkovich immediately noticed a glaring problem.\nChristeson’s only hope for securing review of the merits of\nhis habeas claims was to file a motion under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 60(b) seeking to reopen final judgment\non the ground that AEDPA’s statute of limitations should\nhave been equitably tolled.

While initially receptive to Merrigan and\nPerkovich’s assistance, Horwitz and Butts soon refused to\nallow outside counsel access to their files. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 345a.\n   On May 23, 2014, Merrigan and Perkovich filed a mo-\ntion for substitution of counsel. The District Court denied\nthe motion, explaining only that it was “not in\n[Christeson’s] best interest to be represented by attorneys\nlocated in New York and Pennsylvania,” as Merrigan and\nPerkovich are. Id., at 169a. The District Court did not\naddress Merrigan and Perkovich’s offer to forgo all fees\nand expenses associated with travel to Missouri, nor did it\naddress the possibility of appointing other attorneys for\nChristeson.\n   Christeson appealed. The Eighth Circuit dismissed for\nlack of jurisdiction, apparently reasoning that Merrigan\nand Perkovich were not authorized to file an appeal on\nChristeson’s behalf.1 On September 19, 2014, while this\nappeal was still pending before the Eighth Circuit, the\nMissouri Supreme Court issued a warrant of execution\nsetting October 29, 2014, as Christeson’s execution date.\n   After further proceedings not relevant here, Merrigan\nand Perkovich again filed a motion for substitution of\ncounsel on Christeson’s behalf. The District Court again\ndenied the motion.        Explaining that substitution of\n“federally-appointed counsel is warranted only when it would\nserve the interests of justice,” it offered four reasons for its\ndecision. Order in No. 04–CV–08004 (WD Mo., Oct. 22,\n2014), p. 1, App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a (quoting Lambrix v.\nSecretary, Florida Dept. of Corrections, 756 F. 3d 1246,\n1259 (CA11 2014); internal quotation marks omitted).\nFirst, it deemed the motion to be untimely because it “was\nnot filed until 2014, and shortly before [Christeson’s]\n——————\n 1 Christeson has since submitted a signed retainer agreement with\n\nMerrigan and Perkovich that removes any doubt on that score.\n4                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nexecution date.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a. Second, it\nobserved that Horwitz and Butts had not “abandoned”\nChristeson, as they had recently appeared on his behalf in\na class-action lawsuit challenging Missouri’s lethal injec-\ntion protocol. Id., at 376a. Third, it noted that although\nHorwitz and Butts had represented Christeson before the\nEighth Circuit, that court had not appointed substitute\ncounsel. Ibid. Fourth and finally, the District Court\nexpressed its belief that granting the motion would set “an\nuntenable precedent” by allowing outside attorneys to seek\n“ ‘abusive’ ” delays in capital cases. Ibid.\n    Christeson again appealed. This time, the Eighth Cir-\ncuit summarily affirmed the District Court’s order. We\nstayed Christeson’s execution, see post, p. ____, and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n   Title 18 U. S. C. §3599 “entitles indigent defendants to\nthe appointment of counsel in capital cases, including\nhabeas corpus proceedings.” Martel v. Clair, 565 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 1). “By providing indigent capital defend-\nants with a mandatory right to qualified legal counsel in\nthese proceedings, Congress has recognized that federal\nhabeas corpus has a particularly important role to play in\npromoting fundamental fairness in the imposition of the\ndeath penalty.” McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 859\n(1994). Congress has not, however, conferred capital\nhabeas petitioners with the right to counsel of their choice.\nInstead, the statute leaves it to the court to select a\nproperly qualified attorney. See §§3599(a)–(d). But the\nstatute contemplates that a court may “replace” appointed\ncounsel with “similarly qualified counsel . . . upon motion”\nof the petitioner. §3599(e).\n   We addressed the standard that a court should apply in\nconsidering such a motion in Clair. We rejected the ar-\ngument that substitution of an appointed lawyer is war-\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nranted in only three situations: “when the lawyer lacks the\nqualifications necessary for appointment . . . ; when he has\na disabling conflict of interest; or when he has completely\nabandoned the client.” 565 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, we adopted a\nbroader standard, holding that a motion for substitution\nshould be granted when it is in the “ ‘interests of justice.’ ”\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 13). We further explained that the\nfactors a court of appeals should consider in determining\nwhether a district court abused its discretion in denying\nsuch a motion “include: the timeliness of the motion; the\nadequacy of the district court’s inquiry into the defend-\nant’s complaint; and the asserted cause for that complaint,\nincluding the extent of the conflict or breakdown in com-\nmunication between lawyer and client (and the client’s\nresponsibility, if any, for that conflict).” Ibid.\n   The District Court here properly recognized that its\nconsideration of Christeson’s motion for substitution was\ngoverned by Clair’s “interests of justice” standard. But its\ndenial of his motion did not adequately account for all of\nthe factors we set forth in Clair.\n   The court’s principal error was its failure to\nacknowledge Horwitz and Butts’ conflict of interest. Toll-\ning based on counsel’s failure to satisfy AEDPA’s statute\nof limitations is available only for “serious instances of\nattorney misconduct.” Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631,\n651–652 (2010). Advancing such a claim would have\nrequired Horwitz and Butts to denigrate their own per-\nformance. Counsel cannot reasonably be expected to make\nsuch an argument, which threatens their professional\nreputation and livelihood. See Restatement (Third) of\nLaw Governing Lawyers §125 (1998). Thus, as we ob-\nserved in a similar context in Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S.\n___, ___, n. 8 (2012) (slip op., at 17, n. 8), a “significant\nconflict of interest” arises when an attorney’s “interest in\navoiding damage to [his] own reputation” is at odds with\n6                   CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nhis client’s “strongest argument—i.e., that his attorneys\nhad abandoned him.”\n  Indeed, to their credit, Horwitz and Butts acknowledged\nthe nature of their conflict. Shortly before the first motion\nfor substitution was filed, they provided an update to the\nMissouri Supreme Court on the status of Christeson’s\ncollateral proceedings. In it, they stated:\n     “Because counsel herein would be essential witnesses\n     to factual questions indispensable to a Holland in-\n     quiry, there may be ethical and legal conflicts that\n     would arise that would prohibit counsel from litigat-\n     ing issues that would support a Holland claim. Un-\n     waivable ethical and legal conflicts prohibit under-\n     signed counsel from litigating these issues in any way.\n     See Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475, 485–486\n     (1978). Conflict free counsel must be appointed to\n     present the equitable tolling question in federal dis-\n     trict court.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a–49a.\n   Yet, in their response to the District Court’s order to\naddress the substitution motion, Horwitz and Butts char-\nacterized the potential arguments in favor of equitable\ntolling as “ludicrous,” and asserted that they had “a legal\nbasis and rationale for the [erroneous] calculation of the\nfiling date.” Id., at 86a, 90a. While not every case in\nwhich a counseled habeas petitioner has missed AEDPA’s\nstatute of limitations will necessarily involve a conflict of\ninterest, Horwitz and Butts’ contentions here were directly\nand concededly contrary to their client’s interest, and\nmanifestly served their own professional and reputational\ninterests.\n   Clair makes clear that a conflict of this sort is grounds\nfor substitution. Even the narrower standard we rejected\nin that case would have allowed for substitution where an\nattorney has a “ ‘disabling conflict of interest.’ ” 565 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 7). And that standard, we concluded,\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nwould “gu[t]” the specific substitution-of-counsel clause\ncontained in §3559(e), which must contemplate the grant-\ning of such motions in circumstances beyond those where a\npetitioner effectively “has no counsel at all”—as is the case\nwhen counsel is conflicted. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nIndeed, we went so far as to say that given a capital de-\nfendant’s “statutory right to counsel,” even “in the ab-\nsence” of §3599(e) a district court would be compelled “to\nappoint new counsel if the first lawyer developed a con-\nflict.” Ibid.\n   Given the obvious conflict of interest here, the consider-\nations relied upon by the District Court cannot justify its\ndecision to deny petitioner new counsel. The second and\nthird factors noted by the District Court—that appointed\ncounsel continued to represent Christeson in litigation\nchallenging the means of his execution, and that the\nEighth Circuit had not previously substituted counsel—\nare not substantial. Whether Horwitz and Butts had\ncurrently “abandoned” Christeson is beside the point:\nEven if they were actively representing him in some mat-\nters, their conflict prevented them from representing him\nin this particular matter. Likewise, it is irrelevant that\nthe Eighth Circuit had not previously sua sponte directed\nsubstitution of counsel in the course of denying\nChristeson’s request for a certificate of appealabilty and\nadjudicating his challenge to Missouri’s execution protocol,\nwhen the conflict was not evident.\n   The first and fourth factors cited by the District Court—\nthe delay in seeking substitution and the potential for\nabuse—might be valid considerations in many cases. See\nClair, 565 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (“Protecting against\nabusive delay is an interest of justice”). But under the\ncircumstances here, these factors alone cannot warrant\ndenial of substitution. Christeson’s first substitution\nmotion, while undoubtedly delayed, was not abusive. It\nwas filed approximately a month after outside counsel\n8                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nbecame aware of Christeson’s plight and well before the\nState had set an execution date, and it requested only 90\ndays to investigate and file a Rule 60(b) motion.\n  Nor is it plain that any subsequent motion that substi-\ntute counsel might file on Christeson’s behalf would be\nfutile. See id., at ___ – ___ (slip op., at 15–16) (affirming\ndenial of substitution motion as untimely where any filing\nmade by substitute counsel would have been futile). To be\nsure, Christeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to\nhaving a federal court consider his habeas petition. Al-\nthough Christeson might properly raise a claim for relief\npursuant to Rule 60(b), see Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S.\n524, 535–536 (2005), to obtain such relief he must demon-\nstrate both the motion’s timeliness and, more significant\nhere, that “ ‘extraordinary circumstances’ justif[y] the\nreopening of a final judgment.” Id., at 535 (quoting\nAckermann v. United States, 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950)).\nThat, in turn, will require Christeson to show that he was\nentitled to the equitable tolling of AEDPA’s statute of\nlimitations. He should have that opportunity, and is\nentitled to the assistance of substitute counsel in doing so.\n                        *     *    *\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in\nforma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Eighth\nCircuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                    Cite as: 574 U.

Decided January 20, 2015\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   I would not reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals\nin this case without briefing and argument. As the Court\nacknowledges, petitioner cannot obtain review of the\nmerits of his federal habeas claims without showing that\nthe applicable statute of limitations should have been\nequitably tolled, ante, at 2, and the availability of equit-\nable tolling in cases governed by the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) is a question\nof great importance.\n   AEDPA sought to ameliorate the lengthy delay that had\noften characterized federal habeas proceedings in the\npast.* See Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202, 206 (2003)\n(“Congress enacted AEDPA to reduce delays in the execu-\ntion of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in\ncapital cases”). AEDPA thus imposed a strict 1-year time\nlimit for filing a federal habeas petition. 28 U. S. C.\n§2244(d). If this 1-year period were equitably tolled\nwhenever a habeas petitioner’s attorney missed the dead-\nline and thus rendered ineffective assistance, the 1-year\nperiod would be of little value, and the days of seemingly\ninterminable federal habeas review would return. In\n\n——————\n  * Members of this Court have lamented the delay that often occurs in\ncapital cases. Johnson v. Bredesen, 558 U. S. 1067, 1067–1070 (2009)\n(Stevens, J., statement respecting denial of certiorari), Elledge v.\nFlorida, 525 U. S. 944, 944–946 (1998) (BREYER, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari).\n2                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nHolland, the Court held that the AEDPA statute of limita-\ntions may be equitably tolled—but only under quite ex-\ntraordinary circumstances. Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S.\n631, 651–652 (2010). Any expansion or further delinea-\ntion of such circumstances should not be undertaken\nwithout the careful consideration that is possible only\nafter the normal procedure of full briefing and argument.\n   The Court believes that briefing and argument are not\nnecessary in this case, and my understanding of the\nCourt’s decision is that it expresses no view whatsoever on\nthe question whether petitioner may ultimately be entitled\nto equitable tolling. I understand the Court to hold only\nthat conflict-free substitute counsel should have been\nappointed for the purposes of investigating the facts re-\nlated to the issue of equitable tolling and presenting what-\never argument can be mounted in support of a request for\nthat relief.\n   Based on the present record, it is not clear that this case\ninvolves anything other than an error, albeit a serious one,\non the part of the attorneys who represented petitioner at\nthe time when his federal habeas petition was due to be\nfiled. According to those attorneys, they miscalculated the\ndue date and as a result filed the petition after the time\nhad run. They met with petitioner to discuss the habeas\npetition prior to the date on which they say they thought\nthe petition was due but after the date on which it was\nactually due. These facts show nothing more than attor-\nney error and thus fall short of establishing the kind of\nabandonment that is needed for equitable tolling under\nour precedent. See id., at 651–652. I do not understand\nthe Court’s opinion to hold otherwise.\n   Because of the close relationship between the question\nthat the Court decides (the propriety of the District\nCourt’s refusal to appoint substitute counsel) and the\nquestion of petitioner’s entitlement to equitable tolling, I\nthink that plenary review would have been more appro-\n                Cite as: 574 U.

The District Court denied\nthe motion, explaining only that it was “not in\n[Christeson’s] best interest to be represented by attorneys\nlocated in New York and Pennsylvania,” as Merrigan and\nPerkovich are. Id., at 169a. The District Court did not\naddress Merrigan and Perkovich’s offer to forgo all fees\nand expenses associated with travel to Missouri, nor did it\naddress the possibility of appointing other attorneys for\nChristeson.\n   Christeson appealed. The Eighth Circuit dismissed for\nlack of jurisdiction, apparently reasoning that Merrigan\nand Perkovich were not authorized to file an appeal on\nChristeson’s behalf.1 On September 19, 2014, while this\nappeal was still pending before the Eighth Circuit, the\nMissouri Supreme Court issued a warrant of execution\nsetting October 29, 2014, as Christeson’s execution date.\n   After further proceedings not relevant here, Merrigan\nand Perkovich again filed a motion for substitution of\ncounsel on Christeson’s behalf. The District Court again\ndenied the motion.        Explaining that substitution of\n“federally-appointed counsel is warranted only when it would\nserve the interests of justice,” it offered four reasons for its\ndecision. Order in No. 04–CV–08004 (WD Mo., Oct. 22,\n2014), p. 1, App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a (quoting Lambrix v.\nSecretary, Florida Dept. of Corrections, 756 F. 3d 1246,\n1259 (CA11 2014); internal quotation marks omitted).\nFirst, it deemed the motion to be untimely because it “was\nnot filed until 2014, and shortly before [Christeson’s]\n——————\n 1 Christeson has since submitted a signed retainer agreement with\n\nMerrigan and Perkovich that removes any doubt on that score.\n4                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nexecution date.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a. Second, it\nobserved that Horwitz and Butts had not “abandoned”\nChristeson, as they had recently appeared on his behalf in\na class-action lawsuit challenging Missouri’s lethal injec-\ntion protocol. Id., at 376a. Third, it noted that although\nHorwitz and Butts had represented Christeson before the\nEighth Circuit, that court had not appointed substitute\ncounsel. Ibid. Fourth and finally, the District Court\nexpressed its belief that granting the motion would set “an\nuntenable precedent” by allowing outside attorneys to seek\n“ ‘abusive’ ” delays in capital cases. Ibid.\n    Christeson again appealed. This time, the Eighth Cir-\ncuit summarily affirmed the District Court’s order. We\nstayed Christeson’s execution, see post, p. ____, and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n   Title 18 U. S. C. §3599 “entitles indigent defendants to\nthe appointment of counsel in capital cases, including\nhabeas corpus proceedings.” Martel v. Clair, 565 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 1). “By providing indigent capital defend-\nants with a mandatory right to qualified legal counsel in\nthese proceedings, Congress has recognized that federal\nhabeas corpus has a particularly important role to play in\npromoting fundamental fairness in the imposition of the\ndeath penalty.” McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 859\n(1994). Congress has not, however, conferred capital\nhabeas petitioners with the right to counsel of their choice.\nInstead, the statute leaves it to the court to select a\nproperly qualified attorney. See §§3599(a)–(d). But the\nstatute contemplates that a court may “replace” appointed\ncounsel with “similarly qualified counsel . . . upon motion”\nof the petitioner. §3599(e).\n   We addressed the standard that a court should apply in\nconsidering such a motion in Clair. We rejected the ar-\ngument that substitution of an appointed lawyer is war-\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nranted in only three situations: “when the lawyer lacks the\nqualifications necessary for appointment . . . ; when he has\na disabling conflict of interest; or when he has completely\nabandoned the client.” 565 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, we adopted a\nbroader standard, holding that a motion for substitution\nshould be granted when it is in the “ ‘interests of justice.’ ”\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 13). We further explained that the\nfactors a court of appeals should consider in determining\nwhether a district court abused its discretion in denying\nsuch a motion “include: the timeliness of the motion; the\nadequacy of the district court’s inquiry into the defend-\nant’s complaint; and the asserted cause for that complaint,\nincluding the extent of the conflict or breakdown in com-\nmunication between lawyer and client (and the client’s\nresponsibility, if any, for that conflict).” Ibid.\n   The District Court here properly recognized that its\nconsideration of Christeson’s motion for substitution was\ngoverned by Clair’s “interests of justice” standard. But its\ndenial of his motion did not adequately account for all of\nthe factors we set forth in Clair.\n   The court’s principal error was its failure to\nacknowledge Horwitz and Butts’ conflict of interest. Toll-\ning based on counsel’s failure to satisfy AEDPA’s statute\nof limitations is available only for “serious instances of\nattorney misconduct.” Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631,\n651–652 (2010). Advancing such a claim would have\nrequired Horwitz and Butts to denigrate their own per-\nformance. Counsel cannot reasonably be expected to make\nsuch an argument, which threatens their professional\nreputation and livelihood. See Restatement (Third) of\nLaw Governing Lawyers §125 (1998). Thus, as we ob-\nserved in a similar context in Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S.\n___, ___, n. 8 (2012) (slip op., at 17, n. 8), a “significant\nconflict of interest” arises when an attorney’s “interest in\navoiding damage to [his] own reputation” is at odds with\n6                   CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nhis client’s “strongest argument—i.e., that his attorneys\nhad abandoned him.”\n  Indeed, to their credit, Horwitz and Butts acknowledged\nthe nature of their conflict. Shortly before the first motion\nfor substitution was filed, they provided an update to the\nMissouri Supreme Court on the status of Christeson’s\ncollateral proceedings. In it, they stated:\n     “Because counsel herein would be essential witnesses\n     to factual questions indispensable to a Holland in-\n     quiry, there may be ethical and legal conflicts that\n     would arise that would prohibit counsel from litigat-\n     ing issues that would support a Holland claim. Un-\n     waivable ethical and legal conflicts prohibit under-\n     signed counsel from litigating these issues in any way.\n     See Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475, 485–486\n     (1978). Conflict free counsel must be appointed to\n     present the equitable tolling question in federal dis-\n     trict court.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a–49a.\n   Yet, in their response to the District Court’s order to\naddress the substitution motion, Horwitz and Butts char-\nacterized the potential arguments in favor of equitable\ntolling as “ludicrous,” and asserted that they had “a legal\nbasis and rationale for the [erroneous] calculation of the\nfiling date.” Id., at 86a, 90a. While not every case in\nwhich a counseled habeas petitioner has missed AEDPA’s\nstatute of limitations will necessarily involve a conflict of\ninterest, Horwitz and Butts’ contentions here were directly\nand concededly contrary to their client’s interest, and\nmanifestly served their own professional and reputational\ninterests.\n   Clair makes clear that a conflict of this sort is grounds\nfor substitution. Even the narrower standard we rejected\nin that case would have allowed for substitution where an\nattorney has a “ ‘disabling conflict of interest.’ ” 565 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 7). And that standard, we concluded,\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nwould “gu[t]” the specific substitution-of-counsel clause\ncontained in §3559(e), which must contemplate the grant-\ning of such motions in circumstances beyond those where a\npetitioner effectively “has no counsel at all”—as is the case\nwhen counsel is conflicted. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nIndeed, we went so far as to say that given a capital de-\nfendant’s “statutory right to counsel,” even “in the ab-\nsence” of §3599(e) a district court would be compelled “to\nappoint new counsel if the first lawyer developed a con-\nflict.” Ibid.\n   Given the obvious conflict of interest here, the consider-\nations relied upon by the District Court cannot justify its\ndecision to deny petitioner new counsel. The second and\nthird factors noted by the District Court—that appointed\ncounsel continued to represent Christeson in litigation\nchallenging the means of his execution, and that the\nEighth Circuit had not previously substituted counsel—\nare not substantial. Whether Horwitz and Butts had\ncurrently “abandoned” Christeson is beside the point:\nEven if they were actively representing him in some mat-\nters, their conflict prevented them from representing him\nin this particular matter. Likewise, it is irrelevant that\nthe Eighth Circuit had not previously sua sponte directed\nsubstitution of counsel in the course of denying\nChristeson’s request for a certificate of appealabilty and\nadjudicating his challenge to Missouri’s execution protocol,\nwhen the conflict was not evident.\n   The first and fourth factors cited by the District Court—\nthe delay in seeking substitution and the potential for\nabuse—might be valid considerations in many cases. See\nClair, 565 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (“Protecting against\nabusive delay is an interest of justice”). But under the\ncircumstances here, these factors alone cannot warrant\ndenial of substitution. Christeson’s first substitution\nmotion, while undoubtedly delayed, was not abusive. It\nwas filed approximately a month after outside counsel\n8                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nbecame aware of Christeson’s plight and well before the\nState had set an execution date, and it requested only 90\ndays to investigate and file a Rule 60(b) motion.\n  Nor is it plain that any subsequent motion that substi-\ntute counsel might file on Christeson’s behalf would be\nfutile. See id., at ___ – ___ (slip op., at 15–16) (affirming\ndenial of substitution motion as untimely where any filing\nmade by substitute counsel would have been futile). To be\nsure, Christeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to\nhaving a federal court consider his habeas petition. Al-\nthough Christeson might properly raise a claim for relief\npursuant to Rule 60(b), see Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S.\n524, 535–536 (2005), to obtain such relief he must demon-\nstrate both the motion’s timeliness and, more significant\nhere, that “ ‘extraordinary circumstances’ justif[y] the\nreopening of a final judgment.” Id., at 535 (quoting\nAckermann v. United States, 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950)).\nThat, in turn, will require Christeson to show that he was\nentitled to the equitable tolling of AEDPA’s statute of\nlimitations. He should have that opportunity, and is\nentitled to the assistance of substitute counsel in doing so.\n                        *     *    *\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in\nforma pauperis are granted.

Decided January 20, 2015\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   I would not reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals\nin this case without briefing and argument. As the Court\nacknowledges, petitioner cannot obtain review of the\nmerits of his federal habeas claims without showing that\nthe applicable statute of limitations should have been\nequitably tolled, ante, at 2, and the availability of equit-\nable tolling in cases governed by the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) is a question\nof great importance.\n   AEDPA sought to ameliorate the lengthy delay that had\noften characterized federal habeas proceedings in the\npast.* See Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202, 206 (2003)\n(“Congress enacted AEDPA to reduce delays in the execu-\ntion of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in\ncapital cases”). AEDPA thus imposed a strict 1-year time\nlimit for filing a federal habeas petition. 28 U. S. C.\n§2244(d). If this 1-year period were equitably tolled\nwhenever a habeas petitioner’s attorney missed the dead-\nline and thus rendered ineffective assistance, the 1-year\nperiod would be of little value, and the days of seemingly\ninterminable federal habeas review would return. In\n\n——————\n  * Members of this Court have lamented the delay that often occurs in\ncapital cases. Johnson v. Bredesen, 558 U. S. 1067, 1067–1070 (2009)\n(Stevens, J., statement respecting denial of certiorari), Elledge v.\nFlorida, 525 U. S. 944, 944–946 (1998) (BREYER, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari).\n2                  CHRISTESON v. ROPER\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nHolland, the Court held that the AEDPA statute of limita-\ntions may be equitably tolled—but only under quite ex-\ntraordinary circumstances. Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S.\n631, 651–652 (2010). Any expansion or further delinea-\ntion of such circumstances should not be undertaken\nwithout the careful consideration that is possible only\nafter the normal procedure of full briefing and argument.\n   The Court believes that briefing and argument are not\nnecessary in this case, and my understanding of the\nCourt’s decision is that it expresses no view whatsoever on\nthe question whether petitioner may ultimately be entitled\nto equitable tolling. I understand the Court to hold only\nthat conflict-free substitute counsel should have been\nappointed for the purposes of investigating the facts re-\nlated to the issue of equitable tolling and presenting what-\never argument can be mounted in support of a request for\nthat relief.\n   Based on the present record, it is not clear that this case\ninvolves anything other than an error, albeit a serious one,\non the part of the attorneys who represented petitioner at\nthe time when his federal habeas petition was due to be\nfiled. According to those attorneys, they miscalculated the\ndue date and as a result filed the petition after the time\nhad run. They met with petitioner to discuss the habeas\npetition prior to the date on which they say they thought\nthe petition was due but after the date on which it was\nactually due. These facts show nothing more than attor-\nney error and thus fall short of establishing the kind of\nabandonment that is needed for equitable tolling under\nour precedent. See id., at 651–652. I do not understand\nthe Court’s opinion to hold otherwise.\n   Because of the close relationship between the question\nthat the Court decides (the propriety of the District\nCourt’s refusal to appoint substitute counsel) and the\nquestion of petitioner’s entitlement to equitable tolling, I\nthink that plenary review would have been more appro-\n                Cite as: 574 U.
