Argued December 3, 2014—Decided January 21, 2015\nPetitioner, Hana Financial, Inc., and respondent Hana Bank both pro-\n  vide financial services to individuals in the United States. When\n  Hana Financial sued Hana Bank for trademark infringement, Hana\n  Bank invoked in defense the tacking doctrine, under which lower\n  courts have provided that a trademark user may make certain modi-\n  fications to its mark over time while, in limited circumstances, re-\n  taining its priority position. Petitioner’s claim was tried before a ju-\n  ry, and the District Court adopted in substantial part the jury\n  instruction on tacking proposed by petitioner. The jury returned a\n  verdict in respondent’s favor. Affirming, the Ninth Circuit explained\n  that the tacking inquiry was an exceptionally limited and highly fact-\n  sensitive matter reserved for juries, not judges.\nHeld: Whether two trademarks may be tacked for purposes of determin-\n ing priority is a question for the jury. Pp. 3–8.\n    (a) Lower courts have held that two marks may be tacked when\n they are considered to be “legal equivalents,” i.e., they “create the\n same, continuing commercial impression.” Van Dyne-Crotty, Inc. v.\n Wear-Guard Corp. 926 F. 2d 1156, 1159. And “commercial impres-\n sion” “must be viewed through the eyes of a consumer.” DuoProSS\n Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Medical Devices, Ltd., 695 F. 3d 1247, 1253.\n When the relevant question is how an ordinary person or community\n would make an assessment, the jury is generally the decisionmaker\n that ought to provide the fact-intensive answer. See, e.g., United\n States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 512. Pp. 3–5.\n    (b) Each of petitioner’s four arguments in support of its view that\n tacking is a question of law to be resolved by a judge is unpersuasive.\n First, it may be true that the “legal equivalents” test involves a legal\n standard, but such “ ‘mixed question[s] of law and fact,’ [have] typi-\n2               HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v. HANA BANK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cally been resolved by juries.” Gaudin, 515 U. S., at 512. And any\n    concern that a jury may improperly apply the relevant legal standard\n    can be remedied by crafting careful jury instructions. Second, peti-\n    tioner offers no support for its claim that tacking determinations cre-\n    ate new law in a unique way that requires those determinations to be\n    reserved for judges. Third, petitioner worries that the predictability\n    required for a functioning trademark system will be absent if tacking\n    questions are assigned to juries, but offers no reason why trademark\n    tacking should be treated differently from the tort, contract, and\n    criminal justice systems, where juries answer often-dispositive factu-\n    al questions or make dispositive applications of legal standards to\n    facts. Finally, in arguing that judges have historically resolved tack-\n    ing disputes, petitioner points to cases arising in the contexts of\n    bench trials, summary judgment, and the like, in which it is undis-\n    puted that judges may resolve tacking disputes.

HANA \n\n                BANK, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [January 21, 2015]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Rights in a trademark are determined by the date of the\nmark’s first use in commerce. The party who first uses a\nmark in commerce is said to have priority over other\nusers. Recognizing that trademark users ought to be\npermitted to make certain modifications to their marks\nover time without losing priority, lower courts have pro-\nvided that, in limited circumstances, a party may clothe a\nnew mark with the priority position of an older mark.\nThis doctrine is called “tacking,” and lower courts have\nfound tacking to be available when the original and re-\nvised marks are “legal equivalents” in that they create the\nsame, continuing commercial impression. The question\npresented here is whether a judge or a jury should deter-\nmine whether tacking is available in a given case. Be-\ncause the tacking inquiry operates from the perspective of\nan ordinary purchaser or consumer, we hold that a jury\nshould make this determination.\n                            I\n  Petitioner, Hana Financial, and respondent Hana Bank,\na subsidiary of respondent Hana Financial Group, both\n2           HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v. HANA BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovide financial services to individuals in the United\nStates. Hana Bank (hereinafter respondent) was estab-\nlished in 1971 as a Korean entity called Korea Investment\nFinance Corporation. In 1991, that entity changed its\nname to “Hana Bank” and began using this name in Ko-\nrea. In 1994, it established a service called Hana Over-\nseas Korean Club to provide financial services to Korean\nexpatriates, and specifically advertised that service in the\nUnited States. Those advertisements used the name\n“Hana Overseas Korean Club” in both English and Kore-\nan, and included the name “Hana Bank” in Korean and\nrespondent’s “dancing man” logo. See App. 206. In 2000,\nrespondent changed the name of the Hana Overseas Ko-\nrean Club to “Hana World Center.” In 2002, respondent\nbegan operating a bank in the United States under the\nname “Hana Bank.” This enterprise amounted to re-\nspondent’s first physical presence in the United States.\n   Petitioner was established in 1994 as a California corpo-\nration called Hana Financial. It began using that name\nand an associated trademark in commerce in 1995. In\n1996, it obtained a federal trademark registration for a\npyramid logo with the name “Hana Financial” for use in\nconnection with financial services.\n   In 2007, petitioner sued respondent, alleging infringe-\nment of its “Hana Financial” mark. As relevant here,\nrespondent denied infringement by invoking the tacking\ndoctrine and claiming that it had priority. The District\nCourt initially granted summary judgment to respondent\non the infringement claim, but the Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that there were genu-\nine issues of material fact as to priority. On remand, the\ninfringement claim was tried before a jury. The District\nCourt adopted in substantial part the jury instruction\nproposed by petitioner, and, without objection from peti-\ntioner, instructed the jury as follows:\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    “A party may claim priority in a mark based on the\n    first use date of a similar but technically distinct\n    mark where the previously used mark is the legal\n    equivalent of the mark in question or indistinguish-\n    able therefrom such that consumers consider both as\n    the same mark. This is called ‘tacking.’ The marks\n    must create the same, continuing commercial impres-\n    sion, and the later mark should not materially differ\n    from or alter the character of the mark attempted\n    to be tacked.” App. 173; see id., at 140 (proposed\n    instruction).\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of respondent, and the\nDistrict Court denied petitioner’s motion for judgment as a\nmatter of law.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nThe court explained that, although tacking applies only in\n“exceptionally narrow circumstances,” 735 F. 3d 1158,\n1160 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted), it “ ‘re-\nquires a highly fact-sensitive inquiry’ ” that is “reserved for\nthe jury,” ibid. (quoting One Industries, LLC v. Jim O’Neal\nDistributing, Inc., 578 F. 3d 1154, 1160 (CA9 2009)). The\ncourt acknowledged, however, that whether tacking\nshould be decided by juries or judges “is the subject of a\ncircuit split.” 735 F. 3d, at 1164, n. 5 (noting that the\nFederal and Sixth Circuits “evaluate tacking as a question\nof law”); see Van Dyne-Crotty, Inc. v. Wear-Guard Corp.,\n926 F. 2d 1156, 1159 (CA Fed. 1991); Data Concepts, Inc.\nv. Digital Consulting, Inc., 150 F. 3d 620, 623 (CA6 1998).\n   We granted certiorari, 573 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\naffirm.\n                            II\n  As discussed above, the general rule adopted by lower\ncourts has been that two marks may be tacked when the\noriginal and revised marks are “legal equivalents.” This\nterm refers to two marks that “create the same, continuing\n4             HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v. HANA BANK\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncommercial impression” so that consumers “consider both\nas the same mark.”1 Van Dyne-Crotty, Inc., 926 F. 2d, at\n1159 (internal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., George\n& Co., LLC v. Imagination Entertainment Ltd., 575 F. 3d\n383, 402 (CA4 2009); Brookfield Communications, Inc. v.\nWest Coast Entertainment Corp., 174 F. 3d 1036, 1047–\n1048 (CA9 1999); Data Concepts, Inc., 150 F. 3d, at 623.\n“The commercial impression that a mark conveys must be\nviewed through the eyes of a consumer.” DuoProSS Medi-\ntech Corp. v. Inviro Medical Devices, Ltd., 695 F. 3d 1247,\n1253 (CA Fed. 2012); see 3 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and\nUnfair Competition §17:26, p. 17–71 (4th ed. 2014)\n(“ ‘Commercial impression,’ like most issues in trademark\nlaw, should be determined from the perspective of the\nordinary purchaser of these kinds of goods or services”).\n    Application of a test that relies upon an ordinary con-\nsumer’s understanding of the impression that a mark\nconveys falls comfortably within the ken of a jury. Indeed,\nwe have long recognized across a variety of doctrinal\ncontexts that, when the relevant question is how an ordi-\nnary person or community would make an assessment, the\njury is generally the decisionmaker that ought to provide\nthe fact-intensive answer. See, e.g., United States v.\nGaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 512 (1995) (recognizing that “ ‘deli-\ncate assessments of the inferences a ‘reasonable [deci-\nsionmaker]’ would draw . . .

If the facts\nwarrant it, a judge may decide a tacking question on a\nmotion for summary judgment or for judgment as a matter\nof law. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 50, 56(a). And if the\nparties have opted to try their case before a judge, the\njudge may of course decide a tacking question in his or her\nfactfinding capacity. We hold only that, when a jury trial\nhas been requested and when the facts do not warrant\nentry of summary judgment or judgment as a matter of\nlaw, the question whether tacking is warranted must be\ndecided by a jury.\n                              III\n   Attempting to overcome our conclusion, petitioner offers\nfour reasons why, in its view, tacking is a question of law\nthat should be resolved by a judge. None persuades us.\n   Petitioner first observes that the “legal equivalents” test\ninvolves the application of a legal standard. See Brief for\nPetitioner 20. True enough, but “the application-of-legal-\nstandard-to-fact sort of question . . . , commonly called a\n‘mixed question of law and fact,’ has typically been re-\nsolved by juries.” Gaudin, 515 U. S., at 512; see id., at 514\n(“[T]he jury’s constitutional responsibility is not merely to\ndetermine the facts, but to apply the law to those facts and\ndraw the ultimate conclusion . . .”); Miller v. Fenton, 474\nU. S. 104, 113 (1985) (“[A]n issue does not lose its factual\ncharacter merely because its resolution is dispositive of\n6            HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v. HANA BANK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe ultimate . . . question”). The “mixed” analysis that\ntakes place during the tacking inquiry is no different. And\ninsofar as petitioner is concerned that a jury may improp-\nerly apply the relevant legal standard, the solution is to\ncraft careful jury instructions that make that standard\nclear. Here, however, petitioner can hardly criticize the\ninstruction the District Court gave the jury, as it was\nessentially the instruction petitioner proposed.\n   Second, petitioner argues that tacking determinations\nwill “create new law that will guide future tacking dis-\nputes”—a task reserved for judges. Brief for Petitioner 21.\nIt is not at all clear, however, why a tacking determination\nin a particular case will “create new law” any more than\nwill a jury verdict in a tort case, a contract dispute, or a\ncriminal proceeding. Petitioner insists that tacking ques-\ntions “have to be” resolved by comparing two marks in a\ngiven case “against those addressed in other tacking cases,”\nid., at 22, but we do not agree. Of course, in deciding\nsummary judgment motions, or in making rulings in\nbench trials, judges may look to past cases holding that\ntrademark owners either were or were not entitled to\ntacking as a matter of law. But petitioner offers no sup-\nport for the claim that tacking cases “have to be” resolved\nby reliance on precedent. Indeed, in many of the cases\npetitioner cites in support of this argument, the courts in\nquestion relied on precedent only to define the relevant\nlegal standard. See, e.g., Specht v. Google Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2474546\"><a href=\"/opinion/2474546/specht-v-google-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

S. ____ (2015)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Third, and related, petitioner worries that the predict-\nability required for a functioning trademark system will be\nabsent if tacking questions are assigned to juries. See\nBrief for Petitioner 25–27. But, again, the same could be\nsaid about the tort, contract, and criminal justice systems:\nIn all of these areas, juries answer often-dispositive fac-\ntual questions or make dispositive applications of legal\nstandards to facts. The fact that another jury, hearing the\nsame case, might reach a different conclusion may make\nthe system “unpredictable,” but it has never stopped us\nfrom employing juries in these analogous contexts. Peti-\ntioner has offered no reason why trademark tacking ought\nto be treated differently. Moreover, decisionmaking in\nfact-intensive disputes necessarily requires judgment\ncalls. Regardless of whether those judgment calls are\nmade by juries or judges, they necessarily involve some\ndegree of uncertainty, particularly when they have to do\nwith how reasonable persons would behave.\n   Finally, petitioner argues that, as a historical matter,\njudges have resolved tacking disputes. See Brief for Peti-\ntioner 30–35. But petitioner relies on cases in which\njudges have resolved tacking disputes in bench trials, at\nsummary judgment, or the like. See, e.g., Drexel Enter-\nprises, Inc. v. Richardson, 312 F. 2d 525, 526 (CA10 1962)\n(“[This action] was tried without a jury”); Perfectform\nCorp. v.

Sandoz, Inc., ante, at 5. The tacking inquiry, by\ncontrast, involves a factual judgment about whether two marks give the\nsame impression to consumers. Making that kind of judgment is, as\ndiscussed above, not “one of those things that judges often do” better\nthan jurors.\n8          HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v.

Pp. 3–5.\n    (b) Each of petitioner’s four arguments in support of its view that\n tacking is a question of law to be resolved by a judge is unpersuasive.\n First, it may be true that the “legal equivalents” test involves a legal\n standard, but such “ ‘mixed question[s] of law and fact,’ [have] typi-\n2               HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v.

And any\n    concern that a jury may improperly apply the relevant legal standard\n    can be remedied by crafting careful jury instructions. Second, peti-\n    tioner offers no support for its claim that tacking determinations cre-\n    ate new law in a unique way that requires those determinations to be\n    reserved for judges. Third, petitioner worries that the predictability\n    required for a functioning trademark system will be absent if tacking\n    questions are assigned to juries, but offers no reason why trademark\n    tacking should be treated differently from the tort, contract, and\n    criminal justice systems, where juries answer often-dispositive factu-\n    al questions or make dispositive applications of legal standards to\n    facts. Finally, in arguing that judges have historically resolved tack-\n    ing disputes, petitioner points to cases arising in the contexts of\n    bench trials, summary judgment, and the like, in which it is undis-\n    puted that judges may resolve tacking disputes.

The party who first uses a\nmark in commerce is said to have priority over other\nusers. Recognizing that trademark users ought to be\npermitted to make certain modifications to their marks\nover time without losing priority, lower courts have pro-\nvided that, in limited circumstances, a party may clothe a\nnew mark with the priority position of an older mark.\nThis doctrine is called “tacking,” and lower courts have\nfound tacking to be available when the original and re-\nvised marks are “legal equivalents” in that they create the\nsame, continuing commercial impression. The question\npresented here is whether a judge or a jury should deter-\nmine whether tacking is available in a given case. Be-\ncause the tacking inquiry operates from the perspective of\nan ordinary purchaser or consumer, we hold that a jury\nshould make this determination.\n                            I\n  Petitioner, Hana Financial, and respondent Hana Bank,\na subsidiary of respondent Hana Financial Group, both\n2           HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v. HANA BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovide financial services to individuals in the United\nStates. Hana Bank (hereinafter respondent) was estab-\nlished in 1971 as a Korean entity called Korea Investment\nFinance Corporation. In 1991, that entity changed its\nname to “Hana Bank” and began using this name in Ko-\nrea. In 1994, it established a service called Hana Over-\nseas Korean Club to provide financial services to Korean\nexpatriates, and specifically advertised that service in the\nUnited States. Those advertisements used the name\n“Hana Overseas Korean Club” in both English and Kore-\nan, and included the name “Hana Bank” in Korean and\nrespondent’s “dancing man” logo. See App. 206. In 2000,\nrespondent changed the name of the Hana Overseas Ko-\nrean Club to “Hana World Center.” In 2002, respondent\nbegan operating a bank in the United States under the\nname “Hana Bank.” This enterprise amounted to re-\nspondent’s first physical presence in the United States.\n   Petitioner was established in 1994 as a California corpo-\nration called Hana Financial. It began using that name\nand an associated trademark in commerce in 1995. In\n1996, it obtained a federal trademark registration for a\npyramid logo with the name “Hana Financial” for use in\nconnection with financial services.\n   In 2007, petitioner sued respondent, alleging infringe-\nment of its “Hana Financial” mark. As relevant here,\nrespondent denied infringement by invoking the tacking\ndoctrine and claiming that it had priority. The District\nCourt initially granted summary judgment to respondent\non the infringement claim, but the Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that there were genu-\nine issues of material fact as to priority. On remand, the\ninfringement claim was tried before a jury. The District\nCourt adopted in substantial part the jury instruction\nproposed by petitioner, and, without objection from peti-\ntioner, instructed the jury as follows:\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    “A party may claim priority in a mark based on the\n    first use date of a similar but technically distinct\n    mark where the previously used mark is the legal\n    equivalent of the mark in question or indistinguish-\n    able therefrom such that consumers consider both as\n    the same mark. This is called ‘tacking.’ The marks\n    must create the same, continuing commercial impres-\n    sion, and the later mark should not materially differ\n    from or alter the character of the mark attempted\n    to be tacked.” App. 173; see id., at 140 (proposed\n    instruction).\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of respondent, and the\nDistrict Court denied petitioner’s motion for judgment as a\nmatter of law.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nThe court explained that, although tacking applies only in\n“exceptionally narrow circumstances,” 735 F. 3d 1158,\n1160 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted), it “ ‘re-\nquires a highly fact-sensitive inquiry’ ” that is “reserved for\nthe jury,” ibid. (quoting One Industries, LLC v. Jim O’Neal\nDistributing, Inc., 578 F. 3d 1154, 1160 (CA9 2009)). The\ncourt acknowledged, however, that whether tacking\nshould be decided by juries or judges “is the subject of a\ncircuit split.” 735 F. 3d, at 1164, n. 5 (noting that the\nFederal and Sixth Circuits “evaluate tacking as a question\nof law”); see Van Dyne-Crotty, Inc. v. Wear-Guard Corp.,\n926 F. 2d 1156, 1159 (CA Fed. 1991); Data Concepts, Inc.\nv. Digital Consulting, Inc., 150 F. 3d 620, 623 (CA6 1998).\n   We granted certiorari, 573 U.

Indeed,\nwe have long recognized across a variety of doctrinal\ncontexts that, when the relevant question is how an ordi-\nnary person or community would make an assessment, the\njury is generally the decisionmaker that ought to provide\nthe fact-intensive answer. See, e.g., United States v.\nGaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 512 (1995) (recognizing that “ ‘deli-\ncate assessments of the inferences a ‘reasonable [deci-\nsionmaker]’ would draw . . .

If the facts\nwarrant it, a judge may decide a tacking question on a\nmotion for summary judgment or for judgment as a matter\nof law. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 50, 56(a). And if the\nparties have opted to try their case before a judge, the\njudge may of course decide a tacking question in his or her\nfactfinding capacity. We hold only that, when a jury trial\nhas been requested and when the facts do not warrant\nentry of summary judgment or judgment as a matter of\nlaw, the question whether tacking is warranted must be\ndecided by a jury.\n                              III\n   Attempting to overcome our conclusion, petitioner offers\nfour reasons why, in its view, tacking is a question of law\nthat should be resolved by a judge. None persuades us.\n   Petitioner first observes that the “legal equivalents” test\ninvolves the application of a legal standard. See Brief for\nPetitioner 20. True enough, but “the application-of-legal-\nstandard-to-fact sort of question . . . , commonly called a\n‘mixed question of law and fact,’ has typically been re-\nsolved by juries.” Gaudin, 515 U. S., at 512; see id., at 514\n(“[T]he jury’s constitutional responsibility is not merely to\ndetermine the facts, but to apply the law to those facts and\ndraw the ultimate conclusion . . .”); Miller v. Fenton, 474\nU. S. 104, 113 (1985) (“[A]n issue does not lose its factual\ncharacter merely because its resolution is dispositive of\n6            HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v. HANA BANK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe ultimate . . . question”). The “mixed” analysis that\ntakes place during the tacking inquiry is no different. And\ninsofar as petitioner is concerned that a jury may improp-\nerly apply the relevant legal standard, the solution is to\ncraft careful jury instructions that make that standard\nclear. Here, however, petitioner can hardly criticize the\ninstruction the District Court gave the jury, as it was\nessentially the instruction petitioner proposed.\n   Second, petitioner argues that tacking determinations\nwill “create new law that will guide future tacking dis-\nputes”—a task reserved for judges. Brief for Petitioner 21.\nIt is not at all clear, however, why a tacking determination\nin a particular case will “create new law” any more than\nwill a jury verdict in a tort case, a contract dispute, or a\ncriminal proceeding. Petitioner insists that tacking ques-\ntions “have to be” resolved by comparing two marks in a\ngiven case “against those addressed in other tacking cases,”\nid., at 22, but we do not agree. Of course, in deciding\nsummary judgment motions, or in making rulings in\nbench trials, judges may look to past cases holding that\ntrademark owners either were or were not entitled to\ntacking as a matter of law. But petitioner offers no sup-\nport for the claim that tacking cases “have to be” resolved\nby reliance on precedent. Indeed, in many of the cases\npetitioner cites in support of this argument, the courts in\nquestion relied on precedent only to define the relevant\nlegal standard. See, e.g., Specht v. Google Inc., 758\nF. Supp. 2d 570, 583–585 (ND Ill. 2010), aff ’d, 747 F. 3d\n929 (CA7 2014); Children’s Legal Servs. PLLC v. Kresch,\n2008 WL 1901245, *1–*2 (ED Mich., Apr. 25, 2008), aff ’d\nsub nom. Children’s Legal Servs., P. L. L. C. v. Saiontz,\nKirk & Miles, P. A., 2009 WL 1868809 (CA6, June 18,\n2009).2\n——————\n  2 Our decision in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S.\n\n370 (1996), is not to the contrary. In Markman, we held that the task\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Third, and related, petitioner worries that the predict-\nability required for a functioning trademark system will be\nabsent if tacking questions are assigned to juries. See\nBrief for Petitioner 25–27. But, again, the same could be\nsaid about the tort, contract, and criminal justice systems:\nIn all of these areas, juries answer often-dispositive fac-\ntual questions or make dispositive applications of legal\nstandards to facts. The fact that another jury, hearing the\nsame case, might reach a different conclusion may make\nthe system “unpredictable,” but it has never stopped us\nfrom employing juries in these analogous contexts. Peti-\ntioner has offered no reason why trademark tacking ought\nto be treated differently. Moreover, decisionmaking in\nfact-intensive disputes necessarily requires judgment\ncalls. Regardless of whether those judgment calls are\nmade by juries or judges, they necessarily involve some\ndegree of uncertainty, particularly when they have to do\nwith how reasonable persons would behave.\n   Finally, petitioner argues that, as a historical matter,\njudges have resolved tacking disputes. See Brief for Peti-\ntioner 30–35. But petitioner relies on cases in which\njudges have resolved tacking disputes in bench trials, at\nsummary judgment, or the like. See, e.g., Drexel Enter-\nprises, Inc. v. Richardson, 312 F. 2d 525, 526 (CA10 1962)\n(“[This action] was tried without a jury”); Perfectform\nCorp. v. Perfect Brassiere Co., 256 F. 2d 736, 738 (CA3\n1958) (“The district court dismissed the complaint”); John\n\n——————\nof construing patent terms falls to judges and not to juries. We held as\nmuch because “[t]he construction of written instruments is one of those\nthings that judges often do and are likely to do better than jurors\nunburdened by training in exegesis.” Id., at 388; see Teva Pharmaceu-\nticals USA, Inc., v. Sandoz, Inc., ante, at 5. The tacking inquiry, by\ncontrast, involves a factual judgment about whether two marks give the\nsame impression to consumers. Making that kind of judgment is, as\ndiscussed above, not “one of those things that judges often do” better\nthan jurors.\n8          HANA FINANCIAL, INC. v. HANA BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMorrell & Co. v.

Lorillard Co., 299 F. 834, 835 (NJ 1924)\n(equitable claims tried solely before a judge). As we have\nnoted, it is undisputed that judges may resolve tacking\ndisputes in those contexts. But recognizing as much does\nnot gainsay our conclusion that, when a jury is to be em-\npaneled and when the facts warrant neither summary\njudgment nor judgment as a matter of law, tacking is a\nquestion for the jury.\n                         *   *   *\n  The Ninth Circuit correctly held that whether two\nmarks may be tacked for purposes of determining priority\nis a question for the jury.
