Argued November 4, 2014—Decided January 21, 2015\nIn 2002, Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act, 116 Stat. 2135.\n  That Act provides that the Transportation Security Administration\n  (TSA) “shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of infor-\n  mation . . . if the Under Secretary decides that disclosur[e] would . . .\n  be detrimental to the security of transportation.”         49 U. S. C.\n  §114(r)(1)(C). Around the same time, the TSA promulgated regula-\n  tions prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of “sensitive security in-\n  formation,” 67 Fed. Reg. 8351, which included “[s]pecific details of\n  aviation security measures . . . [such as] information concerning spe-\n  cific numbers of Federal Air Marshals, deployments or missions, and\n  the methods involved in such operations,” 49 CFR §1520.7(j).\n     In July 2003, the TSA briefed all federal air marshals—including\n  Robert J. MacLean—about a potential plot to hijack passenger\n  flights. A few days after the briefing, MacLean received from the\n  TSA a text message cancelling all overnight missions from Las Vegas\n  until early August. MacLean, who was stationed in Las Vegas, be-\n  lieved that cancelling those missions during a hijacking alert was\n  dangerous and illegal. He therefore contacted a reporter and told\n  him about the TSA’s decision to cancel the missions. After discover-\n  ing that MacLean was the source of the disclosure, the TSA fired him\n  for disclosing sensitive security information without authorization.\n     MacLean challenged his firing before the Merit Systems Protection\n  Board. He argued that his disclosure was whistleblowing activity\n  under 5 U. S. C. §2302(b)(8)(A), which protects employees who dis-\n  close information that reveals “any violation of any law, rule, or regu-\n  lation,” or “a substantial and specific danger to public health or safe-\n  ty.” The Board held that MacLean did not qualify for protection\n2      DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    under that statute because his disclosure was “specifically prohibited\n    by law,” §2302(b)(8)(A)—namely, by 49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1). The Court\n    of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the Board’s decision, hold-\n    ing that Section 114(r)(1) was not a prohibition.\nHeld: MacLean’s disclosure was not “specifically prohibited by law.”\n Pp. 5–16.\n    (a) The Government argues that MacLean’s disclosure was “specifi-\n cally prohibited by law” in two ways: first, by the TSA’s regulations\n on sensitive security information, and second, by Section 114(r)(1) it-\n self, which authorized the TSA to promulgate those regulations.\n Pp. 5–14.\n      (i) MacLean’s disclosure was not prohibited by the TSA’s regula-\n tions for purposes of Section 2302(b)(8)(A) because regulations do not\n qualify as “law” under that statute. Throughout Section 2302, Con-\n gress repeatedly used the phrase “law, rule, or regulation.” But Con-\n gress did not use that phrase in the statutory language at issue here;\n it used the word “law” standing alone. Congress’s choice to say “spe-\n cifically prohibited by law,” instead of “specifically prohibited by law,\n rule, or regulation” suggests that Congress meant to exclude rules\n and regulations. In addition, Section 2302(b)(8)(A) creates a second\n exception for disclosures “required by Executive order to be kept se-\n cret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign af-\n fairs.” That the second exception is limited to actions by the Presi-\n dent himself suggests that the first exception does not include action\n taken by executive agencies. Finally, interpreting the word “law” to\n include rules and regulations could defeat the purpose of the whistle-\n blower statute. That interpretation would allow an agency to insu-\n late itself from Section 2302(b)(8)(A) simply by promulgating a regu-\n lation that “specifically prohibited” all whistleblowing.\n    The Government proposes two alternative interpretations, but nei-\n ther is persuasive. First, the Government argues that the word “law”\n includes all regulations that have the “force and effect of law.” The\n Government bases this argument on the decision in Chrysler Corp. v.\n Brown, 441 U. S. 281, where this Court held that legislative regula-\n tions generally fall within the meaning of the word “law” unless there\n is a “clear showing of contrary legislative intent.” Id., at 295–296.\n But Congress’s use of the word “law,” in close connection with the\n phrase “law, rule, or regulation,” provides the necessary “clear show-\n ing” that “law” does not include regulations in this case. Second, the\n Government argues that the word “law” includes at least those regu-\n lations that were “promulgated pursuant to an express congressional\n directive.” The Government, however, was unable to find a single ex-\n ample of the word “law” being used in that way. Pp. 6–11.\n      (ii) Likewise, MacLean’s disclosure was not prohibited by Section\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  114(r)(1). That statute does not prohibit anything; instead, it author-\n  izes the TSA to “prescribe regulations.” Thus, by its terms, Section\n  114(r)(1) did not prohibit the disclosure here. The Government re-\n  sponds that Section 114(r)(1) did prohibit MacLean’s disclosure by\n  imposing a “legislative mandate” on the TSA to promulgate regula-\n  tions to that effect. But the statute affords substantial discretion to\n  the TSA in deciding whether to prohibit any particular disclosure.\n  Thus, it is the TSA’s regulations—not the statute—that prohibited\n  MacLean’s disclosure, and those regulations do not qualify as “law”\n  under Section 2302(b)(8)(A). Pp. 11–14.\n     (b) The Government argues that providing whistleblower protec-\n  tion to individuals like MacLean would “gravely endanger public\n  safety” by making the confidentiality of sensitive security infor-\n  mation depend on the idiosyncratic judgment of each of the TSA’s\n  60,000 employees. Those concerns are legitimate, but they must be\n  addressed by Congress or the President, rather than by this Court.\n  Pp. 14–15.\n714 F. 3d. 1301, affirmed.\n\n  ROBERTS, C.

ROBERT J. MACLEAN \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 21, 2015]\n\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   Federal law generally provides whistleblower protec-\ntions to an employee who discloses information revealing\n“any violation of any law, rule, or regulation,” or “a sub-\nstantial and specific danger to public health or safety.” 5\nU. S. C. §2302(b)(8)(A). An exception exists, however, for\ndisclosures that are “specifically prohibited by law.” Ibid.\nHere, a federal air marshal publicly disclosed that the\nTransportation Security Administration (TSA) had de-\ncided to cut costs by removing air marshals from certain\nlong-distance flights. The question presented is whether\nthat disclosure was “specifically prohibited by law.”\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  In 2002, Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act,\n116 Stat. 2135. As relevant here, that Act provides that\nthe TSA “shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the dis-\nclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying\nout security . . . if the Under Secretary decides that dis-\nclosing the information would . . . be detrimental to the\n2    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsecurity of transportation.” 49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1)(C).\n   Around the same time, the TSA promulgated regula-\ntions prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of what it\ncalled “sensitive security information.” See 67 Fed. Reg.\n8351 (2002). The regulations described 18 categories of\nsensitive security information, including “[s]pecific details\nof aviation security measures . . . [such as] information\nconcerning specific numbers of Federal Air Marshals,\ndeployments or missions, and the methods involved in\nsuch operations.” 49 CFR §1520.7(j) (2002). Sensitive\nsecurity information is not classified, so the TSA can share\nit with individuals who do not have a security clearance,\nsuch as airport employees. Compare Exec. Order 13526,\n§4.1, 3 CFR 298, 314–315 (2009 Comp.), with 49 CFR\n§1520.11(c) (2013).\n                                B\n  Robert J. MacLean became a federal air marshal for the\nTSA in 2001. In that role, MacLean was assigned to pro-\ntect passenger flights from potential hijackings. See 49\nU. S. C. §44917(a).\n  On July 26, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security\n(DHS) issued a confidential advisory about a potential\nhijacking plot. The advisory said that members of the\nterrorist group al Qaeda were planning to attack passen-\nger flights, and that they “considered suicide hijackings\nand bombings as the most promising methods to destroy\naircraft in flight, as well as to strike ground targets.” App.\n16. The advisory identified a number of potential targets,\nincluding the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, and the\neast coast of the United States. Finally, the advisory\nwarned that at least one of the attacks “could be executed\nby the end of the summer 2003.” Ibid.\n  The TSA soon summoned all air marshals (including\nMacLean) for face-to-face briefings about the hijacking\nplot. During MacLean’s briefing, a TSA official told him\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the hijackers were planning to “smuggle weapons in\ncamera equipment or children’s toys through foreign\nsecurity,” and then “fly into the United States . . . into an\nairport that didn’t require them to be screened.” Id., at 92.\nThe hijackers would then board U. S. flights, “overpower\nthe crew or the Air Marshals and . . . fly the planes into\nEast Coast targets.” Id., at 93.\n   A few days after the briefing, MacLean received from\nthe TSA a text message cancelling all overnight missions\nfrom Las Vegas until early August. MacLean, who was\nstationed in Las Vegas, believed that cancelling those\nmissions during a hijacking alert was dangerous. He also\nbelieved that the cancellations were illegal, given that\nfederal law required the TSA to put an air marshal on\nevery flight that “present[s] high security risks,” 49\nU. S. C. §44917(a)(2), and provided that “nonstop, long\ndistance flights, such as those targeted on September 11,\n2001, should be a priority,” §44917(b). See App. 95, 99,\n101.\n   MacLean therefore asked a supervisor why the TSA had\ncanceled the missions. The supervisor responded that the\nTSA wanted “to save money on hotel costs because there\nwas no more money in the budget.” Id., at 95. MacLean\nalso called the DHS Inspector General’s Office to report\nthe cancellations. But a special agent in that office told\nhim there was “nothing that could be done.” Id., at 97.\n   Unwilling to accept those responses, MacLean contacted\nan MSNBC reporter and told him about the canceled\nmissions. In turn, the reporter published a story about\nthe TSA’s decision, titled “Air Marshals pulled from key\nflights.” Id., at 36. The story reported that air marshals\nwould “no longer be covering cross-country or international\nflights” because the agency did not want them “to incur\nthe expense of staying overnight in hotels.” Ibid. The\nstory also reported that the cancellations were “particularly\ndisturbing to some” because they “coincide[d] with a\n4     DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnew high-level hijacking threat issued by the Department\nof Homeland Security.” Id., at 37.\n   After MSNBC published the story, several Members of\nCongress criticized the cancellations. Within 24 hours, the\nTSA reversed its decision and put air marshals back on\nthe flights. Id., at 50.\n   At first, the TSA did not know that MacLean was the\nsource of the disclosure. In September 2004, however,\nMacLean appeared on NBC Nightly News to criticize the\nTSA’s dress code for air marshals, which he believed made\nthem too easy to identify. Although MacLean appeared in\ndisguise, several co-workers recognized his voice, and the\nTSA began investigating the appearance. During that\ninvestigation, MacLean admitted that he had disclosed the\ntext message back in 2003. Consequently, in April 2006,\nthe TSA fired MacLean for disclosing sensitive security\ninformation without authorization.\n   MacLean challenged his firing before the Merit Systems\nProtection Board, arguing in relevant part that his disclo-\nsure was protected whistleblowing activity under 5\nU. S. C. §2302(b)(8)(A). The Board held that MacLean did\nnot qualify for protection under that statute, however,\nbecause his disclosure was “specifically prohibited by law.”\n116 MSPR 562, 569–572 (2011).\n   The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the\nBoard’s decision. 714 F. 3d 1301 (2013). The parties had\nagreed that, in order for MacLean’s disclosure to be “spe-\ncifically prohibited by law,” it must have been “prohibited\nby a statute rather than by a regulation.” Id., at 1308\n(emphasis added). Thus, the issue before the court was\nwhether the statute authorizing the TSA’s regulations—\nnow codified at 49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1)—“specifically prohib-\nited” MacLean’s disclosure. 714 F. 3d, at 1308.*\n——————\n  * This statute has a complicated history. It was codified at 49 U. S. C.\n§40119(b)(1) when the TSA initially promulgated its regulations on\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   The court first held that Section 114(r)(1) was not a\nprohibition. The statute did “not expressly prohibit em-\nployee disclosures,” the court explained, but instead em-\npowered the TSA to “prescribe regulations prohibiting\ndisclosure[s]” if the TSA decided that disclosing the infor-\nmation would harm public safety. Id., at 1309. The court\ntherefore concluded that MacLean’s disclosure was prohib-\nited by a regulation, which the parties had agreed could\nnot be a “law” under Section 2302(b)(8)(A). Ibid.\n   The court then held that, even if Section 114(r)(1) were\na prohibition, it was not “sufficiently specific.” Ibid. The\ncourt explained that a law is sufficiently specific only if it\n“requires that matters be withheld from the public as to\nleave no discretion on the issue, or . . . establishes particu-\nlar criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of\nmatters to be withheld.” Ibid. (quoting S. Rep. No. 95–969\n(1978)). And Section 114(r)(1) did not meet that test\nbecause it “provide[d] only general criteria for withholding\ninformation and [gave] some discretion to the [TSA] to\nfashion regulations for prohibiting disclosure.” 714 F. 3d,\nat 1309. The court accordingly vacated the Board’s deci-\nsion and remanded for a determination of whether Mac-\nLean’s disclosure met the other requirements under Sec-\ntion 2302(b)(8)(A). Id., at 1310–1311.\n   We granted certiorari. 572 U. S. ___ (2014).\n                            II\n  Section 2302(b)(8) provides, in relevant part, that a\nfederal agency may not take\n     “a personnel action with respect to any employee or\n     applicant for employment because of\n——————\nsensitive security information. It was codified at §114(s)(1) when\nMacLean disclosed the text message to MSNBC. And it is now codified\nat §114(r)(1). The Federal Circuit referred to §40119(b)(1) in its opin-\nion. Because the statute has remained identical in all relevant re-\nspects, however, we and the parties refer to the current version.\n6    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    “(A) any disclosure of information by an employee or\n    applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably\n    believes evidences\n    “(i) any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or\n    “(ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an\n    abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific dan-\n    ger to public health or safety,\n    “if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law\n    and if such information is not specifically required by\n    Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of na-\n    tional defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.”\n   The Government argues that this whistleblower statute\ndoes not protect MacLean because his disclosure regarding\nthe canceled missions was “specifically prohibited by law”\nin two ways. First, the Government argues that the dis-\nclosure was specifically prohibited by the TSA’s regula-\ntions on sensitive security information: 49 CFR\n§§1520.5(a)–(b), 1520.7(j) (2003). Second, the Government\nargues that the disclosure was specifically prohibited by\n49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1), which authorized the TSA to pro-\nmulgate those regulations. We address each argument in\nturn.\n                                A\n                                 1\n   In 2003, the TSA’s regulations prohibited the disclosure\nof “[s]pecific details of aviation security measures . . . [such\nas] information concerning specific numbers of Federal Air\nMarshals, deployments or missions, and the methods\ninvolved in such operations.” 49 CFR §1520.7(j). Mac-\nLean does not dispute before this Court that the TSA’s\nregulations prohibited his disclosure regarding the can-\nceled missions. Thus, the question here is whether a\ndisclosure that is specifically prohibited by regulation is\nalso “specifically prohibited by law” under Section\n2302(b)(8)(A). (Emphasis added.)\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The answer is no. Throughout Section 2302, Congress\nrepeatedly used the phrase “law, rule, or regulation.” For\nexample, Section 2302(b)(1)(E) prohibits a federal agency\nfrom discriminating against an employee “on the basis of\nmarital status or political affiliation, as prohibited under\nany law, rule, or regulation.” For another example, Sec-\ntion 2302(b)(6) prohibits an agency from “grant[ing] any\npreference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or\nregulation.” And for a third example, Section 2302(b)\n(9)(A) prohibits an agency from retaliating against an\nemployee for “the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or\ngrievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation.”\n   In contrast, Congress did not use the phrase “law, rule,\nor regulation” in the statutory language at issue here; it\nused the word “law” standing alone. That is significant\nbecause Congress generally acts intentionally when it uses\nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it\nin another. Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23\n(1983). Thus, Congress’s choice to say “specifically prohib-\nited by law” rather than “specifically prohibited by law,\nrule, or regulation” suggests that Congress meant to ex-\nclude rules and regulations.\n   The interpretive canon that Congress acts intentionally\nwhen it omits language included elsewhere applies with\nparticular force here for two reasons. First, Congress used\n“law” and “law, rule, or regulation” in close proximity—\nindeed, in the same sentence. §2302(b)(8)(A) (protecting\nthe disclosure of “any violation of any law, rule, or regula-\ntion . . . if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by\nlaw”). Second, Congress used the broader phrase “law,\nrule, or regulation” repeatedly—nine times in Section 2302\nalone. See §§2302(a)(2)(D)(i), (b)(1)(E), (b)(6), (b)(8)(A)(i),\n(b)(8)(B)(i), (b)(9)(A), (b)(12), (b)(13), (d)(5). Those two\naspects of the whistleblower statute make Con-\ngress’s choice to use the narrower word “law” seem quite\ndeliberate.\n8    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We drew the same inference in Department of Treasury,\nIRS v. FLRA, 494 U. S. 922 (1990). There, the Govern-\nment argued that the word “laws” in one section of the\nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 meant the same thing as\nthe phrase “law, rule, or regulation” in another section of\nthe Act. Id., at 931. We rejected that argument as “sim-\nply contrary to any reasonable interpretation of the text.”\nId., at 932. Indeed, we held that a statute that referred to\n“laws” in one section and “law, rule, or regulation” in\nanother “cannot, unless we abandon all pretense at precise\ncommunication, be deemed to mean the same thing in\nboth places.” Ibid. That inference is even more compel-\nling here, because the statute refers to “law” and “law,\nrule, or regulation” in the same sentence, rather than\nseveral sections apart.\n   Another part of the statutory text points the same way.\nAfter creating an exception for disclosures “specifically\nprohibited by law,” Section 2302(b)(8)(A) goes on to create\na second exception for information “specifically required\nby Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of\nnational defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.” This\nexception is limited to action taken directly by the Presi-\ndent. That suggests that the word “law” in the only other\nexception is limited to actions by Congress—after all, it\nwould be unusual for the first exception to include action\ntaken by executive agencies, when the second exception\nrequires action by the President himself.\n   In addition, a broad interpretation of the word “law”\ncould defeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute. If\n“law” included agency rules and regulations, then an\nagency could insulate itself from the scope of Section\n2302(b)(8)(A) merely by promulgating a regulation that\n“specifically prohibited” whistleblowing. But Congress\npassed the whistleblower statute precisely because it did\nnot trust agencies to regulate whistleblowers within their\nranks.

S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrules and regulations within the word “law.”\n                               2\n  The Government admits that some regulations fall\noutside the word “law” as used in Section 2302(b)(8)(A).\nBut, the Government says, that does not mean that all\nregulations are excluded. The Government suggests two\ninterpretations that would distinguish “law” from “law,\nrule, or regulation,” but would still allow the word “law”\nto subsume the TSA’s regulations on sensitive security\ninformation.\n  First, the Government argues that the word “law” in-\ncludes all regulations that have the “force and effect of\nlaw” (i.e., legislative regulations), while excluding those\nthat do not (e.g., interpretive rules). Brief for Petitioner\n19–22. The Government bases this argument on our\ndecision in Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281 (1979).\nThere, we held that legislative regulations generally fall\nwithin the meaning of the word “law,” and that it would\ntake a “clear showing of contrary legislative intent” before\nwe concluded otherwise. Id., at 295–296. Thus, because\nthe TSA’s regulations have the force and effect of law, the\nGovernment says that they should qualify as “law” under\nthe statute.\n  The Government’s description of Chrysler is accurate\nenough. But Congress’s use of the word “law,” in close\nconnection with the phrase “law, rule, or regulation,”\nprovides the necessary “clear showing” that “law” does not\ninclude regulations. Indeed, using “law” and “law, rule, or\nregulation” in the same sentence would be a very obscure\nway of drawing the Government’s nuanced distinction\nbetween different types of regulations. Had Congress\nwanted to draw that distinction, there were far easier and\nclearer ways to do so. For example, at the time Congress\npassed Section 2302(b)(8)(A), another federal statute\ndefined the words “regulatory order” to include a “rule or\n10   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nregulation, if it has the force and effect of law.” 7 U. S. C.\n§450c(a) (1976 ed.). Likewise, another federal statute\ndefined the words “State law” to include “all laws, deci-\nsions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the\neffect of law.” 29 U. S. C. §1144(c)(1) (1976 ed.). As those\nexamples show, Congress knew how to distinguish be-\ntween regulations that had the force and effect of law and\nthose that did not, but chose not to do so in Section\n2302(b)(8)(A).\n   Second, the Government argues that the word “law”\nincludes at least those regulations that were “promulgated\npursuant to an express congressional directive.” Brief for\nPetitioner 21. Outside of this case, however, the Govern-\nment was unable to find a single example of the word\n“law” being used in that way. Not a single dictionary\ndefinition, not a single statute, not a single case. The\nGovernment’s interpretation happens to fit this case pre-\ncisely, but it needs more than that to recommend it.\n   Although the Government argues here that the word\n“law” includes rules and regulations, it definitively re-\njected that argument in the Court of Appeals. For exam-\nple, the Government’s brief accepted that the word “law”\nmeant “legislative enactment,” and said that the “only\ndispute” was whether 49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1) “serve[d] as\nthat legislative enactment.” Brief for Respondent in No.\n11–3231 (CA Fed.), pp. 46–47. Then, at oral argument, a\njudge asked the Government’s attorney the following\nquestion: “I thought I understood your brief to concede\nthat [the word “law”] can’t be a rule or regulation, it\nmeans statute. Am I wrong?” The Government’s attorney\nresponded: “You’re not wrong your honor. I’ll be as clear\nas I can. ‘Specifically prohibited by law’ here means stat-\nute.” Oral Arg. Audio in No. 11–3231, at 22:42–23:03; see\nalso id., at 29:57–30:03 (“Now, as we’ve been discussing\nhere, we’re not saying here that [the word “law”] needs to\nencompass regulations. We’re saying statute.”). Those\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconcessions reinforce our conclusion that the Govern-\nment’s proposed interpretations are unpersuasive.\n  In sum, when Congress used the phrase “specifically\nprohibited by law” instead of “specifically prohibited by\nlaw, rule, or regulation,” it meant to exclude rules and\nregulations. We therefore hold that the TSA’s regulations\ndo not qualify as “law” for purposes of Section\n2302(b)(8)(A).\n                                B\n   We next consider whether MacLean’s disclosure regard-\ning the canceled missions was “specifically prohibited” by\n49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1) itself. As relevant here, that statute\nprovides that the TSA “shall prescribe regulations prohib-\niting the disclosure of information obtained or developed\nin carrying out security . . . if the Under Secretary decides\nthat disclosing the information would . . . be detrimental\nto the security of transportation.” §114(r)(1)(C).\n   This statute does not prohibit anything. On the con-\ntrary, it authorizes something—it authorizes the Under\nSecretary to “prescribe regulations.” Thus, by its terms\nSection 114(r)(1) did not prohibit the disclosure at issue\nhere.\n   The Government responds that Section 114(r)(1) did\nprohibit MacLean’s disclosure by imposing a “legislative\nmandate” on the TSA to promulgate regulations to that\neffect. See Brief for Petitioner 28, 33; see also post, at 2–3\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). But the Government pushes\nthe statute too far. Section 114(r)(1) says that the TSA\nshall prohibit disclosures only “if the Under Secretary\ndecides that disclosing the information would . . . be det-\nrimental to the security of transportation.” §114(r)(1)(C)\n(emphasis added). That language affords substantial\ndiscretion to the TSA in deciding whether to prohibit any\nparticular disclosure.\n   The dissent tries to downplay the scope of that discre-\n12   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion, viewing it as the almost ministerial task of “identify-\ning whether a particular piece of information falls within\nthe scope of Congress’ command.” Post, at 3. But deter-\nmining which documents meet the statutory standard of\n“detrimental to the security of transportation” requires the\nexercise of considerable judgment. For example, the Gov-\nernment says that Section 114(r)(1) requires the Under\nSecretary to prohibit disclosures like MacLean’s. The\nGovernment also says, however, that the statute does not\nrequire the Under Secretary to prohibit an employee from\ndisclosing that “federal air marshals will be absent from\nimportant flights, but declining to specify which flights.”\nReply Brief 23. That fine-grained distinction comes not\nfrom Section 114(r)(1) itself, but from the Under Secre-\ntary’s exercise of discretion. It is the TSA’s regulations—\nnot the statute—that prohibited MacLean’s disclosure.\nAnd as the dissent agrees, a regulation does not count as\n“law” under the whistleblower statute. See post, at 1.\n   The Government insists, however, that this grant of\ndiscretion does not make Section 114(r)(1) any less of a\nprohibition. In support, the Government relies on Admin-\nistrator, FAA v. Robertson, 422 U. S. 255 (1975). That\ncase involved the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),\nwhich requires federal agencies to disclose information\nupon request unless, among other things, the information\nis “specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.” 5\nU. S. C. §552(b)(3). In Robertson, we held that the Federal\nAviation Act of 1958 was one such statute, because it gave\nthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) “a broad de-\ngree of discretion” in deciding whether to disclose or with-\nhold information. 422 U. S., at 266.\n   The Government tries to analogize that case to this one.\nIn Robertson, the Government says, the FAA’s discretion\nwhether to disclose information did not preclude a finding\nthat the information was “specifically exempted” from\ndisclosure by statute. So too here, the Government says,\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe TSA’s discretion whether to prohibit disclosure of\ninformation does not preclude a finding that the infor-\nmation is “specifically prohibited” from disclosure by\nSection 114(r)(1). See Brief for Petitioner 30.\n   This analogy fails. FOIA and Section 2302(b)(8)(A)\ndiffer in an important way: The provision of FOIA at issue\ninvolves information that is “exempted” from disclosure,\nwhile Section 2302(b)(8)(A) involves information that is\n“prohibited” from disclosure.\n   A statute that exempts information from mandatory\ndisclosure may nonetheless give the agency discretion to\nrelease that exempt information to the public. In such a\ncase, the agency’s exercise of discretion has no effect on\nwhether the information is “exempted from disclosure by\nstatute”—it remains exempt whatever the agency chooses\nto do.\n   The situation is different when it comes to a statute\ngiving an agency discretion to prohibit the disclosure of\ninformation. The information is not prohibited from dis-\nclosure by statute regardless of what the agency does. It\nis the agency’s exercise of discretion that determines\nwhether there is a prohibition at all. Thus, when Section\n114(r)(1) gave the TSA the discretion to prohibit the dis-\nclosure of information, the statute did not create a prohibi-\ntion—it gave the TSA the power to create one. And be-\ncause Section 114(r)(1) did not create a prohibition,\nMacLean’s disclosure was not “prohibited by law” under\nSection 2302(b)(8)(A), but only by a regulation issued in\nthe TSA’s discretion.\n   In any event, Robertson was a case about FOIA, not\nSection 2302, and our analysis there depended on two\nFOIA-specific factors that are not present here. First, we\nexamined the legislative history of FOIA and determined\nthat Congress did not intend that statute to affect laws\nlike the Federal Aviation Act. 422 U. S., at 263–265. In\nparticular, we noted that the Civil Aeronautics Board had\n14   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexpressed its view during congressional hearings that the\nFederal Aviation Act qualified as an exempting statute\nunder FOIA, and that “no question was raised or challenge\nmade” to the agency’s view. Id., at 264–265. But that\nlegislative history can have no effect on our analysis of\nSection 2302(b)(8)(A).\n   Second, we said that the Federal Aviation Act could fail\nto qualify as an exempting statute only if we read FOIA\n“as repealing by implication all existing statutes which\nrestrict public access to specific Government records.” Id.,\nat 265 (internal quotation marks omitted). Then, relying\non the presumption that “repeals by implication are disfa-\nvored,” we rejected that interpretation of FOIA. But the\npresumption against implied repeals has no relevance\nhere. Saying that Section 114(r)(1) is not a prohibition\nunder the whistleblower statute is not the same as saying\nthat the whistleblower statute implicitly repealed Section\n114(r)(1). On the contrary, Section 114(r)(1) remains in\nforce by allowing the TSA to deny FOIA requests and\nprohibit employee disclosures that do not qualify for whis-\ntleblower protection under Section 2302(b)(8)(A).\n   Ultimately, FOIA and Section 2302(b)(8)(A) are different\nstatutes—they have different language, different histories,\nand were enacted in different contexts. Our interpretation\nof one, therefore, has no impact whatsoever on our inter-\npretation of the other.\n                               III\n   Finally, the Government warns that providing whistle-\nblower protection to individuals like MacLean would\n“gravely endanger public safety.” Brief for Petitioner 38.\nThat protection, the Government argues, would make the\nconfidentiality of sensitive security information depend on\nthe idiosyncratic judgment of each of the TSA’s 60,000\nemployees. Id., at 37. And those employees will “most\nlikely lack access to all of the information that led the TSA\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto make particular security decisions.” Id., at 38. Thus,\nthe Government says, we should conclude that Congress\ndid not intend for Section 2302(b)(8)(A) to cover disclo-\nsures like MacLean’s.\n   Those concerns are legitimate. But they are concerns\nthat must be addressed by Congress or the President,\nrather than by this Court. Congress could, for example,\namend Section 114(r)(1) so that the TSA’s prohibitions on\ndisclosure override the whistleblower protections in Sec-\ntion 2302(b)(8)(A)—just as those prohibitions currently\noverride FOIA. See §114(r)(1) (authorizing the TSA to\nprohibit disclosures “[n]otwithstanding section 552 of title\n5”); see also 10 U. S. C. §2640(h) (“the Secretary of Defense\nmay (notwithstanding any other provision of law) withhold\nfrom public disclosure safety-related information that is\nprovided to the Secretary voluntarily by an air carrier for\nthe purposes of this section”). Congress could also exempt\nthe TSA from the requirements of Section 2302(b)(8)(A)\nentirely, as Congress has already done for the Federal\nBureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency,\nthe Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the\nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence, and the\nNational Reconnaissance Office.             See 5 U. S. C.\n§2302(a)(2)(C)(ii)(I).\n   Likewise, the President could prohibit the disclosure of\nsensitive security information by Executive order. Indeed,\nthe Government suggested at oral argument that the\nPresident could “entirely duplicate” the regulations that\nthe TSA has issued under Section 114(r)(1). Tr. of Oral\nArg. 16–20. Such an action would undoubtedly create an\nexception to the whistleblower protections found in Sec-\ntion 2302(b)(8)(A).\n   Although Congress and the President each has the\npower to address the Government’s concerns, neither has\ndone so. It is not our role to do so for them.\n16   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.

I have no\nqualms with the Court’s conclusion that the phrase “spe-\ncifically prohibited by law,” as used in the Whistleblower\nProtection Act of 1989 (WPA), 5 U. S. C. §2302(b)(8)(A),\ndoes not encompass disclosures prohibited only by regula-\ntion. See ante, at 7. Nor do I see any problem in the\ndistinction the Court draws between statutes that prohibit\ninformation from being disclosed, the violation of which\nmay preclude application of the WPA, and statutes that\nsimply exempt information from otherwise-applicable\ndisclosure requirements, which do not trigger the WPA’s\n“prohibited by law” exception. See ante, at 12–13.\n   I part ways with the Court, however, when it concludes\nthat 49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1) does not itself prohibit the type\nof disclosure at issue here—the release of information\nregarding the absence of federal air marshals on overnight\nflights. Ante, at 11. That statute provides, in relevant\npart, that the Transportation Security Administration\n(TSA) “shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclo-\nsure of information obtained or developed in carrying out\nsecurity . . . if the Under Secretary decides that disclosing\nthe information would . . . be detrimental to the security of\ntransportation.” §114(r)(1) (emphasis added).\n2     DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  The Court reasons, first, that Section 114(r)(1) does not\n“prohibit anything,” but instead simply “authorizes” the\nTSA to prescribe regulations. Ante, at 11. But this con-\ntention overlooks the statute’s use of the word “shall,”\nwhich, as we have observed, “generally means ‘must.’ ”\nGutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 432, n. 9\n(1995); see also, e.g., Federal. Express Corp. v. Holowecki,\n552 U. S. 389, 400 (2008) (“Congress’ use of the term ‘shall’\nindicates an intent to ‘impose discretionless obligations’ ”)\n(some internal quotation marks omitted)); A. Scalia & B.\nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n114 (2012) (“[W]hen the word shall can reasonably read as\nmandatory, it ought to be so read”). Section 114(r)(1) does\nnot merely authorize the TSA to promulgate regulations; it\ndirects it to do so, and describes what those regulations\nmust accomplish.\n  The Court focuses, second, on the fact that Section\n114(r) authorizes the TSA to “ ‘decid[e]’ ” whether the\ndisclosure of a particular item of information would in fact\nbe “ ‘detrimental to the security of transportation.’ ” Ante,\nat 11–12 (emphasis deleted). I certainly agree that this\nlanguage vests some discretion in the agency.1 But the\n——————\n  1 The Court does not address respondent’s alternative argument,\n\naccepted by the Court of Appeals below, that Section 114(r)(1) describes\nthe information encompassed in its prohibitory scope with insufficient\nparticularity to qualify the disclosure here as “specifically prohibited by\nlaw” within the meaning of the WPA. Some of the legislative history of\nthe WPA linked its specificity requirement to the criteria established in\nExemption 3 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(3),\nand the Court of Appeals applied this standard. See 714 F. 3d 1301,\n1309 (CA Fed. 2013); see also S. Rep. No. 95–969, pp. 21–22 (1978).\nMacLean has offered no argument that a WPA anti-disclosure statute\nmust define the relevant category of information with any greater\ndegree of particularity. Assuming the Exemption 3 standard is appli-\ncable, I note that Section 114(r) is at least as “specific” as the statutory\nprovisions we have previously held to satisfy Exemption 3’s require-\nments. See, e.g., Department of Justice v. Julian, 486 U. S. 1, 9 (1988)\n(holding that provisions of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

In concluding that such residual agency discre-\ntion deprives Section 114(r) of prohibitory effect, the Court\noverlooks the degree of agency involvement that is neces-\nsary in the administration of many antidisclosure stat-\nutes. Congress cannot be expected to identify with partic-\nularity each individual document or datum the release of\nwhich it wants to preclude. Often, it will have to leave to\nan agency or other enforcing authority the tasks of defin-\ning—perhaps through regulations—exactly what type of\ninformation falls within the scope of the congressional\nprohibition, and of determining whether a particular item\nof information fits the bill. The enforcing authority may,\nas the Court puts it, sometimes be required to make some\n“fine-grained distinction[s]” in fulfilling this charge, ante,\nat 12, but that does not change the fact that Congress\nitself is the source of the prohibition on disclosure.2\n   Indeed, Congress appears to have anticipated the need\nfor agency involvement in the interpretation and enforce-\n\n——————\n32(c)(3)(A) and former 18 U. S. C. §4208(c)(1982 ed.) prohibiting disclo-\nsure of portions of presentence reports “relat[ed] to confidential sources,\ndiagnostic opinions, and other information that may cause harm to the\ndefendant or to third parties” could justify withholding under Exemp-\ntion 3 (emphasis added)).\n   2 For the same reasons, the agency’s decision that a disclosure con-\n\ntravened a statute may not necessarily be determinative in any given\nWPA case: Although an agency may no doubt receive deference in the\ninterpretation and implementation of a prohibitory statute, ultimately\nWPA protection will not apply if the agency improperly concluded that\na given disclosure was prohibited by that statute. Cf. CIA v. Sims, 471\nU. S. 159, 168–181 (1985) (according deference to Central Intelligence\nAgency’s expertise, but engaging in an extended analysis of whether\nthe particular information the agency refused to disclose fell within the\nscope of the statutory prohibition).\n4    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nment of antidisclosure statutes at the time it enacted the\nWPA. The Senate Report to the WPA identified only two\nstatutes the violation of which would preclude whistle-\nblower protection, the first being Section 102(d)(3) of the\nNational Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 498, which pro-\nvided that “the Director of Central Intelligence shall be re-\nsponsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods\nfrom unauthorized disclosure.” See S. Rep. No. 95–969,\npp. 21–22 (1978). This example clearly suggests Congress\ncontemplated that a statute directing an agency to protect\nagainst disclosures and delegating substantial authority to\nthe agency should nevertheless be deemed to impose the\nrelevant prohibition. Section 114(r)(1)’s delegation to the\nTSA to “decide” whether the release of particular infor-\nmation would be “detrimental to the security of transpor-\ntation” likewise simply reflects Congress’ recognition of\nthe inevitable fact that the agency will be tasked, in the\nfirst instance, with enforcing its statutory mandate.\n   In sum, with Section 114(r)(1), Congress has required\nagency action that would preclude the release of infor-\nmation “detrimental to the security of transportation.” In\nso doing, Congress has expressed its clear intent to pro-\nhibit such disclosures. I would respect its intent, and hold\nthat a disclosure contravening that mandate is “prohibited\nby law” within the meaning of the WPA.\n   Having said all that, I appreciate the narrowness of the\nCourt’s holding. The Court’s conclusion that Section\n114(r) does not itself prohibit any disclosures depends\nentirely on the statutory language directing the agency to\n“prescribe regulations,” and providing that the agency will\n“decid[e]” what information falls within the statue’s pur-\nview. See ante, at 11. From all that appears in the major-\nity opinion, then, this case would likely have turned out\ndifferently if Section 114(r) instead provided: “The disclo-\nsure of information detrimental to the security of trans-\nportation is prohibited, and the TSA shall promulgate\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

In so surrendering, however, the Court\nwould appear to have enabled future courts and Con-\ngresses to avoid easily the consequences of its ruling, and\nthus to have limited much of the potential for adverse\npractical effects beyond this case. But in the interim, at\nleast, the Court has left important decisions regarding the\ndisclosure of critical information completely to the whims\nof individual employees.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 2771753, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/01/21/department_of_homeland_security_v._maclean.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2014                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

A few days after the briefing, MacLean received from the\n  TSA a text message cancelling all overnight missions from Las Vegas\n  until early August. MacLean, who was stationed in Las Vegas, be-\n  lieved that cancelling those missions during a hijacking alert was\n  dangerous and illegal. He therefore contacted a reporter and told\n  him about the TSA’s decision to cancel the missions. After discover-\n  ing that MacLean was the source of the disclosure, the TSA fired him\n  for disclosing sensitive security information without authorization.\n     MacLean challenged his firing before the Merit Systems Protection\n  Board. He argued that his disclosure was whistleblowing activity\n  under 5 U. S. C. §2302(b)(8)(A), which protects employees who dis-\n  close information that reveals “any violation of any law, rule, or regu-\n  lation,” or “a substantial and specific danger to public health or safe-\n  ty.” The Board held that MacLean did not qualify for protection\n2      DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    under that statute because his disclosure was “specifically prohibited\n    by law,” §2302(b)(8)(A)—namely, by 49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1). The Court\n    of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the Board’s decision, hold-\n    ing that Section 114(r)(1) was not a prohibition.\nHeld: MacLean’s disclosure was not “specifically prohibited by law.”\n Pp. 5–16.\n    (a) The Government argues that MacLean’s disclosure was “specifi-\n cally prohibited by law” in two ways: first, by the TSA’s regulations\n on sensitive security information, and second, by Section 114(r)(1) it-\n self, which authorized the TSA to promulgate those regulations.\n Pp. 5–14.\n      (i) MacLean’s disclosure was not prohibited by the TSA’s regula-\n tions for purposes of Section 2302(b)(8)(A) because regulations do not\n qualify as “law” under that statute. Throughout Section 2302, Con-\n gress repeatedly used the phrase “law, rule, or regulation.” But Con-\n gress did not use that phrase in the statutory language at issue here;\n it used the word “law” standing alone. Congress’s choice to say “spe-\n cifically prohibited by law,” instead of “specifically prohibited by law,\n rule, or regulation” suggests that Congress meant to exclude rules\n and regulations. In addition, Section 2302(b)(8)(A) creates a second\n exception for disclosures “required by Executive order to be kept se-\n cret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign af-\n fairs.” That the second exception is limited to actions by the Presi-\n dent himself suggests that the first exception does not include action\n taken by executive agencies. Finally, interpreting the word “law” to\n include rules and regulations could defeat the purpose of the whistle-\n blower statute. That interpretation would allow an agency to insu-\n late itself from Section 2302(b)(8)(A) simply by promulgating a regu-\n lation that “specifically prohibited” all whistleblowing.\n    The Government proposes two alternative interpretations, but nei-\n ther is persuasive. First, the Government argues that the word “law”\n includes all regulations that have the “force and effect of law.” The\n Government bases this argument on the decision in Chrysler Corp. v.\n Brown, 441 U. S. 281, where this Court held that legislative regula-\n tions generally fall within the meaning of the word “law” unless there\n is a “clear showing of contrary legislative intent.” Id., at 295–296.\n But Congress’s use of the word “law,” in close connection with the\n phrase “law, rule, or regulation,” provides the necessary “clear show-\n ing” that “law” does not include regulations in this case. Second, the\n Government argues that the word “law” includes at least those regu-\n lations that were “promulgated pursuant to an express congressional\n directive.” The Government, however, was unable to find a single ex-\n ample of the word “law” being used in that way. Pp. 6–11.\n      (ii) Likewise, MacLean’s disclosure was not prohibited by Section\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  114(r)(1). That statute does not prohibit anything; instead, it author-\n  izes the TSA to “prescribe regulations.” Thus, by its terms, Section\n  114(r)(1) did not prohibit the disclosure here. The Government re-\n  sponds that Section 114(r)(1) did prohibit MacLean’s disclosure by\n  imposing a “legislative mandate” on the TSA to promulgate regula-\n  tions to that effect. But the statute affords substantial discretion to\n  the TSA in deciding whether to prohibit any particular disclosure.\n  Thus, it is the TSA’s regulations—not the statute—that prohibited\n  MacLean’s disclosure, and those regulations do not qualify as “law”\n  under Section 2302(b)(8)(A). Pp. 11–14.\n     (b) The Government argues that providing whistleblower protec-\n  tion to individuals like MacLean would “gravely endanger public\n  safety” by making the confidentiality of sensitive security infor-\n  mation depend on the idiosyncratic judgment of each of the TSA’s\n  60,000 employees. Those concerns are legitimate, but they must be\n  addressed by Congress or the President, rather than by this Court.\n  Pp. 14–15.\n714 F. 3d. 1301, affirmed.\n\n  ROBERTS, C.

S. C. §2302(b)(8)(A). An exception exists, however, for\ndisclosures that are “specifically prohibited by law.” Ibid.\nHere, a federal air marshal publicly disclosed that the\nTransportation Security Administration (TSA) had de-\ncided to cut costs by removing air marshals from certain\nlong-distance flights. The question presented is whether\nthat disclosure was “specifically prohibited by law.”\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  In 2002, Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act,\n116 Stat. 2135. As relevant here, that Act provides that\nthe TSA “shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the dis-\nclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying\nout security . . . if the Under Secretary decides that dis-\nclosing the information would . . . be detrimental to the\n2    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsecurity of transportation.” 49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1)(C).\n   Around the same time, the TSA promulgated regula-\ntions prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of what it\ncalled “sensitive security information.” See 67 Fed. Reg.\n8351 (2002). The regulations described 18 categories of\nsensitive security information, including “[s]pecific details\nof aviation security measures . . . [such as] information\nconcerning specific numbers of Federal Air Marshals,\ndeployments or missions, and the methods involved in\nsuch operations.” 49 CFR §1520.7(j) (2002). Sensitive\nsecurity information is not classified, so the TSA can share\nit with individuals who do not have a security clearance,\nsuch as airport employees. Compare Exec. Order 13526,\n§4.1, 3 CFR 298, 314–315 (2009 Comp.), with 49 CFR\n§1520.11(c) (2013).\n                                B\n  Robert J. MacLean became a federal air marshal for the\nTSA in 2001. In that role, MacLean was assigned to pro-\ntect passenger flights from potential hijackings. See 49\nU. S. C. §44917(a).\n  On July 26, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security\n(DHS) issued a confidential advisory about a potential\nhijacking plot. The advisory said that members of the\nterrorist group al Qaeda were planning to attack passen-\nger flights, and that they “considered suicide hijackings\nand bombings as the most promising methods to destroy\naircraft in flight, as well as to strike ground targets.” App.\n16. The advisory identified a number of potential targets,\nincluding the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, and the\neast coast of the United States. Finally, the advisory\nwarned that at least one of the attacks “could be executed\nby the end of the summer 2003.” Ibid.\n  The TSA soon summoned all air marshals (including\nMacLean) for face-to-face briefings about the hijacking\nplot. During MacLean’s briefing, a TSA official told him\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the hijackers were planning to “smuggle weapons in\ncamera equipment or children’s toys through foreign\nsecurity,” and then “fly into the United States . . . into an\nairport that didn’t require them to be screened.” Id., at 92.\nThe hijackers would then board U. S. flights, “overpower\nthe crew or the Air Marshals and . . . fly the planes into\nEast Coast targets.” Id., at 93.\n   A few days after the briefing, MacLean received from\nthe TSA a text message cancelling all overnight missions\nfrom Las Vegas until early August. MacLean, who was\nstationed in Las Vegas, believed that cancelling those\nmissions during a hijacking alert was dangerous. He also\nbelieved that the cancellations were illegal, given that\nfederal law required the TSA to put an air marshal on\nevery flight that “present[s] high security risks,” 49\nU. S. C. §44917(a)(2), and provided that “nonstop, long\ndistance flights, such as those targeted on September 11,\n2001, should be a priority,” §44917(b). See App. 95, 99,\n101.\n   MacLean therefore asked a supervisor why the TSA had\ncanceled the missions. The supervisor responded that the\nTSA wanted “to save money on hotel costs because there\nwas no more money in the budget.” Id., at 95. MacLean\nalso called the DHS Inspector General’s Office to report\nthe cancellations. But a special agent in that office told\nhim there was “nothing that could be done.” Id., at 97.\n   Unwilling to accept those responses, MacLean contacted\nan MSNBC reporter and told him about the canceled\nmissions. In turn, the reporter published a story about\nthe TSA’s decision, titled “Air Marshals pulled from key\nflights.” Id., at 36. The story reported that air marshals\nwould “no longer be covering cross-country or international\nflights” because the agency did not want them “to incur\nthe expense of staying overnight in hotels.” Ibid. The\nstory also reported that the cancellations were “particularly\ndisturbing to some” because they “coincide[d] with a\n4     DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnew high-level hijacking threat issued by the Department\nof Homeland Security.” Id., at 37.\n   After MSNBC published the story, several Members of\nCongress criticized the cancellations. Within 24 hours, the\nTSA reversed its decision and put air marshals back on\nthe flights. Id., at 50.\n   At first, the TSA did not know that MacLean was the\nsource of the disclosure. In September 2004, however,\nMacLean appeared on NBC Nightly News to criticize the\nTSA’s dress code for air marshals, which he believed made\nthem too easy to identify. Although MacLean appeared in\ndisguise, several co-workers recognized his voice, and the\nTSA began investigating the appearance. During that\ninvestigation, MacLean admitted that he had disclosed the\ntext message back in 2003. Consequently, in April 2006,\nthe TSA fired MacLean for disclosing sensitive security\ninformation without authorization.\n   MacLean challenged his firing before the Merit Systems\nProtection Board, arguing in relevant part that his disclo-\nsure was protected whistleblowing activity under 5\nU. S. C. §2302(b)(8)(A). The Board held that MacLean did\nnot qualify for protection under that statute, however,\nbecause his disclosure was “specifically prohibited by law.”\n116 MSPR 562, 569–572 (2011).\n   The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the\nBoard’s decision. 714 F. 3d 1301 (2013). The parties had\nagreed that, in order for MacLean’s disclosure to be “spe-\ncifically prohibited by law,” it must have been “prohibited\nby a statute rather than by a regulation.” Id., at 1308\n(emphasis added). Thus, the issue before the court was\nwhether the statute authorizing the TSA’s regulations—\nnow codified at 49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1)—“specifically prohib-\nited” MacLean’s disclosure. 714 F. 3d, at 1308.*\n——————\n  * This statute has a complicated history. It was codified at 49 U. S. C.\n§40119(b)(1) when the TSA initially promulgated its regulations on\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   The court first held that Section 114(r)(1) was not a\nprohibition. The statute did “not expressly prohibit em-\nployee disclosures,” the court explained, but instead em-\npowered the TSA to “prescribe regulations prohibiting\ndisclosure[s]” if the TSA decided that disclosing the infor-\nmation would harm public safety. Id., at 1309. The court\ntherefore concluded that MacLean’s disclosure was prohib-\nited by a regulation, which the parties had agreed could\nnot be a “law” under Section 2302(b)(8)(A). Ibid.\n   The court then held that, even if Section 114(r)(1) were\na prohibition, it was not “sufficiently specific.” Ibid. The\ncourt explained that a law is sufficiently specific only if it\n“requires that matters be withheld from the public as to\nleave no discretion on the issue, or . . . establishes particu-\nlar criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of\nmatters to be withheld.” Ibid. (quoting S. Rep. No. 95–969\n(1978)). And Section 114(r)(1) did not meet that test\nbecause it “provide[d] only general criteria for withholding\ninformation and [gave] some discretion to the [TSA] to\nfashion regulations for prohibiting disclosure.” 714 F. 3d,\nat 1309. The court accordingly vacated the Board’s deci-\nsion and remanded for a determination of whether Mac-\nLean’s disclosure met the other requirements under Sec-\ntion 2302(b)(8)(A). Id., at 1310–1311.\n   We granted certiorari. 572 U. S. ___ (2014).\n                            II\n  Section 2302(b)(8) provides, in relevant part, that a\nfederal agency may not take\n     “a personnel action with respect to any employee or\n     applicant for employment because of\n——————\nsensitive security information. It was codified at §114(s)(1) when\nMacLean disclosed the text message to MSNBC. And it is now codified\nat §114(r)(1). The Federal Circuit referred to §40119(b)(1) in its opin-\nion. Because the statute has remained identical in all relevant re-\nspects, however, we and the parties refer to the current version.\n6    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    “(A) any disclosure of information by an employee or\n    applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably\n    believes evidences\n    “(i) any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or\n    “(ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an\n    abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific dan-\n    ger to public health or safety,\n    “if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law\n    and if such information is not specifically required by\n    Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of na-\n    tional defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.”\n   The Government argues that this whistleblower statute\ndoes not protect MacLean because his disclosure regarding\nthe canceled missions was “specifically prohibited by law”\nin two ways. First, the Government argues that the dis-\nclosure was specifically prohibited by the TSA’s regula-\ntions on sensitive security information: 49 CFR\n§§1520.5(a)–(b), 1520.7(j) (2003). Second, the Government\nargues that the disclosure was specifically prohibited by\n49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1), which authorized the TSA to pro-\nmulgate those regulations. We address each argument in\nturn.\n                                A\n                                 1\n   In 2003, the TSA’s regulations prohibited the disclosure\nof “[s]pecific details of aviation security measures . . . [such\nas] information concerning specific numbers of Federal Air\nMarshals, deployments or missions, and the methods\ninvolved in such operations.” 49 CFR §1520.7(j). Mac-\nLean does not dispute before this Court that the TSA’s\nregulations prohibited his disclosure regarding the can-\nceled missions. Thus, the question here is whether a\ndisclosure that is specifically prohibited by regulation is\nalso “specifically prohibited by law” under Section\n2302(b)(8)(A). (Emphasis added.)\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The answer is no. Throughout Section 2302, Congress\nrepeatedly used the phrase “law, rule, or regulation.” For\nexample, Section 2302(b)(1)(E) prohibits a federal agency\nfrom discriminating against an employee “on the basis of\nmarital status or political affiliation, as prohibited under\nany law, rule, or regulation.” For another example, Sec-\ntion 2302(b)(6) prohibits an agency from “grant[ing] any\npreference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or\nregulation.” And for a third example, Section 2302(b)\n(9)(A) prohibits an agency from retaliating against an\nemployee for “the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or\ngrievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation.”\n   In contrast, Congress did not use the phrase “law, rule,\nor regulation” in the statutory language at issue here; it\nused the word “law” standing alone. That is significant\nbecause Congress generally acts intentionally when it uses\nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it\nin another. Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23\n(1983). Thus, Congress’s choice to say “specifically prohib-\nited by law” rather than “specifically prohibited by law,\nrule, or regulation” suggests that Congress meant to ex-\nclude rules and regulations.\n   The interpretive canon that Congress acts intentionally\nwhen it omits language included elsewhere applies with\nparticular force here for two reasons. First, Congress used\n“law” and “law, rule, or regulation” in close proximity—\nindeed, in the same sentence. §2302(b)(8)(A) (protecting\nthe disclosure of “any violation of any law, rule, or regula-\ntion . . . if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by\nlaw”). Second, Congress used the broader phrase “law,\nrule, or regulation” repeatedly—nine times in Section 2302\nalone. See §§2302(a)(2)(D)(i), (b)(1)(E), (b)(6), (b)(8)(A)(i),\n(b)(8)(B)(i), (b)(9)(A), (b)(12), (b)(13), (d)(5). Those two\naspects of the whistleblower statute make Con-\ngress’s choice to use the narrower word “law” seem quite\ndeliberate.\n8    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We drew the same inference in Department of Treasury,\nIRS v. FLRA, 494 U. S. 922 (1990). There, the Govern-\nment argued that the word “laws” in one section of the\nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 meant the same thing as\nthe phrase “law, rule, or regulation” in another section of\nthe Act. Id., at 931. We rejected that argument as “sim-\nply contrary to any reasonable interpretation of the text.”\nId., at 932. Indeed, we held that a statute that referred to\n“laws” in one section and “law, rule, or regulation” in\nanother “cannot, unless we abandon all pretense at precise\ncommunication, be deemed to mean the same thing in\nboth places.” Ibid. That inference is even more compel-\nling here, because the statute refers to “law” and “law,\nrule, or regulation” in the same sentence, rather than\nseveral sections apart.\n   Another part of the statutory text points the same way.\nAfter creating an exception for disclosures “specifically\nprohibited by law,” Section 2302(b)(8)(A) goes on to create\na second exception for information “specifically required\nby Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of\nnational defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.” This\nexception is limited to action taken directly by the Presi-\ndent. That suggests that the word “law” in the only other\nexception is limited to actions by Congress—after all, it\nwould be unusual for the first exception to include action\ntaken by executive agencies, when the second exception\nrequires action by the President himself.\n   In addition, a broad interpretation of the word “law”\ncould defeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute. If\n“law” included agency rules and regulations, then an\nagency could insulate itself from the scope of Section\n2302(b)(8)(A) merely by promulgating a regulation that\n“specifically prohibited” whistleblowing. But Congress\npassed the whistleblower statute precisely because it did\nnot trust agencies to regulate whistleblowers within their\nranks. Thus, it is unlikely that Congress meant to include\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrules and regulations within the word “law.”\n                               2\n  The Government admits that some regulations fall\noutside the word “law” as used in Section 2302(b)(8)(A).\nBut, the Government says, that does not mean that all\nregulations are excluded. The Government suggests two\ninterpretations that would distinguish “law” from “law,\nrule, or regulation,” but would still allow the word “law”\nto subsume the TSA’s regulations on sensitive security\ninformation.\n  First, the Government argues that the word “law” in-\ncludes all regulations that have the “force and effect of\nlaw” (i.e., legislative regulations), while excluding those\nthat do not (e.g., interpretive rules). Brief for Petitioner\n19–22. The Government bases this argument on our\ndecision in Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281 (1979).\nThere, we held that legislative regulations generally fall\nwithin the meaning of the word “law,” and that it would\ntake a “clear showing of contrary legislative intent” before\nwe concluded otherwise. Id., at 295–296. Thus, because\nthe TSA’s regulations have the force and effect of law, the\nGovernment says that they should qualify as “law” under\nthe statute.\n  The Government’s description of Chrysler is accurate\nenough. But Congress’s use of the word “law,” in close\nconnection with the phrase “law, rule, or regulation,”\nprovides the necessary “clear showing” that “law” does not\ninclude regulations. Indeed, using “law” and “law, rule, or\nregulation” in the same sentence would be a very obscure\nway of drawing the Government’s nuanced distinction\nbetween different types of regulations. Had Congress\nwanted to draw that distinction, there were far easier and\nclearer ways to do so. For example, at the time Congress\npassed Section 2302(b)(8)(A), another federal statute\ndefined the words “regulatory order” to include a “rule or\n10   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nregulation, if it has the force and effect of law.” 7 U. S. C.\n§450c(a) (1976 ed.). Likewise, another federal statute\ndefined the words “State law” to include “all laws, deci-\nsions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the\neffect of law.” 29 U. S. C. §1144(c)(1) (1976 ed.). As those\nexamples show, Congress knew how to distinguish be-\ntween regulations that had the force and effect of law and\nthose that did not, but chose not to do so in Section\n2302(b)(8)(A).\n   Second, the Government argues that the word “law”\nincludes at least those regulations that were “promulgated\npursuant to an express congressional directive.” Brief for\nPetitioner 21. Outside of this case, however, the Govern-\nment was unable to find a single example of the word\n“law” being used in that way. Not a single dictionary\ndefinition, not a single statute, not a single case. The\nGovernment’s interpretation happens to fit this case pre-\ncisely, but it needs more than that to recommend it.\n   Although the Government argues here that the word\n“law” includes rules and regulations, it definitively re-\njected that argument in the Court of Appeals. For exam-\nple, the Government’s brief accepted that the word “law”\nmeant “legislative enactment,” and said that the “only\ndispute” was whether 49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1) “serve[d] as\nthat legislative enactment.” Brief for Respondent in No.\n11–3231 (CA Fed.), pp. 46–47. Then, at oral argument, a\njudge asked the Government’s attorney the following\nquestion: “I thought I understood your brief to concede\nthat [the word “law”] can’t be a rule or regulation, it\nmeans statute. Am I wrong?” The Government’s attorney\nresponded: “You’re not wrong your honor. I’ll be as clear\nas I can. ‘Specifically prohibited by law’ here means stat-\nute.” Oral Arg. Audio in No. 11–3231, at 22:42–23:03; see\nalso id., at 29:57–30:03 (“Now, as we’ve been discussing\nhere, we’re not saying here that [the word “law”] needs to\nencompass regulations. We’re saying statute.”). Those\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconcessions reinforce our conclusion that the Govern-\nment’s proposed interpretations are unpersuasive.\n  In sum, when Congress used the phrase “specifically\nprohibited by law” instead of “specifically prohibited by\nlaw, rule, or regulation,” it meant to exclude rules and\nregulations. We therefore hold that the TSA’s regulations\ndo not qualify as “law” for purposes of Section\n2302(b)(8)(A).\n                                B\n   We next consider whether MacLean’s disclosure regard-\ning the canceled missions was “specifically prohibited” by\n49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1) itself. As relevant here, that statute\nprovides that the TSA “shall prescribe regulations prohib-\niting the disclosure of information obtained or developed\nin carrying out security . . . if the Under Secretary decides\nthat disclosing the information would . . . be detrimental\nto the security of transportation.” §114(r)(1)(C).\n   This statute does not prohibit anything. On the con-\ntrary, it authorizes something—it authorizes the Under\nSecretary to “prescribe regulations.” Thus, by its terms\nSection 114(r)(1) did not prohibit the disclosure at issue\nhere.\n   The Government responds that Section 114(r)(1) did\nprohibit MacLean’s disclosure by imposing a “legislative\nmandate” on the TSA to promulgate regulations to that\neffect. See Brief for Petitioner 28, 33; see also post, at 2–3\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). But the Government pushes\nthe statute too far. Section 114(r)(1) says that the TSA\nshall prohibit disclosures only “if the Under Secretary\ndecides that disclosing the information would . . . be det-\nrimental to the security of transportation.” §114(r)(1)(C)\n(emphasis added). That language affords substantial\ndiscretion to the TSA in deciding whether to prohibit any\nparticular disclosure.\n   The dissent tries to downplay the scope of that discre-\n12   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion, viewing it as the almost ministerial task of “identify-\ning whether a particular piece of information falls within\nthe scope of Congress’ command.” Post, at 3. But deter-\nmining which documents meet the statutory standard of\n“detrimental to the security of transportation” requires the\nexercise of considerable judgment. For example, the Gov-\nernment says that Section 114(r)(1) requires the Under\nSecretary to prohibit disclosures like MacLean’s. The\nGovernment also says, however, that the statute does not\nrequire the Under Secretary to prohibit an employee from\ndisclosing that “federal air marshals will be absent from\nimportant flights, but declining to specify which flights.”\nReply Brief 23. That fine-grained distinction comes not\nfrom Section 114(r)(1) itself, but from the Under Secre-\ntary’s exercise of discretion. It is the TSA’s regulations—\nnot the statute—that prohibited MacLean’s disclosure.\nAnd as the dissent agrees, a regulation does not count as\n“law” under the whistleblower statute. See post, at 1.\n   The Government insists, however, that this grant of\ndiscretion does not make Section 114(r)(1) any less of a\nprohibition. In support, the Government relies on Admin-\nistrator, FAA v. Robertson, 422 U. S. 255 (1975). That\ncase involved the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),\nwhich requires federal agencies to disclose information\nupon request unless, among other things, the information\nis “specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.” 5\nU. S. C. §552(b)(3). In Robertson, we held that the Federal\nAviation Act of 1958 was one such statute, because it gave\nthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) “a broad de-\ngree of discretion” in deciding whether to disclose or with-\nhold information. 422 U. S., at 266.\n   The Government tries to analogize that case to this one.\nIn Robertson, the Government says, the FAA’s discretion\nwhether to disclose information did not preclude a finding\nthat the information was “specifically exempted” from\ndisclosure by statute. So too here, the Government says,\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe TSA’s discretion whether to prohibit disclosure of\ninformation does not preclude a finding that the infor-\nmation is “specifically prohibited” from disclosure by\nSection 114(r)(1). See Brief for Petitioner 30.\n   This analogy fails. FOIA and Section 2302(b)(8)(A)\ndiffer in an important way: The provision of FOIA at issue\ninvolves information that is “exempted” from disclosure,\nwhile Section 2302(b)(8)(A) involves information that is\n“prohibited” from disclosure.\n   A statute that exempts information from mandatory\ndisclosure may nonetheless give the agency discretion to\nrelease that exempt information to the public. In such a\ncase, the agency’s exercise of discretion has no effect on\nwhether the information is “exempted from disclosure by\nstatute”—it remains exempt whatever the agency chooses\nto do.\n   The situation is different when it comes to a statute\ngiving an agency discretion to prohibit the disclosure of\ninformation. The information is not prohibited from dis-\nclosure by statute regardless of what the agency does. It\nis the agency’s exercise of discretion that determines\nwhether there is a prohibition at all. Thus, when Section\n114(r)(1) gave the TSA the discretion to prohibit the dis-\nclosure of information, the statute did not create a prohibi-\ntion—it gave the TSA the power to create one. And be-\ncause Section 114(r)(1) did not create a prohibition,\nMacLean’s disclosure was not “prohibited by law” under\nSection 2302(b)(8)(A), but only by a regulation issued in\nthe TSA’s discretion.\n   In any event, Robertson was a case about FOIA, not\nSection 2302, and our analysis there depended on two\nFOIA-specific factors that are not present here. First, we\nexamined the legislative history of FOIA and determined\nthat Congress did not intend that statute to affect laws\nlike the Federal Aviation Act. 422 U. S., at 263–265. In\nparticular, we noted that the Civil Aeronautics Board had\n14   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexpressed its view during congressional hearings that the\nFederal Aviation Act qualified as an exempting statute\nunder FOIA, and that “no question was raised or challenge\nmade” to the agency’s view. Id., at 264–265. But that\nlegislative history can have no effect on our analysis of\nSection 2302(b)(8)(A).\n   Second, we said that the Federal Aviation Act could fail\nto qualify as an exempting statute only if we read FOIA\n“as repealing by implication all existing statutes which\nrestrict public access to specific Government records.” Id.,\nat 265 (internal quotation marks omitted). Then, relying\non the presumption that “repeals by implication are disfa-\nvored,” we rejected that interpretation of FOIA. But the\npresumption against implied repeals has no relevance\nhere. Saying that Section 114(r)(1) is not a prohibition\nunder the whistleblower statute is not the same as saying\nthat the whistleblower statute implicitly repealed Section\n114(r)(1). On the contrary, Section 114(r)(1) remains in\nforce by allowing the TSA to deny FOIA requests and\nprohibit employee disclosures that do not qualify for whis-\ntleblower protection under Section 2302(b)(8)(A).\n   Ultimately, FOIA and Section 2302(b)(8)(A) are different\nstatutes—they have different language, different histories,\nand were enacted in different contexts. Our interpretation\nof one, therefore, has no impact whatsoever on our inter-\npretation of the other.\n                               III\n   Finally, the Government warns that providing whistle-\nblower protection to individuals like MacLean would\n“gravely endanger public safety.” Brief for Petitioner 38.\nThat protection, the Government argues, would make the\nconfidentiality of sensitive security information depend on\nthe idiosyncratic judgment of each of the TSA’s 60,000\nemployees. Id., at 37. And those employees will “most\nlikely lack access to all of the information that led the TSA\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto make particular security decisions.” Id., at 38. Thus,\nthe Government says, we should conclude that Congress\ndid not intend for Section 2302(b)(8)(A) to cover disclo-\nsures like MacLean’s.\n   Those concerns are legitimate. But they are concerns\nthat must be addressed by Congress or the President,\nrather than by this Court. Congress could, for example,\namend Section 114(r)(1) so that the TSA’s prohibitions on\ndisclosure override the whistleblower protections in Sec-\ntion 2302(b)(8)(A)—just as those prohibitions currently\noverride FOIA. See §114(r)(1) (authorizing the TSA to\nprohibit disclosures “[n]otwithstanding section 552 of title\n5”); see also 10 U. S. C. §2640(h) (“the Secretary of Defense\nmay (notwithstanding any other provision of law) withhold\nfrom public disclosure safety-related information that is\nprovided to the Secretary voluntarily by an air carrier for\nthe purposes of this section”). Congress could also exempt\nthe TSA from the requirements of Section 2302(b)(8)(A)\nentirely, as Congress has already done for the Federal\nBureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency,\nthe Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the\nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence, and the\nNational Reconnaissance Office.             See 5 U. S. C.\n§2302(a)(2)(C)(ii)(I).\n   Likewise, the President could prohibit the disclosure of\nsensitive security information by Executive order. Indeed,\nthe Government suggested at oral argument that the\nPresident could “entirely duplicate” the regulations that\nthe TSA has issued under Section 114(r)(1). Tr. of Oral\nArg. 16–20. Such an action would undoubtedly create an\nexception to the whistleblower protections found in Sec-\ntion 2302(b)(8)(A).\n   Although Congress and the President each has the\npower to address the Government’s concerns, neither has\ndone so. It is not our role to do so for them.\n16   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.

I have no\nqualms with the Court’s conclusion that the phrase “spe-\ncifically prohibited by law,” as used in the Whistleblower\nProtection Act of 1989 (WPA), 5 U. S. C. §2302(b)(8)(A),\ndoes not encompass disclosures prohibited only by regula-\ntion. See ante, at 7. Nor do I see any problem in the\ndistinction the Court draws between statutes that prohibit\ninformation from being disclosed, the violation of which\nmay preclude application of the WPA, and statutes that\nsimply exempt information from otherwise-applicable\ndisclosure requirements, which do not trigger the WPA’s\n“prohibited by law” exception. See ante, at 12–13.\n   I part ways with the Court, however, when it concludes\nthat 49 U. S. C. §114(r)(1) does not itself prohibit the type\nof disclosure at issue here—the release of information\nregarding the absence of federal air marshals on overnight\nflights. Ante, at 11. That statute provides, in relevant\npart, that the Transportation Security Administration\n(TSA) “shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclo-\nsure of information obtained or developed in carrying out\nsecurity . . . if the Under Secretary decides that disclosing\nthe information would . . . be detrimental to the security of\ntransportation.” §114(r)(1) (emphasis added).\n2     DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  The Court reasons, first, that Section 114(r)(1) does not\n“prohibit anything,” but instead simply “authorizes” the\nTSA to prescribe regulations. Ante, at 11. But this con-\ntention overlooks the statute’s use of the word “shall,”\nwhich, as we have observed, “generally means ‘must.’ ”\nGutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 432, n. 9\n(1995); see also, e.g., Federal. Express Corp. v. Holowecki,\n552 U. S. 389, 400 (2008) (“Congress’ use of the term ‘shall’\nindicates an intent to ‘impose discretionless obligations’ ”)\n(some internal quotation marks omitted)); A. Scalia & B.\nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n114 (2012) (“[W]hen the word shall can reasonably read as\nmandatory, it ought to be so read”). Section 114(r)(1) does\nnot merely authorize the TSA to promulgate regulations; it\ndirects it to do so, and describes what those regulations\nmust accomplish.\n  The Court focuses, second, on the fact that Section\n114(r) authorizes the TSA to “ ‘decid[e]’ ” whether the\ndisclosure of a particular item of information would in fact\nbe “ ‘detrimental to the security of transportation.’ ” Ante,\nat 11–12 (emphasis deleted). I certainly agree that this\nlanguage vests some discretion in the agency.1 But the\n——————\n  1 The Court does not address respondent’s alternative argument,\n\naccepted by the Court of Appeals below, that Section 114(r)(1) describes\nthe information encompassed in its prohibitory scope with insufficient\nparticularity to qualify the disclosure here as “specifically prohibited by\nlaw” within the meaning of the WPA. Some of the legislative history of\nthe WPA linked its specificity requirement to the criteria established in\nExemption 3 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(3),\nand the Court of Appeals applied this standard. See 714 F. 3d 1301,\n1309 (CA Fed. 2013); see also S. Rep. No. 95–969, pp. 21–22 (1978).\nMacLean has offered no argument that a WPA anti-disclosure statute\nmust define the relevant category of information with any greater\ndegree of particularity. Assuming the Exemption 3 standard is appli-\ncable, I note that Section 114(r) is at least as “specific” as the statutory\nprovisions we have previously held to satisfy Exemption 3’s require-\nments. See, e.g., Department of Justice v. Julian, 486 U. S. 1, 9 (1988)\n(holding that provisions of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

In concluding that such residual agency discre-\ntion deprives Section 114(r) of prohibitory effect, the Court\noverlooks the degree of agency involvement that is neces-\nsary in the administration of many antidisclosure stat-\nutes. Congress cannot be expected to identify with partic-\nularity each individual document or datum the release of\nwhich it wants to preclude. Often, it will have to leave to\nan agency or other enforcing authority the tasks of defin-\ning—perhaps through regulations—exactly what type of\ninformation falls within the scope of the congressional\nprohibition, and of determining whether a particular item\nof information fits the bill. The enforcing authority may,\nas the Court puts it, sometimes be required to make some\n“fine-grained distinction[s]” in fulfilling this charge, ante,\nat 12, but that does not change the fact that Congress\nitself is the source of the prohibition on disclosure.2\n   Indeed, Congress appears to have anticipated the need\nfor agency involvement in the interpretation and enforce-\n\n——————\n32(c)(3)(A) and former 18 U. S. C. §4208(c)(1982 ed.) prohibiting disclo-\nsure of portions of presentence reports “relat[ed] to confidential sources,\ndiagnostic opinions, and other information that may cause harm to the\ndefendant or to third parties” could justify withholding under Exemp-\ntion 3 (emphasis added)).\n   2 For the same reasons, the agency’s decision that a disclosure con-\n\ntravened a statute may not necessarily be determinative in any given\nWPA case: Although an agency may no doubt receive deference in the\ninterpretation and implementation of a prohibitory statute, ultimately\nWPA protection will not apply if the agency improperly concluded that\na given disclosure was prohibited by that statute. Cf. CIA v. Sims, 471\nU. S. 159, 168–181 (1985) (according deference to Central Intelligence\nAgency’s expertise, but engaging in an extended analysis of whether\nthe particular information the agency refused to disclose fell within the\nscope of the statutory prohibition).\n4    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. MACLEAN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nment of antidisclosure statutes at the time it enacted the\nWPA. The Senate Report to the WPA identified only two\nstatutes the violation of which would preclude whistle-\nblower protection, the first being Section 102(d)(3) of the\nNational Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 498, which pro-\nvided that “the Director of Central Intelligence shall be re-\nsponsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods\nfrom unauthorized disclosure.” See S. Rep. No. 95–969,\npp. 21–22 (1978). This example clearly suggests Congress\ncontemplated that a statute directing an agency to protect\nagainst disclosures and delegating substantial authority to\nthe agency should nevertheless be deemed to impose the\nrelevant prohibition. Section 114(r)(1)’s delegation to the\nTSA to “decide” whether the release of particular infor-\nmation would be “detrimental to the security of transpor-\ntation” likewise simply reflects Congress’ recognition of\nthe inevitable fact that the agency will be tasked, in the\nfirst instance, with enforcing its statutory mandate.\n   In sum, with Section 114(r)(1), Congress has required\nagency action that would preclude the release of infor-\nmation “detrimental to the security of transportation.” In\nso doing, Congress has expressed its clear intent to pro-\nhibit such disclosures. I would respect its intent, and hold\nthat a disclosure contravening that mandate is “prohibited\nby law” within the meaning of the WPA.\n   Having said all that, I appreciate the narrowness of the\nCourt’s holding. The Court’s conclusion that Section\n114(r) does not itself prohibit any disclosures depends\nentirely on the statutory language directing the agency to\n“prescribe regulations,” and providing that the agency will\n“decid[e]” what information falls within the statue’s pur-\nview. See ante, at 11. From all that appears in the major-\nity opinion, then, this case would likely have turned out\ndifferently if Section 114(r) instead provided: “The disclo-\nsure of information detrimental to the security of trans-\nportation is prohibited, and the TSA shall promulgate\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nregulations to that effect,” or “The Under Secretary shall\nprescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of infor-\nmation detrimental to the security of transportation; and\nsuch disclosures are prohibited.” I myself decline to sur-\nrender so fully to sheer formalism, especially where trans-\nportation security is at issue and there is little dispute\nthat the disclosure of air marshals’ locations is potentially\ndangerous and was proscribed by the relevant implement-\ning regulation. In so surrendering, however, the Court\nwould appear to have enabled future courts and Con-\ngresses to avoid easily the consequences of its ruling, and\nthus to have limited much of the potential for adverse\npractical effects beyond this case. But in the interim, at\nleast, the Court has left important decisions regarding the\ndisclosure of critical information completely to the whims\nof individual employees.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2771753/", "sha1": "7c70887cbccdcb9633dcd8fff3f7005ae6d1e43b", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-01-21T08:01:17.471187"}
