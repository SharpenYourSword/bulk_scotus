TACKETT ET AL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 13–1010. Argued November 10, 2014—Decided January 26, 2015\nWhen petitioner M&G Polymers USA, LLC (M&G), purchased the\n Point Pleasant Polyester Plant in 2000, it entered a collective-\n bargaining agreement and related Pension, Insurance, and Service\n Award Agreement (P & I agreement) with respondent union. As rel-\n evant here, the P & I agreement provided that certain retirees, along\n with their surviving spouses and dependents, would “receive a full\n Company contribution towards the cost of [health care] benefits”;\n that such benefits would be provided “for the duration of [the]\n Agreement”; and that the agreement would be subject to renegotia-\n tion in three years.\n    Following the expiration of those agreements, M&G announced\n that it would require retirees to contribute to the cost of their health\n care benefits. Respondent retirees, on behalf of themselves and oth-\n ers similarly situated, sued M&G and related entities, alleging that\n the P & I agreement created a vested right to lifetime contribution-\n free health care benefits.\n    The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a\n claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed based on the reasoning of its\n earlier decision in International Union, United Auto, Aerospace, &\n Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Yard-Man, Inc., 716 F. 2d\n 1476. On remand, the District Court ruled in favor of the retirees,\n and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit’s decision rested on principles that are incom-\n patible with ordinary principles of contract law. Pp. 5–14.\n    (a) The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)\n governs pension and welfare benefits plans, including those estab-\n lished by collective-bargaining agreements. ERISA establishes min-\n imum funding and vesting standards for pension plans, but exempts\n2               M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    welfare benefits plans—which provide the types of benefits at issue\n    here—from those rules. See 29 U. S. C. §§1051(1), 1053, 1081(a)(2),\n    1083. “[E]mployers have large leeway to design . . . welfare plans as\n    they see fit.” Black & Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U. S. 822,\n    833. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) This Court interprets collective-bargaining agreements, includ-\n    ing those establishing ERISA plans, according to ordinary principles\n    of contract law, at least when those principles are not inconsistent\n    with federal labor policy. See Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.,\n    353 U. S. 448, 456–457. When a collective-bargaining agreement is\n    unambiguous, its meaning must be ascertained in accordance with its\n    plainly expressed intent. 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:6, p.\n    108. P. 7.\n       (c) In Yard-Man, the Sixth Circuit found a provision governing re-\n    tiree insurance benefits ambiguous as to the duration of those bene-\n    fits; and, looking to other provisions of the agreement, purported to\n    apply ordinary contract law to resolve the ambiguity. First, the court\n    inferred from the existence of termination provisions for other bene-\n    fits that the absence of a termination provision specifically address-\n    ing retiree benefits expressed an intent to vest those benefits for life.\n    The court then purported to apply the rule that contracts should be\n    interpreted to avoid illusory promises, reasoning that, absent vesting,\n    the promise would be illusory for the subset of retirees who would not\n    become eligible for those benefits before the contract expired. Final-\n    ly, the court relied on “the context” of labor negotiations to resolve\n    the ambiguity, inferring that the parties would have intended such\n    benefits to vest for life because they are not mandatory subjects of\n    collective bargaining; are “typically understood as a form of delayed\n    compensation,” 716 F. 2d, at 1482; and are keyed to the acquisition of\n    retirement status. The court concluded that these contextual clues\n    “outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived from a routine dura-\n    tion clause.” Id., at 1483. The Sixth Circuit has since extended its\n    Yard-Man analysis in a series of other cases. Pp. 7–10.\n       (d) The inferences applied in Yard-Man and its progeny do not rep-\n    resent ordinary principles of contract law. Yard-Man distorts the at-\n    tempt to ascertain the intention of the parties by placing a thumb on\n    the scale in favor of vested retiree benefits in all collective-bargaining\n    agreements. Rather than relying on known customs and usages in a\n    particular industry as proven by the parties, the Yard-Man court re-\n    lied on its own suppositions about the intentions of parties negotiat-\n    ing retiree benefits. It then compounded the error by applying those\n    suppositions indiscriminately across industries. Furthermore, the\n    Sixth Circuit’s refusal to apply general durational clauses to provi-\n    sions governing retiree benefits distorts an agreement’s text and con-\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  flicts with the principle that a written agreement is presumed to en-\n  compass the whole agreement of the parties.\n     Perhaps tugged by its inferences, the Sixth Circuit also misapplied\n  the illusory promises doctrine. It construed provisions that admitted-\n  ly benefited some class of retirees as “illusory” merely because they\n  did not benefit all retirees. That interpretation is a contradiction in\n  terms—a promise that is “partly illusory” is by definition not illusory.\n  And its use of this doctrine is particularly inappropriate in the con-\n  text of collective-bargaining agreements, which often include provi-\n  sions inapplicable to some category of employees.\n     The Sixth Circuit also failed even to consider other traditional con-\n  tract principles, including the rule that courts should not construe\n  ambiguous writings to create lifetime promises and the rule that\n  “contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, upon ter-\n  mination of the bargaining agreement,” Litton Financial Printing\n  Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 207.\n  Pp. 10–14.\n     (e) Though there is no doubt that Yard-Man and its progeny affect-\n  ed the outcome here, the Sixth Circuit should be the first to review\n  the agreements under ordinary principles of contract law.

The retirees (and their former union) claim that\nthese agreements created a right to lifetime contribution-\nfree health care benefits for retirees, their surviving\nspouses, and their dependents. The employer, for its part,\nclaims that those provisions terminated when the agree-\nments expired. The United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Sixth Circuit sided with the retirees, relying on its\nconclusion in International Union, United Auto, Aerospace,\n& Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Yard-Man,\nInc., 716 F. 2d 1476, 1479 (1983), that retiree health care\nbenefits are unlikely to be left up to future negotiations.\nWe granted certiorari and now conclude that such reason-\ning is incompatible with ordinary principles of contract\nlaw. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand for it to apply ordinary principles of\ncontract law in the first instance.\n2          M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   Respondents Hobert Freel Tackett, Woodrow K. Pyles,\nand Harlan B. Conley worked at (and retired from) the\nPoint Pleasant Polyester Plant in Apple Grove, West\nVirginia (hereinafter referred to as the Plant). During\ntheir employment, respondent United Steel, Paper and\nForestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Indus-\ntrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO-\nCLC, or its predecessor unions (hereinafter referred to as\nthe Union), represented them in collective bargaining.\nTackett and Pyles retired in 1996, and Conley retired in\n1998. They represent a class of retired employees from\nthe Plant, along with their surviving spouses and other\ndependents. Petitioner M&G Polymers USA, LLC, is the\ncurrent owner of the Plant.\n   When M&G purchased the Plant in 2000, it entered a\nmaster collective-bargaining agreement and a Pension,\nInsurance, and Service Award Agreement (P & I agree-\nment) with the Union, generally similar to agreements the\nUnion had negotiated with M&G’s predecessor. The P & I\nagreement provided for retiree health care benefits as\nfollows:\n    “Employees who retire on or after January 1, 1996\n    and who are eligible for and receiving a monthly pen-\n    sion under the 1993 Pension Plan . . . whose full years\n    of attained age and full years of attained continuous\n    service . . . at the time of retirement equals 95 or more\n    points will receive a full Company contribution to-\n    wards the cost of [health care] benefits described in\n    this Exhibit B–1 . . . .

Failure to pay\n     the required medical contribution will result in can-\n     cellation of coverage.” App. 415–416.\nExhibit B–1, which described the health care benefits at\nissue, opened with the following durational clause: “Effec-\ntive January 1, 1998, and for the duration of this Agree-\nment thereafter, the Employer will provide the following\nprogram of hospital benefits, hospital-medical benefits,\nsurgical benefits and prescription drug benefits for eligible\nemployees and their dependents . . . . ” Id., at 377–378\n(emphasis deleted). The P & I agreement provided for\nrenegotiation of its terms in three years.1\n                             B\n  In December 2006, M&G announced that it would begin\nrequiring retirees to contribute to the cost of their health\ncare benefits. Respondent retirees, on behalf of them-\nselves and others similarly situated, sued M&G and re-\nlated entities, alleging that the decision to require these\ncontributions breached both the collective-bargaining\nagreement and the P & I agreement, in violation of §301 of\nthe Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA) and\n§502(a)(1)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 891.2 Specifically, the retir-\nees alleged that M&G had promised to provide lifetime\ncontribution-free health care benefits for them, their\nsurviving spouses, and their dependents. They pointed to\n——————\n  1 In accordance with this provision, M&G and the Union began bar-\n\ngaining anew in 2003, ultimately reaching a new agreement in 2005.\nThe provisions of the existing agreements remained in effect during the\ncourse of those negotiations. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 25, n. 1.\n  2 The Union was a plaintiff in the suit and is a respondent here. For\n\nease of reference, we refer to the respondents collectively as “the\nretirees.”\n4           M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe language in the 2000 P & I agreement providing that\nemployees with a certain level of seniority “will receive a\nfull Company contribution towards the cost of [health\ncare] benefits described in . . . Exhibit B–1.” The retirees\nalleged that, with this promise, M&G had created a vested\nright to such benefits that continued beyond the expiration\nof the 2000 P & I agreement.\n   The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to\nstate a claim. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2298979\"><a href=\"/opinion/2298979/tackett-v-m-g-polymers-usa-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 696 (SD Ohio 2007). It\nconcluded that the cited language unambiguously did not\ncreate a vested right to retiree benefits.\n   The Court of Appeals reversed based on the reasoning of\nits earlier decision in Yard-Man. 561 F. 3d 478 (CA6\n2009) (Tackett I). Yard-Man involved a similar claim that\nan employer had breached a collective-bargaining agree-\nment when it terminated retiree benefits. 716 F. 2d, at\n1478. Although the court found the text of the provision in\nthat case ambiguous, it relied on the “context” of labor\nnegotiations to resolve that ambiguity in favor of the\nretirees’ interpretation. Id., at 1482. Specifically, the\ncourt inferred that parties to collective bargaining would\nintend retiree benefits to vest for life because such benefits\nare “not mandatory” or required to be included in collective-\nbargaining agreements, are “typically understood as a\nform of delayed compensation or reward for past services,”\nand are keyed to the acquisition of retirement status.\nIbid. The court concluded that these inferences “out-\nweigh[ed] any contrary implications [about the termina-\ntion of retiree benefits] derived from” general termination\nclauses. Id., at 1483.\n   Applying the Yard-Man inferences on review of the\nDistrict Court’s dismissal of the action, the Court of Ap-\npeals concluded that the retirees had stated a plausible\nclaim. Tackett I, 561 F. 3d, at 490. “Keeping in mind the\ncontext of the labor-management negotiations identified in\nYard-Man,” the court found “it unlikely that [the Union]\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould agree to language that ensures its members a ‘full\nCompany contribution,’ if the company could unilaterally\nchange the level of contribution.” Ibid. The court con-\nstrued the language about “employees” contributing to\ntheir health care premiums as limited to employees who\nhad not attained the requisite seniority points to be enti-\ntled to a full company contribution. Ibid. And it discerned\nan intent to vest lifetime contribution-free health care\nbenefits from provisions tying eligibility for health care\nbenefits to eligibility for pension benefits. Id., at 490–491.\n   On remand, the District Court conducted a bench trial\nand ruled in favor of the retirees. It declined to revisit the\nquestion whether the P & I agreement created a vested\nright to retiree benefits, concluding that the Court of\nAppeals had definitively resolved that issue. It then\nissued a permanent injunction ordering M&G to reinstate\ncontribution-free health care benefits for the individual\nrespondents and similarly situated retirees. 853 F. Supp.\n2d 697 (SD Ohio 2012).\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that, al-\nthough the District Court had erred in treating Tackett I as\na conclusive resolution of the meaning of the P & I agree-\nment, it had not erred in “presum[ing]” that, “in the ab-\nsence of extrinsic evidence to the contrary, the agreements\nindicated an intent to vest lifetime contribution-free bene-\nfits.” 733 F. 3d 589, 600 (CA6 2013) (Tackett II). And\nbecause the District Court had concluded that the prof-\nfered extrinsic evidence was inapplicable, it had not clearly\nerred in finding that the agreement created those vested\nrights.\n   We granted certiorari, 572 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\nvacate and remand.\n                          II\n  This case is about the interpretation of collective-\nbargaining agreements that define rights to welfare bene-\n6           M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfits plans. The LMRA grants federal courts jurisdiction to\nresolve disputes between employers and labor unions\nabout collective-bargaining agreements. 29 U. S. C. §185.\nWhen collective-bargaining agreements create pension or\nwelfare benefits plans, those plans are subject to rules\nestablished in ERISA. ERISA defines pension plans as\nplans, funds, or programs that “provid[e] retirement in-\ncome to employees” or that “resul[t] in a deferral of in-\ncome.” §1002(2)(A). It defines welfare benefits plans as\nplans, funds, or programs established or maintained to\nprovide participants with additional benefits, such as life\ninsurance and disability coverage. §1002(1).\n   ERISA treats these two types of plans differently.\nAlthough ERISA imposes elaborate minimum funding and\nvesting standards for pension plans, §§1053, 1082, 1083,\n1084, it explicitly exempts welfare benefits plans from\nthose rules, §§1051(1), 1081(a)(1). Welfare benefits plans\nmust be “established and maintained pursuant to a writ-\nten instrument,” §1102(a)(1), but “[e]mployers or other\nplan sponsors are generally free under ERISA, for any\nreason at any time, to adopt, modify, or terminate welfare\nplans,” Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U. S.\n73, 78 (1995).        As we have previously recognized,\n“[E]mployers have large leeway to design disability and\nother welfare plans as they see fit.” Black & Decker Dis-\nability Plan v. Nord, 538 U. S. 822, 833 (2003). And, we\nhave observed, the rule that contractual “provisions ordi-\nnarily should be enforced as written is especially appro-\npriate when enforcing an ERISA [welfare benefits] plan.”\nHeimeshoff v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 571 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 7). That is because the “focus\non the written terms of the plan is the linchpin of a system\nthat is not so complex that administrative costs, or litiga-\ntion expenses, unduly discourage employers from offering\n[welfare benefits] plans in the first place.” Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 8) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nomitted).\n  We interpret collective-bargaining agreements, includ-\ning those establishing ERISA plans, according to ordinary\nprinciples of contract law, at least when those principles\nare not inconsistent with federal labor policy. See Textile\nWorkers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 456–457\n(1957). “In this endeavor, as with any other contract, the\nparties’ intentions control.” Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. Animal-\nFeeds Int’l Corp., 559 U. S. 662, 682 (2010) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted). “Where the words of a contract in\nwriting are clear and unambiguous, its meaning is to be\nascertained in accordance with its plainly expressed in-\ntent.” 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:6, p. 108 (4th\ned. 2012) (Williston) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  In this case, the Court of Appeals applied the Yard-Man\ninferences to conclude that, in the absence of extrinsic\nevidence to the contrary, the provisions of the contract\nindicated an intent to vest retirees with lifetime benefits.\nTackett II, 733 F. 3d, at 599–600. As we now explain,\nthose inferences conflict with ordinary principles of con-\ntract law.\n                            III\n                             A\n                             1\n  The Court of Appeals has long insisted that its Yard-\nMan inferences are drawn from ordinary contract law. In\nYard-Man itself, the court purported to apply “traditional\nrules for contractual interpretation.” 716 F. 2d, at 1479.\nThe court first concluded that the provision governing\nretiree insurance benefits—which stated only that the\nemployer “will provide” such benefits—was ambiguous as\nto the duration of those benefits. Id., at 1480. To resolve\nthat ambiguity, it looked to other provisions of the agree-\nment. The agreement included provisions for terminating\nactive employees’ insurance benefits in the case of layoffs\n8           M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand for terminating benefits for a retiree’s spouse and\ndependents in case of the retiree’s death before the expira-\ntion of the collective-bargaining agreement, but no provi-\nsion specifically addressed the duration of retiree health\ncare benefits. Id., at 1481–1482. From the existence of\nthese termination provisions and the absence of a termi-\nnation provision specifically addressing retiree benefits,\nthe court inferred an intent to vest those retiree benefits\nfor life.\n    The court then purported to apply the rule that con-\ntracts should be interpreted to avoid illusory promises. It\nnoted that the retiree insurance provisions “contain[ed] a\npromise that the company will pay an early retiree’s in-\nsurance upon such retiree reaching age 65 but that the\nretiree must bear the cost of company insurance until that\ntime.” Id., at 1481. Employees could retire at age 55, but\nthe agreement containing this promise applied only for a\n3-year term. Ibid. Thus, retirees between the ages of 55\nand 62 would not turn 65 and become eligible for the\ncompany contribution before the 3-year agreement ex-\npired. In light of this fact, the court reasoned that the\npromise would be “completely illusory for many early\nretirees under age 62” if the retiree benefits terminated\nwhen the contract expired. Ibid.\n    Finally, the court turned to “the context” of labor nego-\ntiations. Id., at 1482. It observed that “[b]enefits for\nretirees are . . . not mandatory subjects of collective bar-\ngaining” and that “employees are presumably aware that\nthe union owes no obligation to bargain for continued\nbenefits for retirees.” Ibid. Based on these observations,\nthe court concluded that “it is unlikely that such benefits\n. . . would be left to the contingencies of future negotia-\ntions.” Ibid. It also asserted that “retiree benefits are in a\nsense ‘status’ benefits which, as such, carry with them an\ninference that they continue so long as the prerequisite\nstatus is maintained.” Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Although the contract included a general durational\nclause—meaning that the contract itself would expire at a\nset time—the court concluded that these contextual clues\n“outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived from a\nroutine duration clause.” Id., at 1483.\n                               2\n   Two years after Yard-Man, the court took this analysis\neven further. In a dispute between retirees and a steel\ncompany over retiree health insurance benefits, it con-\nstrued the language “will continue to provide at its ex-\npense, supplemental medicare and major medical benefits\nfor Pensioners aged 65 and over” to “unambiguously con-\nfe[r]” lifetime benefits. Policy v. Powell Pressed Steel Co.,\n770 F. 2d 609, 615 (CA6 1985) (emphasis added). Yet it\nhad interpreted similar language—“will provide insurance\nbenefits equal to the active group”—to be ambiguous in\nYard-Man. The court refused to give any weight to provi-\nsions that supported a contrary construction—namely, one\nestablishing a fund to pay pension, but not welfare, bene-\nfits, and another providing for the continuation of pension,\nbut not welfare, benefits after the agreement expired.\nPolicy, 770 F. 2d, at 615–616. According to the court, a\ncontrary interpretation “would render the Company’s\npromise [of benefits for retirees aged 65 and over] in sub-\nstantial part nugatory and illusory” to retirees who were\n62 or younger when the 3-year agreement was signed.\nIbid. And it faulted the District Court for failing “to give\neffect” to Yard-Man’s admonition “that retiree benefits\nnormally . . . are interminable.” 770 F. 2d, at 616.\n   The Court of Appeals has continued to extend the rea-\nsoning of Yard-Man. Relying on Yard-Man’s statement\nthat context considerations outweigh the effect of a gen-\neral termination clause, it has concluded that, “ ‘[a]bsent\nspecific durational language referring to retiree benefits\nthemselves,’ a general durational clause says nothing\n10          M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nabout the vesting of retiree benefits.” Noe v. PolyOne\nCorp., 520 F. 3d 548, 555 (CA6 2008) (emphasis added). It\nhas also held that a provision that “ties eligibility for\nretirement-health benefits to eligibility for a pension . . .\n[leaves] little room for debate that retirees’ health benefits\nves[t] upon retirement.” Id., at 558 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Commenting on these extensions of\nYard-Man, the court has acknowledged that “there is a\nreasonable argument to be made that, while th[e] court\nhas repeatedly cautioned that Yard-Man does not create a\npresumption of vesting, [it] ha[s] gone on to apply just\nsuch a presumption.” Cole v. ArvinMeritor, Inc., 549 F. 3d\n1064, 1074 (CA6 2008).\n                              B\n   We disagree with the Court of Appeals’ assessment that\nthe inferences applied in Yard-Man and its progeny repre-\nsent ordinary principles of contract law.\n   As an initial matter, Yard-Man violates ordinary con-\ntract principles by placing a thumb on the scale in favor of\nvested retiree benefits in all collective-bargaining agree-\nments. That rule has no basis in ordinary principles of\ncontract law. And it distorts the attempt “to ascertain the\nintention of the parties.” 11 Williston §30:2, at 18 (empha-\nsis added); see also Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at 682. Yard-\nMan’s assessment of likely behavior in collective bargain-\ning is too speculative and too far removed from the context\nof any particular contract to be useful in discerning the\nparties’ intention.\n   And the Court of Appeals derived its assessment of\nlikely behavior not from record evidence, but instead from\nits own suppositions about the intentions of employees,\nunions, and employers negotiating retiree benefits. See\nYard-Man, 716 F. 2d, at 1482. For example, it asserted,\nwithout any foundation, that, “when . . . parties contract\nfor benefits which accrue upon achievement of retiree\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)              11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nstatus, there is an inference that the parties likely in-\ntended those benefits to continue as long as the benefi-\nciary remains a retiree.” Ibid.; see also ibid. (“[I]t is unlikely\nthat [retiree] benefits . . . would be left to the contingen-\ncies of future negotiations”). Although a court may look to\nknown customs or usages in a particular industry to de-\ntermine the meaning of a contract, the parties must prove\nthose customs or usages using affirmative evidentiary\nsupport in a given case. 12 Williston §34:3; accord, Robin-\nson v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 366 (1872); Oelricks v.\nFord, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87316\"><a href=\"/opinion/87316/oelricks-v-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61–62 (1860). Yard-Man relied on no\nrecord evidence indicating that employers and unions in\nthat industry customarily vest retiree benefits. Worse, the\nCourt of Appeals has taken the inferences in Yard-Man\nand applied them indiscriminately across industries. See,\ne.g., Cole, supra, at 1074 (automobile); Armistead v. Ver-\nnitron Corp., 944 F. 2d 1287, 1297 (CA6 1991) (electron-\nics); Policy, supra, at 618 (steel).\n   Because the Court of Appeals did not ground its Yard-\nMan inferences in any record evidence, it is unsurprising\nthat the inferences rest on a shaky factual foundation.\nFor example, Yard-Man relied in part on the premise that\nretiree health care benefits are not subjects of mandatory\ncollective bargaining. Parties, however, can and do volun-\ntarily agree to make retiree benefits a subject of mandato-\nry collective bargaining. Indeed, the employer and union\nin this case entered such an agreement in 2001. App.\n435–436. Yard-Man also relied on the premise that re-\ntiree benefits are a form of deferred compensation, but\nthat characterization is contrary to Congress’ determi-\nnation otherwise. In ERISA, Congress specifically defined\nplans that “resul[t] in a deferral of income by employ-\nees” as pension plans, §1002(2)(A)(ii), and plans that offer\nmedical benefits as welfare plans, §1002(1)(A). Thus,\nretiree health care benefits are not a form of deferred\ncompensation.\n12          M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Further compounding this error, the Court of Appeals\nhas refused to apply general durational clauses to provi-\nsions governing retiree benefits. Having inferred that\nparties would not leave retiree benefits to the contingen-\ncies of future negotiations, and that retiree benefits gener-\nally last as long as the recipient remains a retiree, the\ncourt in Yard-Man explicitly concluded that these infer-\nences “outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived\nfrom a routine duration clause terminating the agreement\ngenerally.” 716 F. 2d, at 1482–1483. The court’s subse-\nquent decisions went even further, requiring a contract to\ninclude a specific durational clause for retiree health care\nbenefits to prevent vesting. E.g., Noe, supra, at 555.\nThese decisions distort the text of the agreement and\nconflict with the principle of contract law that the written\nagreement is presumed to encompass the whole agreement\nof the parties. See 1 W. Story, Law of Contracts §780 (M.\nBigelow ed., 5th ed. 1874); see also 11 Williston §31:5.\n   Perhaps tugged by these inferences, the Court of Ap-\npeals misapplied other traditional principles of contract\nlaw, including the illusory promises doctrine. That doc-\ntrine instructs courts to avoid constructions of contracts\nthat would render promises illusory because such promises\ncannot serve as consideration for a contract. See 3\nWilliston §7:7 (4th ed. 2008). But the Court of Appeals\nconstrued provisions that admittedly benefited some class\nof retirees as “illusory” merely because they did not equally\nbenefit all retirees. See Yard-Man, supra, at 1480–\n1481. That interpretation is a contradiction in terms—a\npromise that is “partly” illusory is by definition not illusory.\nIf it benefits some class of retirees, then it may serve\nas consideration for the union’s promises. And the court’s\ninterpretation is particularly inappropriate in the context\nof collective-bargaining agreements, which are negotiated\non behalf of a broad category of individuals and conse-\nquently will often include provisions inapplicable to some\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncategory of employees.\n   The Court of Appeals also failed even to consider the\ntraditional principle that courts should not construe am-\nbiguous writings to create lifetime promises. See 3 A.\nCorbin, Corbin on Contracts §553, p. 216 (1960) (explain-\ning that contracts that are silent as to their duration will\nordinarily be treated not as “operative in perpetuity” but\nas “operative for a reasonable time” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). The court recognized that “traditional\nrules of contractual interpretation require a clear manifes-\ntation of intent before conferring a benefit or obligation,”\nbut asserted that “the duration of the benefit once clearly\nconferred is [not] subject to this stricture.” Yard-Man,\nsupra, at 1481, n. 2. In stark contrast to this assertion,\nhowever, the court later applied that very stricture to\nnoncollectively bargained contracts offering retiree bene-\nfits. See Sprague v. General Motors Corp., 133 F. 3d 388,\n400 (CA6 1998) (“To vest benefits is to render them forever\nunalterable. Because vesting of welfare plan benefits is\nnot required by law, an employer’s commitment to vest\nsuch benefits is not to be inferred lightly; the intent to vest\nmust be found in the plan documents and must be stated\nin clear and express language” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). The different treatment of these two types of\nemployment contracts only underscores Yard-Man’s devia-\ntion from ordinary principles of contract law.\n   Similarly, the Court of Appeals failed to consider the\ntraditional principle that “contractual obligations will\ncease, in the ordinary course, upon termination of the\nbargaining agreement.” Litton Financial Printing Div.,\nLitton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 207\n(1991). That principle does not preclude the conclusion\nthat the parties intended to vest lifetime benefits for\nretirees. Indeed, we have already recognized that “a\ncollective-bargaining agreement [may] provid[e] in explicit\nterms that certain benefits continue after the agreement’s\n14          M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpiration.” Ibid. But when a contract is silent as to the\nduration of retiree benefits, a court may not infer that the\nparties intended those benefits to vest for life.\n                               C\n   There is no doubt that Yard-Man and its progeny af-\nfected the outcome here. As in its previous decisions, the\nCourt of Appeals here cited the “context of . . . labor-\nmanagement negotiations” and reasoned that the Union\nlikely would not have agreed to language ensuring its\nmembers a “full Company contribution” if the company\ncould change the level of that contribution. Tackett I, 561\nF. 3d, at 490 (internal quotation marks omitted). It simi-\nlarly concluded that the tying of eligibility for health care\nbenefits to receipt of pension benefits suggested an intent\nto vest health care benefits. Ibid. And it framed its anal-\nysis from beginning to end in light of the principles it\nannounced in Yard-Man and its progeny. See 561 F. 3d,\nat 489; see also Tackett II, 733 F. 3d, at 599–600.\n   We reject the Yard-Man inferences as inconsistent with\nordinary principles of contract law. But because “[t]his\nCourt is one of final review, not of first view,” Ford Motor\nCo. v. United States, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (per curiam)\n(slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted), the\nCourt of Appeals should be the first to review the agree-\nments at issue under the correct legal principles. We\nvacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand\nthe case for that court to apply ordinary principles of\ncontract law in the first instance.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Under\nthe “cardinal principle” of contract interpretation, “the\nintention of the parties, to be gathered from the whole\ninstrument, must prevail.” 11 R. Lord, Williston on Con-\ntracts §30:2, p. 27 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston). To determine\nwhat the contracting parties intended, a court must exam-\nine the entire agreement in light of relevant industry-\nspecific “customs, practices, usages, and terminology.” Id.,\n§30:4, at 55–58. When the intent of the parties is unam-\nbiguously expressed in the contract, that expression con-\ntrols, and the court’s inquiry should proceed no further.\nId., §30:6, at 98–104. But when the contract is ambigu-\nous, a court may consider extrinsic evidence to determine\nthe intentions of the parties. Id., §30:7, at 116–124.\n  Contrary to M&G’s assertion, Brief for Petitioner 25, no\nrule requires “clear and express” language in order to\nshow that parties intended health-care benefits to vest.\n“[C]onstraints upon the employer after the expiration date\nof a collective-bargaining agreement,” we have observed,\n2           M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v.

Because the retirees have a vested, life-\ntime right to a monthly pension, App. 366, a provision\nstating that retirees “will receive” health-care benefits if\nthey are “receiving a monthly pension” is relevant to this\nexamination. Id., at 415. So is a “survivor benefits” clause\ninstructing that if a retiree dies, her surviving spouse will\n“continue to receive [the retiree’s health-care] benefits . . .\nuntil death or remarriage.” Id., at 417. If, after consider-\ning all relevant contractual language in light of industry\npractices, the Court of Appeals concludes that the contract\nis ambiguous, it may turn to extrinsic evidence—for ex-\nample, the parties’ bargaining history. The Court of Ap-\npeals, however, must conduct the foregoing inspection\nwithout Yard-Man’s “thumb on the scale in favor of vested\nretiree benefits.” Ante, at 10; see International Union,\nUnited Auto, Aerospace, & Agricultural Implement Work-\ners of Am. v.

Argued November 10, 2014—Decided January 26, 2015\nWhen petitioner M&G Polymers USA, LLC (M&G), purchased the\n Point Pleasant Polyester Plant in 2000, it entered a collective-\n bargaining agreement and related Pension, Insurance, and Service\n Award Agreement (P & I agreement) with respondent union. As rel-\n evant here, the P & I agreement provided that certain retirees, along\n with their surviving spouses and dependents, would “receive a full\n Company contribution towards the cost of [health care] benefits”;\n that such benefits would be provided “for the duration of [the]\n Agreement”; and that the agreement would be subject to renegotia-\n tion in three years.\n    Following the expiration of those agreements, M&G announced\n that it would require retirees to contribute to the cost of their health\n care benefits. Respondent retirees, on behalf of themselves and oth-\n ers similarly situated, sued M&G and related entities, alleging that\n the P & I agreement created a vested right to lifetime contribution-\n free health care benefits.\n    The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a\n claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed based on the reasoning of its\n earlier decision in International Union, United Auto, Aerospace, &\n Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Yard-Man, Inc., 716 F. 2d\n 1476. On remand, the District Court ruled in favor of the retirees,\n and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit’s decision rested on principles that are incom-\n patible with ordinary principles of contract law. Pp. 5–14.\n    (a) The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)\n governs pension and welfare benefits plans, including those estab-\n lished by collective-bargaining agreements. ERISA establishes min-\n imum funding and vesting standards for pension plans, but exempts\n2               M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    welfare benefits plans—which provide the types of benefits at issue\n    here—from those rules. See 29 U. S. C. §§1051(1), 1053, 1081(a)(2),\n    1083. “[E]mployers have large leeway to design . . . welfare plans as\n    they see fit.” Black & Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U. S. 822,\n    833. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) This Court interprets collective-bargaining agreements, includ-\n    ing those establishing ERISA plans, according to ordinary principles\n    of contract law, at least when those principles are not inconsistent\n    with federal labor policy. See Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.,\n    353 U. S. 448, 456–457. When a collective-bargaining agreement is\n    unambiguous, its meaning must be ascertained in accordance with its\n    plainly expressed intent. 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:6, p.\n    108. P. 7.\n       (c) In Yard-Man, the Sixth Circuit found a provision governing re-\n    tiree insurance benefits ambiguous as to the duration of those bene-\n    fits; and, looking to other provisions of the agreement, purported to\n    apply ordinary contract law to resolve the ambiguity. First, the court\n    inferred from the existence of termination provisions for other bene-\n    fits that the absence of a termination provision specifically address-\n    ing retiree benefits expressed an intent to vest those benefits for life.\n    The court then purported to apply the rule that contracts should be\n    interpreted to avoid illusory promises, reasoning that, absent vesting,\n    the promise would be illusory for the subset of retirees who would not\n    become eligible for those benefits before the contract expired. Final-\n    ly, the court relied on “the context” of labor negotiations to resolve\n    the ambiguity, inferring that the parties would have intended such\n    benefits to vest for life because they are not mandatory subjects of\n    collective bargaining; are “typically understood as a form of delayed\n    compensation,” 716 F. 2d, at 1482; and are keyed to the acquisition of\n    retirement status. The court concluded that these contextual clues\n    “outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived from a routine dura-\n    tion clause.” Id., at 1483. The Sixth Circuit has since extended its\n    Yard-Man analysis in a series of other cases. Pp. 7–10.\n       (d) The inferences applied in Yard-Man and its progeny do not rep-\n    resent ordinary principles of contract law. Yard-Man distorts the at-\n    tempt to ascertain the intention of the parties by placing a thumb on\n    the scale in favor of vested retiree benefits in all collective-bargaining\n    agreements. Rather than relying on known customs and usages in a\n    particular industry as proven by the parties, the Yard-Man court re-\n    lied on its own suppositions about the intentions of parties negotiat-\n    ing retiree benefits. It then compounded the error by applying those\n    suppositions indiscriminately across industries. Furthermore, the\n    Sixth Circuit’s refusal to apply general durational clauses to provi-\n    sions governing retiree benefits distorts an agreement’s text and con-\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  flicts with the principle that a written agreement is presumed to en-\n  compass the whole agreement of the parties.\n     Perhaps tugged by its inferences, the Sixth Circuit also misapplied\n  the illusory promises doctrine. It construed provisions that admitted-\n  ly benefited some class of retirees as “illusory” merely because they\n  did not benefit all retirees. That interpretation is a contradiction in\n  terms—a promise that is “partly illusory” is by definition not illusory.\n  And its use of this doctrine is particularly inappropriate in the con-\n  text of collective-bargaining agreements, which often include provi-\n  sions inapplicable to some category of employees.\n     The Sixth Circuit also failed even to consider other traditional con-\n  tract principles, including the rule that courts should not construe\n  ambiguous writings to create lifetime promises and the rule that\n  “contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, upon ter-\n  mination of the bargaining agreement,” Litton Financial Printing\n  Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 207.\n  Pp. 10–14.\n     (e) Though there is no doubt that Yard-Man and its progeny affect-\n  ed the outcome here, the Sixth Circuit should be the first to review\n  the agreements under ordinary principles of contract law.

Yard-Man,\nInc., 716 F. 2d 1476, 1479 (1983), that retiree health care\nbenefits are unlikely to be left up to future negotiations.\nWe granted certiorari and now conclude that such reason-\ning is incompatible with ordinary principles of contract\nlaw. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand for it to apply ordinary principles of\ncontract law in the first instance.\n2          M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   Respondents Hobert Freel Tackett, Woodrow K. Pyles,\nand Harlan B. Conley worked at (and retired from) the\nPoint Pleasant Polyester Plant in Apple Grove, West\nVirginia (hereinafter referred to as the Plant). During\ntheir employment, respondent United Steel, Paper and\nForestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Indus-\ntrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO-\nCLC, or its predecessor unions (hereinafter referred to as\nthe Union), represented them in collective bargaining.\nTackett and Pyles retired in 1996, and Conley retired in\n1998. They represent a class of retired employees from\nthe Plant, along with their surviving spouses and other\ndependents. Petitioner M&G Polymers USA, LLC, is the\ncurrent owner of the Plant.\n   When M&G purchased the Plant in 2000, it entered a\nmaster collective-bargaining agreement and a Pension,\nInsurance, and Service Award Agreement (P & I agree-\nment) with the Union, generally similar to agreements the\nUnion had negotiated with M&G’s predecessor. The P & I\nagreement provided for retiree health care benefits as\nfollows:\n    “Employees who retire on or after January 1, 1996\n    and who are eligible for and receiving a monthly pen-\n    sion under the 1993 Pension Plan . . . whose full years\n    of attained age and full years of attained continuous\n    service . . . at the time of retirement equals 95 or more\n    points will receive a full Company contribution to-\n    wards the cost of [health care] benefits described in\n    this Exhibit B–1 . . . .

Failure to pay\n     the required medical contribution will result in can-\n     cellation of coverage.” App. 415–416.\nExhibit B–1, which described the health care benefits at\nissue, opened with the following durational clause: “Effec-\ntive January 1, 1998, and for the duration of this Agree-\nment thereafter, the Employer will provide the following\nprogram of hospital benefits, hospital-medical benefits,\nsurgical benefits and prescription drug benefits for eligible\nemployees and their dependents . . . . ” Id., at 377–378\n(emphasis deleted). The P & I agreement provided for\nrenegotiation of its terms in three years.1\n                             B\n  In December 2006, M&G announced that it would begin\nrequiring retirees to contribute to the cost of their health\ncare benefits. Respondent retirees, on behalf of them-\nselves and others similarly situated, sued M&G and re-\nlated entities, alleging that the decision to require these\ncontributions breached both the collective-bargaining\nagreement and the P & I agreement, in violation of §301 of\nthe Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA) and\n§502(a)(1)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 891.2 Specifically, the retir-\nees alleged that M&G had promised to provide lifetime\ncontribution-free health care benefits for them, their\nsurviving spouses, and their dependents. They pointed to\n——————\n  1 In accordance with this provision, M&G and the Union began bar-\n\ngaining anew in 2003, ultimately reaching a new agreement in 2005.\nThe provisions of the existing agreements remained in effect during the\ncourse of those negotiations. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 25, n. 1.\n  2 The Union was a plaintiff in the suit and is a respondent here. For\n\nease of reference, we refer to the respondents collectively as “the\nretirees.”\n4           M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe language in the 2000 P & I agreement providing that\nemployees with a certain level of seniority “will receive a\nfull Company contribution towards the cost of [health\ncare] benefits described in . . . Exhibit B–1.” The retirees\nalleged that, with this promise, M&G had created a vested\nright to such benefits that continued beyond the expiration\nof the 2000 P & I agreement.\n   The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to\nstate a claim. 523 F. Supp. 2d 684, 696 (SD Ohio 2007). It\nconcluded that the cited language unambiguously did not\ncreate a vested right to retiree benefits.\n   The Court of Appeals reversed based on the reasoning of\nits earlier decision in Yard-Man. 561 F. 3d 478 (CA6\n2009) (Tackett I). Yard-Man involved a similar claim that\nan employer had breached a collective-bargaining agree-\nment when it terminated retiree benefits. 716 F. 2d, at\n1478. Although the court found the text of the provision in\nthat case ambiguous, it relied on the “context” of labor\nnegotiations to resolve that ambiguity in favor of the\nretirees’ interpretation. Id., at 1482. Specifically, the\ncourt inferred that parties to collective bargaining would\nintend retiree benefits to vest for life because such benefits\nare “not mandatory” or required to be included in collective-\nbargaining agreements, are “typically understood as a\nform of delayed compensation or reward for past services,”\nand are keyed to the acquisition of retirement status.\nIbid. The court concluded that these inferences “out-\nweigh[ed] any contrary implications [about the termina-\ntion of retiree benefits] derived from” general termination\nclauses. Id., at 1483.\n   Applying the Yard-Man inferences on review of the\nDistrict Court’s dismissal of the action, the Court of Ap-\npeals concluded that the retirees had stated a plausible\nclaim. Tackett I, 561 F. 3d, at 490. “Keeping in mind the\ncontext of the labor-management negotiations identified in\nYard-Man,” the court found “it unlikely that [the Union]\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould agree to language that ensures its members a ‘full\nCompany contribution,’ if the company could unilaterally\nchange the level of contribution.” Ibid. The court con-\nstrued the language about “employees” contributing to\ntheir health care premiums as limited to employees who\nhad not attained the requisite seniority points to be enti-\ntled to a full company contribution. Ibid. And it discerned\nan intent to vest lifetime contribution-free health care\nbenefits from provisions tying eligibility for health care\nbenefits to eligibility for pension benefits. Id., at 490–491.\n   On remand, the District Court conducted a bench trial\nand ruled in favor of the retirees. It declined to revisit the\nquestion whether the P & I agreement created a vested\nright to retiree benefits, concluding that the Court of\nAppeals had definitively resolved that issue. It then\nissued a permanent injunction ordering M&G to reinstate\ncontribution-free health care benefits for the individual\nrespondents and similarly situated retirees. 853 F. Supp.\n2d 697 (SD Ohio 2012).\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that, al-\nthough the District Court had erred in treating Tackett I as\na conclusive resolution of the meaning of the P & I agree-\nment, it had not erred in “presum[ing]” that, “in the ab-\nsence of extrinsic evidence to the contrary, the agreements\nindicated an intent to vest lifetime contribution-free bene-\nfits.” 733 F. 3d 589, 600 (CA6 2013) (Tackett II). And\nbecause the District Court had concluded that the prof-\nfered extrinsic evidence was inapplicable, it had not clearly\nerred in finding that the agreement created those vested\nrights.\n   We granted certiorari, 572 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\nvacate and remand.\n                          II\n  This case is about the interpretation of collective-\nbargaining agreements that define rights to welfare bene-\n6           M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfits plans. The LMRA grants federal courts jurisdiction to\nresolve disputes between employers and labor unions\nabout collective-bargaining agreements. 29 U. S. C. §185.\nWhen collective-bargaining agreements create pension or\nwelfare benefits plans, those plans are subject to rules\nestablished in ERISA. ERISA defines pension plans as\nplans, funds, or programs that “provid[e] retirement in-\ncome to employees” or that “resul[t] in a deferral of in-\ncome.” §1002(2)(A). It defines welfare benefits plans as\nplans, funds, or programs established or maintained to\nprovide participants with additional benefits, such as life\ninsurance and disability coverage. §1002(1).\n   ERISA treats these two types of plans differently.\nAlthough ERISA imposes elaborate minimum funding and\nvesting standards for pension plans, §§1053, 1082, 1083,\n1084, it explicitly exempts welfare benefits plans from\nthose rules, §§1051(1), 1081(a)(1). Welfare benefits plans\nmust be “established and maintained pursuant to a writ-\nten instrument,” §1102(a)(1), but “[e]mployers or other\nplan sponsors are generally free under ERISA, for any\nreason at any time, to adopt, modify, or terminate welfare\nplans,” Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U. S.\n73, 78 (1995).        As we have previously recognized,\n“[E]mployers have large leeway to design disability and\nother welfare plans as they see fit.” Black & Decker Dis-\nability Plan v. Nord, 538 U. S. 822, 833 (2003). And, we\nhave observed, the rule that contractual “provisions ordi-\nnarily should be enforced as written is especially appro-\npriate when enforcing an ERISA [welfare benefits] plan.”\nHeimeshoff v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 571 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 7). That is because the “focus\non the written terms of the plan is the linchpin of a system\nthat is not so complex that administrative costs, or litiga-\ntion expenses, unduly discourage employers from offering\n[welfare benefits] plans in the first place.” Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 8) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nomitted).\n  We interpret collective-bargaining agreements, includ-\ning those establishing ERISA plans, according to ordinary\nprinciples of contract law, at least when those principles\nare not inconsistent with federal labor policy. See Textile\nWorkers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 456–457\n(1957). “In this endeavor, as with any other contract, the\nparties’ intentions control.” Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. Animal-\nFeeds Int’l Corp., 559 U. S. 662, 682 (2010) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted). “Where the words of a contract in\nwriting are clear and unambiguous, its meaning is to be\nascertained in accordance with its plainly expressed in-\ntent.” 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:6, p. 108 (4th\ned. 2012) (Williston) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  In this case, the Court of Appeals applied the Yard-Man\ninferences to conclude that, in the absence of extrinsic\nevidence to the contrary, the provisions of the contract\nindicated an intent to vest retirees with lifetime benefits.\nTackett II, 733 F. 3d, at 599–600. As we now explain,\nthose inferences conflict with ordinary principles of con-\ntract law.\n                            III\n                             A\n                             1\n  The Court of Appeals has long insisted that its Yard-\nMan inferences are drawn from ordinary contract law. In\nYard-Man itself, the court purported to apply “traditional\nrules for contractual interpretation.” 716 F. 2d, at 1479.\nThe court first concluded that the provision governing\nretiree insurance benefits—which stated only that the\nemployer “will provide” such benefits—was ambiguous as\nto the duration of those benefits. Id., at 1480. To resolve\nthat ambiguity, it looked to other provisions of the agree-\nment. The agreement included provisions for terminating\nactive employees’ insurance benefits in the case of layoffs\n8           M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand for terminating benefits for a retiree’s spouse and\ndependents in case of the retiree’s death before the expira-\ntion of the collective-bargaining agreement, but no provi-\nsion specifically addressed the duration of retiree health\ncare benefits. Id., at 1481–1482. From the existence of\nthese termination provisions and the absence of a termi-\nnation provision specifically addressing retiree benefits,\nthe court inferred an intent to vest those retiree benefits\nfor life.\n    The court then purported to apply the rule that con-\ntracts should be interpreted to avoid illusory promises. It\nnoted that the retiree insurance provisions “contain[ed] a\npromise that the company will pay an early retiree’s in-\nsurance upon such retiree reaching age 65 but that the\nretiree must bear the cost of company insurance until that\ntime.” Id., at 1481. Employees could retire at age 55, but\nthe agreement containing this promise applied only for a\n3-year term. Ibid. Thus, retirees between the ages of 55\nand 62 would not turn 65 and become eligible for the\ncompany contribution before the 3-year agreement ex-\npired. In light of this fact, the court reasoned that the\npromise would be “completely illusory for many early\nretirees under age 62” if the retiree benefits terminated\nwhen the contract expired. Ibid.\n    Finally, the court turned to “the context” of labor nego-\ntiations. Id., at 1482. It observed that “[b]enefits for\nretirees are . . . not mandatory subjects of collective bar-\ngaining” and that “employees are presumably aware that\nthe union owes no obligation to bargain for continued\nbenefits for retirees.” Ibid. Based on these observations,\nthe court concluded that “it is unlikely that such benefits\n. . . would be left to the contingencies of future negotia-\ntions.” Ibid. It also asserted that “retiree benefits are in a\nsense ‘status’ benefits which, as such, carry with them an\ninference that they continue so long as the prerequisite\nstatus is maintained.” Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Although the contract included a general durational\nclause—meaning that the contract itself would expire at a\nset time—the court concluded that these contextual clues\n“outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived from a\nroutine duration clause.” Id., at 1483.\n                               2\n   Two years after Yard-Man, the court took this analysis\neven further. In a dispute between retirees and a steel\ncompany over retiree health insurance benefits, it con-\nstrued the language “will continue to provide at its ex-\npense, supplemental medicare and major medical benefits\nfor Pensioners aged 65 and over” to “unambiguously con-\nfe[r]” lifetime benefits. Policy v. Powell Pressed Steel Co.,\n770 F. 2d 609, 615 (CA6 1985) (emphasis added). Yet it\nhad interpreted similar language—“will provide insurance\nbenefits equal to the active group”—to be ambiguous in\nYard-Man. The court refused to give any weight to provi-\nsions that supported a contrary construction—namely, one\nestablishing a fund to pay pension, but not welfare, bene-\nfits, and another providing for the continuation of pension,\nbut not welfare, benefits after the agreement expired.\nPolicy, 770 F. 2d, at 615–616. According to the court, a\ncontrary interpretation “would render the Company’s\npromise [of benefits for retirees aged 65 and over] in sub-\nstantial part nugatory and illusory” to retirees who were\n62 or younger when the 3-year agreement was signed.\nIbid. And it faulted the District Court for failing “to give\neffect” to Yard-Man’s admonition “that retiree benefits\nnormally . . . are interminable.” 770 F. 2d, at 616.\n   The Court of Appeals has continued to extend the rea-\nsoning of Yard-Man. Relying on Yard-Man’s statement\nthat context considerations outweigh the effect of a gen-\neral termination clause, it has concluded that, “ ‘[a]bsent\nspecific durational language referring to retiree benefits\nthemselves,’ a general durational clause says nothing\n10          M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nabout the vesting of retiree benefits.” Noe v. PolyOne\nCorp., 520 F. 3d 548, 555 (CA6 2008) (emphasis added). It\nhas also held that a provision that “ties eligibility for\nretirement-health benefits to eligibility for a pension . . .\n[leaves] little room for debate that retirees’ health benefits\nves[t] upon retirement.” Id., at 558 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Commenting on these extensions of\nYard-Man, the court has acknowledged that “there is a\nreasonable argument to be made that, while th[e] court\nhas repeatedly cautioned that Yard-Man does not create a\npresumption of vesting, [it] ha[s] gone on to apply just\nsuch a presumption.” Cole v. ArvinMeritor, Inc., 549 F. 3d\n1064, 1074 (CA6 2008).\n                              B\n   We disagree with the Court of Appeals’ assessment that\nthe inferences applied in Yard-Man and its progeny repre-\nsent ordinary principles of contract law.\n   As an initial matter, Yard-Man violates ordinary con-\ntract principles by placing a thumb on the scale in favor of\nvested retiree benefits in all collective-bargaining agree-\nments. That rule has no basis in ordinary principles of\ncontract law. And it distorts the attempt “to ascertain the\nintention of the parties.” 11 Williston §30:2, at 18 (empha-\nsis added); see also Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at 682. Yard-\nMan’s assessment of likely behavior in collective bargain-\ning is too speculative and too far removed from the context\nof any particular contract to be useful in discerning the\nparties’ intention.\n   And the Court of Appeals derived its assessment of\nlikely behavior not from record evidence, but instead from\nits own suppositions about the intentions of employees,\nunions, and employers negotiating retiree benefits. See\nYard-Man, 716 F. 2d, at 1482. For example, it asserted,\nwithout any foundation, that, “when . . . parties contract\nfor benefits which accrue upon achievement of retiree\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)              11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nstatus, there is an inference that the parties likely in-\ntended those benefits to continue as long as the benefi-\nciary remains a retiree.” Ibid.; see also ibid. (“[I]t is unlikely\nthat [retiree] benefits . . . would be left to the contingen-\ncies of future negotiations”). Although a court may look to\nknown customs or usages in a particular industry to de-\ntermine the meaning of a contract, the parties must prove\nthose customs or usages using affirmative evidentiary\nsupport in a given case. 12 Williston §34:3; accord, Robin-\nson v. United States, 13 Wall. 363, 366 (1872); Oelricks v.\nFord, 23 How. 49, 61–62 (1860). Yard-Man relied on no\nrecord evidence indicating that employers and unions in\nthat industry customarily vest retiree benefits. Worse, the\nCourt of Appeals has taken the inferences in Yard-Man\nand applied them indiscriminately across industries. See,\ne.g., Cole, supra, at 1074 (automobile); Armistead v. Ver-\nnitron Corp., 944 F. 2d 1287, 1297 (CA6 1991) (electron-\nics); Policy, supra, at 618 (steel).\n   Because the Court of Appeals did not ground its Yard-\nMan inferences in any record evidence, it is unsurprising\nthat the inferences rest on a shaky factual foundation.\nFor example, Yard-Man relied in part on the premise that\nretiree health care benefits are not subjects of mandatory\ncollective bargaining. Parties, however, can and do volun-\ntarily agree to make retiree benefits a subject of mandato-\nry collective bargaining. Indeed, the employer and union\nin this case entered such an agreement in 2001. App.\n435–436. Yard-Man also relied on the premise that re-\ntiree benefits are a form of deferred compensation, but\nthat characterization is contrary to Congress’ determi-\nnation otherwise. In ERISA, Congress specifically defined\nplans that “resul[t] in a deferral of income by employ-\nees” as pension plans, §1002(2)(A)(ii), and plans that offer\nmedical benefits as welfare plans, §1002(1)(A). Thus,\nretiree health care benefits are not a form of deferred\ncompensation.\n12          M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Further compounding this error, the Court of Appeals\nhas refused to apply general durational clauses to provi-\nsions governing retiree benefits. Having inferred that\nparties would not leave retiree benefits to the contingen-\ncies of future negotiations, and that retiree benefits gener-\nally last as long as the recipient remains a retiree, the\ncourt in Yard-Man explicitly concluded that these infer-\nences “outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived\nfrom a routine duration clause terminating the agreement\ngenerally.” 716 F. 2d, at 1482–1483. The court’s subse-\nquent decisions went even further, requiring a contract to\ninclude a specific durational clause for retiree health care\nbenefits to prevent vesting. E.g., Noe, supra, at 555.\nThese decisions distort the text of the agreement and\nconflict with the principle of contract law that the written\nagreement is presumed to encompass the whole agreement\nof the parties. See 1 W. Story, Law of Contracts §780 (M.\nBigelow ed., 5th ed. 1874); see also 11 Williston §31:5.\n   Perhaps tugged by these inferences, the Court of Ap-\npeals misapplied other traditional principles of contract\nlaw, including the illusory promises doctrine. That doc-\ntrine instructs courts to avoid constructions of contracts\nthat would render promises illusory because such promises\ncannot serve as consideration for a contract. See 3\nWilliston §7:7 (4th ed. 2008). But the Court of Appeals\nconstrued provisions that admittedly benefited some class\nof retirees as “illusory” merely because they did not equally\nbenefit all retirees. See Yard-Man, supra, at 1480–\n1481. That interpretation is a contradiction in terms—a\npromise that is “partly” illusory is by definition not illusory.\nIf it benefits some class of retirees, then it may serve\nas consideration for the union’s promises. And the court’s\ninterpretation is particularly inappropriate in the context\nof collective-bargaining agreements, which are negotiated\non behalf of a broad category of individuals and conse-\nquently will often include provisions inapplicable to some\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncategory of employees.\n   The Court of Appeals also failed even to consider the\ntraditional principle that courts should not construe am-\nbiguous writings to create lifetime promises. See 3 A.\nCorbin, Corbin on Contracts §553, p. 216 (1960) (explain-\ning that contracts that are silent as to their duration will\nordinarily be treated not as “operative in perpetuity” but\nas “operative for a reasonable time” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). The court recognized that “traditional\nrules of contractual interpretation require a clear manifes-\ntation of intent before conferring a benefit or obligation,”\nbut asserted that “the duration of the benefit once clearly\nconferred is [not] subject to this stricture.” Yard-Man,\nsupra, at 1481, n. 2. In stark contrast to this assertion,\nhowever, the court later applied that very stricture to\nnoncollectively bargained contracts offering retiree bene-\nfits. See Sprague v. General Motors Corp., 133 F. 3d 388,\n400 (CA6 1998) (“To vest benefits is to render them forever\nunalterable. Because vesting of welfare plan benefits is\nnot required by law, an employer’s commitment to vest\nsuch benefits is not to be inferred lightly; the intent to vest\nmust be found in the plan documents and must be stated\nin clear and express language” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). The different treatment of these two types of\nemployment contracts only underscores Yard-Man’s devia-\ntion from ordinary principles of contract law.\n   Similarly, the Court of Appeals failed to consider the\ntraditional principle that “contractual obligations will\ncease, in the ordinary course, upon termination of the\nbargaining agreement.” Litton Financial Printing Div.,\nLitton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 207\n(1991). That principle does not preclude the conclusion\nthat the parties intended to vest lifetime benefits for\nretirees. Indeed, we have already recognized that “a\ncollective-bargaining agreement [may] provid[e] in explicit\nterms that certain benefits continue after the agreement’s\n14          M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpiration.” Ibid. But when a contract is silent as to the\nduration of retiree benefits, a court may not infer that the\nparties intended those benefits to vest for life.\n                               C\n   There is no doubt that Yard-Man and its progeny af-\nfected the outcome here. As in its previous decisions, the\nCourt of Appeals here cited the “context of . . . labor-\nmanagement negotiations” and reasoned that the Union\nlikely would not have agreed to language ensuring its\nmembers a “full Company contribution” if the company\ncould change the level of that contribution. Tackett I, 561\nF. 3d, at 490 (internal quotation marks omitted). It simi-\nlarly concluded that the tying of eligibility for health care\nbenefits to receipt of pension benefits suggested an intent\nto vest health care benefits. Ibid. And it framed its anal-\nysis from beginning to end in light of the principles it\nannounced in Yard-Man and its progeny. See 561 F. 3d,\nat 489; see also Tackett II, 733 F. 3d, at 599–600.\n   We reject the Yard-Man inferences as inconsistent with\nordinary principles of contract law. But because “[t]his\nCourt is one of final review, not of first view,” Ford Motor\nCo. v. United States, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (per curiam)\n(slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted), the\nCourt of Appeals should be the first to review the agree-\nments at issue under the correct legal principles. We\nvacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand\nthe case for that court to apply ordinary principles of\ncontract law in the first instance.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Under\nthe “cardinal principle” of contract interpretation, “the\nintention of the parties, to be gathered from the whole\ninstrument, must prevail.” 11 R. Lord, Williston on Con-\ntracts §30:2, p. 27 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston). To determine\nwhat the contracting parties intended, a court must exam-\nine the entire agreement in light of relevant industry-\nspecific “customs, practices, usages, and terminology.” Id.,\n§30:4, at 55–58. When the intent of the parties is unam-\nbiguously expressed in the contract, that expression con-\ntrols, and the court’s inquiry should proceed no further.\nId., §30:6, at 98–104. But when the contract is ambigu-\nous, a court may consider extrinsic evidence to determine\nthe intentions of the parties. Id., §30:7, at 116–124.\n  Contrary to M&G’s assertion, Brief for Petitioner 25, no\nrule requires “clear and express” language in order to\nshow that parties intended health-care benefits to vest.\n“[C]onstraints upon the employer after the expiration date\nof a collective-bargaining agreement,” we have observed,\n2           M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC v. TACKETT\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., concurring\n\nmay be derived from the agreement’s “explicit terms,” but\nthey “may arise as well from . . . implied terms of the\nexpired agreement.” Litton Financial Printing Div., Litton\nBusiness Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 203, 207\n(1991).\n   On remand, the Court of Appeals should examine the\nentire agreement to determine whether the parties in-\ntended retiree health-care benefits to vest. 11 Williston\n§30:4, at 55–57. Because the retirees have a vested, life-\ntime right to a monthly pension, App. 366, a provision\nstating that retirees “will receive” health-care benefits if\nthey are “receiving a monthly pension” is relevant to this\nexamination. Id., at 415. So is a “survivor benefits” clause\ninstructing that if a retiree dies, her surviving spouse will\n“continue to receive [the retiree’s health-care] benefits . . .\nuntil death or remarriage.” Id., at 417. If, after consider-\ning all relevant contractual language in light of industry\npractices, the Court of Appeals concludes that the contract\nis ambiguous, it may turn to extrinsic evidence—for ex-\nample, the parties’ bargaining history. The Court of Ap-\npeals, however, must conduct the foregoing inspection\nwithout Yard-Man’s “thumb on the scale in favor of vested\nretiree benefits.” Ante, at 10; see International Union,\nUnited Auto, Aerospace, & Agricultural Implement Work-\ners of Am. v. Yard-Man, Inc., 716 F. 2d 1476 (1983).\n   Because I understand the Court’s opinion to be con-\nsistent with these basic rules of contract interpretation, I\njoin it.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2773182/", "sha1": "02a21a16ca66709c57d86c9574a4f3eabde47b78", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-01-26T08:01:13.664009"}
