UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 13–7451. Argued November 5, 2014—Decided February 25, 2015\nWhile conducting an offshore inspection of a commercial fishing vessel\n in the Gulf of Mexico, a federal agent found that the ship’s catch con-\n tained undersized red grouper, in violation of federal conservation\n regulations. The officer instructed the ship’s captain, petitioner\n Yates, to keep the undersized fish segregated from the rest of the\n catch until the ship returned to port. After the officer departed,\n Yates instead told a crew member to throw the undersized fish over-\n board. For this offense, Yates was charged with destroying, conceal-\n ing, and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investiga-\n tion, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1519. That section provides that a\n person may be fined or imprisoned for up to 20 years if he “knowingly\n alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a\n false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent\n to impede, obstruct, or influence” a federal investigation. At trial,\n Yates moved for a judgment of acquittal on the §1519 charge. Point-\n ing to §1519’s origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,\n a law designed to protect investors and restore trust in financial\n markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Yates argued\n that §1519’s reference to “tangible object” subsumes objects used to\n store information, such as computer hard drives, not fish. The Dis-\n trict Court denied Yates’s motion, and a jury found him guilty of vio-\n lating §1519. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction, conclud-\n ing that §1519 applies to the destruction or concealment of fish\n because, as objects having physical form, fish fall within the diction-\n ary definition of “tangible object.”\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n733 F. 3d 1059, reversed and remanded.\n2                        YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n       JUSTICE GINSBURG, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE BREYER,\n    and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded that a “tangible object” within\n    §1519’s compass is one used to record or preserve information. Pp. 6–\n    20.\n       (a) Although dictionary definitions of the words “tangible” and “ob-\n    ject” bear consideration in determining the meaning of “tangible ob-\n    ject” in §1519, they are not dispositive. Whether a statutory term is\n    unambiguous “is determined [not only] by reference to the language\n    itself, [but also by] the specific context in which that language is\n    used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.” Robinson v.\n    Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341. Identical language may convey\n    varying content when used in different statutes, sometimes even in\n    different provisions of the same statute. See, e.g., FAA v. Cooper, 566\n    U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 7–10.\n       (b) Familiar interpretive guides aid the construction of “tangible\n    object.” Though not commanding, §1519’s heading—“Destruction, al-\n    teration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and\n    bankruptcy”—conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spolia-\n    tion of any and all physical evidence, however remote from records.\n       Section 1519’s position within Title 18, Chapter 73, further signals\n    that §1519 was not intended to serve as a cross-the-board ban on the\n    destruction of physical evidence. Congress placed §1519 at the end of\n    Chapter 73 following immediately after pre-existing specialized pro-\n    visions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial audits.\n       The contemporaneous passage of §1512(c)(1), which prohibits a\n    person from “alter[ing], destroy[ing], mutilat[ing], or conceal[ing] a\n    record, document, or other object . . . with the intent to impair the ob-\n    ject’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding,” is also\n    instructive. The Government argues that §1512(c)(1)’s reference to\n    “other object” includes any and every physical object. But if §1519’s\n    reference to “tangible object” already included all physical objects, as\n    the Government also contends, then Congress had no reason to enact\n    §1512(c)(1). Section 1519 should not be read to render superfluous an\n    entire provision passed in proximity as part of the same Act. See\n    Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. ___, ___.\n       The words immediately surrounding “tangible object” in §1519—\n    “falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record [or] document”—also\n    cabin the contextual meaning of that term. Applying the canons\n    noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis, “tangible object,” as the last in\n    a list of terms that begins “any record [or] document,” is appropriate-\n    ly read to refer, not to any tangible object, but specifically to the sub-\n    set of tangible objects used to record or preserve information. This\n    moderate interpretation accords with the list of actions §1519 pro-\n    scribes; the verbs “falsif[y]” and “mak[e] a false entry in” typically\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  take as grammatical objects records, documents, or things used to\n  record or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard drives. See\n  Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575.\n     Use of traditional tools of statutory interpretation to examine\n  markers of congressional intent within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and\n  §1519 itself thus call for rejection of an aggressive interpretation of\n  “tangible object.”\n     Furthermore, the meaning of “record, document, or thing” in a pro-\n  vision of the 1962 Model Penal Code (MPC) that has been interpreted\n  to prohibit tampering with any kind of physical evidence is not a reli-\n  able indicator of the meaning Congress assigned to “record, docu-\n  ment, or tangible object” in §1519. There are significant differences\n  between the offense described by the MPC provision and the offense\n  created by §1519. Pp. 10–18.\n     (c) Finally, if recourse to traditional tools of statutory construction\n  leaves any doubt about the meaning of “tangible object” in §1519, it\n  would be appropriate to invoke the rule of lenity. Pp. 18–19.\n     JUSTICE ALITO concluded that traditional rules of statutory con-\n  struction confirm that Yates has the better argument. Title 18\n  U. S. C. §1519’s list of nouns, list of verbs, and title, when combined,\n  tip the case in favor of Yates. Applying the canons noscitur a sociis\n  and ejusdem generis to the list of nouns—“any record, document, or\n  tangible object”—the term “tangible object” should refer to something\n  similar to records or documents. And while many of §1519’s verbs—\n  “alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a\n  false entry in”—could apply to far-flung nouns such as salamanders\n  or sand dunes, the term “makes a false entry in” makes no sense out-\n  side of filekeeping. Finally, §1519’s title—“Destruction, alteration, or\n  falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy”—\n  also points toward filekeeping rather than fish.

YATES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 25, 2015]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG announced the judgment of the\nCourt and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE, JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join.\n  John Yates, a commercial fisherman, caught undersized\nred grouper in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. To\nprevent federal authorities from confirming that he had\nharvested undersized fish, Yates ordered a crew member\nto toss the suspect catch into the sea. For this offense, he\nwas charged with, and convicted of, violating 18 U. S. C.\n§1519, which provides:\n       “Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates,\n    conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in\n    any record, document, or tangible object with the in-\n    tent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation\n    or proper administration of any matter within the ju-\n    risdiction of any department or agency of the United\n    States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to\n    or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be\n    fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20\n    years, or both.”\nYates was also indicted and convicted under §2232(a),\nwhich provides:\n2                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\n      “DESTRUCTION OR REMOVAL OF PROPERTY TO\n    PREVENT SEIZURE.—Whoever, before, during, or after\n    any search for or seizure of property by any person\n    authorized to make such search or seizure, knowingly\n    destroys, damages, wastes, disposes of, transfers, or\n    otherwise takes any action, or knowingly attempts to\n    destroy, damage, waste, dispose of, transfer, or other-\n    wise take any action, for the purpose of preventing or\n    impairing the Government’s lawful authority to take\n    such property into its custody or control or to continue\n    holding such property under its lawful custody and\n    control, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned\n    not more than 5 years, or both.”\nYates does not contest his conviction for violating\n§2232(a), but he maintains that fish are not trapped\nwithin the term “tangible object,” as that term is used in\n§1519.\n   Section 1519 was enacted as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, 116 Stat. 745, legislation designed to protect\ninvestors and restore trust in financial markets following\nthe collapse of Enron Corporation. A fish is no doubt an\nobject that is tangible; fish can be seen, caught, and\nhandled, and a catch, as this case illustrates, is vulnerable\nto destruction. But it would cut §1519 loose from its\nfinancial-fraud mooring to hold that it encompasses any\nand all objects, whatever their size or significance, de-\nstroyed with obstructive intent. Mindful that in Sarbanes-\nOxley, Congress trained its attention on corporate and\naccounting deception and cover-ups, we conclude that a\nmatching construction of §1519 is in order: A tangible\nobject captured by §1519, we hold, must be one used to\nrecord or preserve information.\n                            I\n  On August 23, 2007, the Miss Katie, a commercial fish-\ning boat, was six days into an expedition in the Gulf of\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nMexico. Her crew numbered three, including Yates, the\ncaptain. Engaged in a routine offshore patrol to inspect\nboth recreational and commercial vessels, Officer John\nJones of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Com-\nmission decided to board the Miss Katie to check on the\nvessel’s compliance with fishing rules. Although the Miss\nKatie was far enough from the Florida coast to be in exclu-\nsively federal waters, she was nevertheless within Officer\nJones’s jurisdiction. Because he had been deputized as a\nfederal agent by the National Marine Fisheries Service,\nOfficer Jones had authority to enforce federal, as well as\nstate, fishing laws.\n   Upon boarding the Miss Katie, Officer Jones noticed\nthree red grouper that appeared to be undersized hanging\nfrom a hook on the deck. At the time, federal conservation\nregulations required immediate release of red grouper less\nthan 20 inches long. 50 CFR §622.37(d)(2)(ii) (effective\nApril 2, 2007). Violation of those regulations is a civil\noffense punishable by a fine or fishing license suspension.\nSee 16 U. S. C. §§1857(1)(A), (G), 1858(a), (g).\n   Suspecting that other undersized fish might be on\nboard, Officer Jones proceeded to inspect the ship’s catch,\nsetting aside and measuring only fish that appeared to\nhim to be shorter than 20 inches. Officer Jones ultimately\ndetermined that 72 fish fell short of the 20-inch mark. A\nfellow officer recorded the length of each of the undersized\nfish on a catch measurement verification form. With few\nexceptions, the measured fish were between 19 and 20\ninches; three were less than 19 inches; none were less\nthan 18.75 inches. After separating the fish measuring\nbelow 20 inches from the rest of the catch by placing them\nin wooden crates, Officer Jones directed Yates to leave the\nfish, thus segregated, in the crates until the Miss Katie\nreturned to port. Before departing, Officer Jones issued\nYates a citation for possession of undersized fish.\n   Four days later, after the Miss Katie had docked in\n4                    YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nCortez, Florida, Officer Jones measured the fish contained\nin the wooden crates. This time, however, the measured\nfish, although still less than 20 inches, slightly exceeded\nthe lengths recorded on board. Jones surmised that the\nfish brought to port were not the same as those he had\ndetected during his initial inspection. Under questioning,\none of the crew members admitted that, at Yates’s direc-\ntion, he had thrown overboard the fish Officer Jones had\nmeasured at sea, and that he and Yates had replaced the\ntossed grouper with fish from the rest of the catch.\n   For reasons not disclosed in the record before us, more\nthan 32 months passed before criminal charges were\nlodged against Yates. On May 5, 2010, he was indicted for\ndestroying property to prevent a federal seizure, in viola-\ntion of §2232(a), and for destroying, concealing, and cover-\ning up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation, in\nviolation of §1519.1 By the time of the indictment, the\nminimum legal length for Gulf red grouper had been\nlowered from 20 inches to 18 inches. See 50 CFR\n§622.37(d)(2)(iv) (effective May 18, 2009). No measured\nfish in Yates’s catch fell below that limit. The record does\nnot reveal what civil penalty, if any, Yates received for his\npossession of fish undersized under the 2007 regulation.\nSee 16 U. S. C. §1858(a).\n   Yates was tried on the criminal charges in August 2011.\nAt the end of the Government’s case in chief, he moved for\na judgment of acquittal on the §1519 charge. Pointing to\n§1519’s title and its origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act, Yates argued that the section sets forth “a\ndocuments offense” and that its reference to “tangible\nobject[s]” subsumes “computer hard drives, logbooks, [and]\nthings of that nature,” not fish. App. 91–92. Yates\n——————\n  1 Yates was also charged with making a false statement to federal law\n\nenforcement officers, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1001(a)(2). That\ncharge, on which Yates was acquitted, is not relevant to our analysis.\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)               5\n\n                      Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nacknowledged that the Criminal Code contains “sections\nthat would have been appropriate for the [G]overnment to\npursue” if it wished to prosecute him for tampering with\nevidence. App. 91. Section 2232(a), set out supra, at 1–2,\nfit that description. But §1519, Yates insisted, did not.\n   The Government countered that a “tangible object”\nwithin §1519’s compass is “simply something other than a\ndocument or record.” App. 93. The trial judge expressed\nmisgivings about reading “tangible object” as broadly as\nthe Government urged: “Isn’t there a Latin phrase [about]\nconstruction of a statute . . . . The gist of it is . . . you take\na look at [a] line of words, and you interpret the words\nconsistently. So if you’re talking about documents, and\nrecords, tangible objects are tangible objects in the nature\nof a document or a record, as opposed to a fish.” Ibid. The\nfirst-instance judge nonetheless followed controlling Elev-\nenth Circuit precedent. While recognizing that §1519 was\npassed as part of legislation targeting corporate fraud, the\nCourt of Appeals had instructed that “the broad language\nof §1519 is not limited to corporate fraud cases, and ‘Con-\ngress is free to pass laws with language covering areas\nwell beyond the particular crisis du jour that initially\nprompted legislative action.’ ”       No. 2:10–cr–66–FtM–\n29SPC (MD Fla., Aug. 8, 2011), App. 116 (quoting United\nStates v. Hunt, 526 F. 3d 739, 744 (CA11 2008)). Accord-\ningly, the trial court read “tangible object” as a term “in-\ndependent” of “record” or “document.” App. 116. For\nviolating §1519 and §2232(a), the court sentenced Yates to\nimprisonment for 30 days, followed by supervised release\nfor three years. App. 118–120. For life, he will bear the\nstigma of having a federal felony conviction.\n   On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit found the text of §1519\n“plain.” 733 F. 3d 1059, 1064 (2013). Because “tangible\nobject” was “undefined” in the statute, the Court of Ap-\npeals gave the term its “ordinary or natural meaning,” i.e.,\nits dictionary definition, “[h]aving or possessing physical\n6                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nform.” Ibid. (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 1592 (9th ed.\n2009)).\n  We granted certiorari, 572 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\nreverse the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment.\n                              II\n   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the\nexposure of Enron’s massive accounting fraud and revela-\ntions that the company’s outside auditor, Arthur Andersen\nLLP, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminat-\ning documents.       The Government acknowledges that\n§1519 was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate\ndocument-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrong-\ndoing. Brief for United States 46. Prior law made it an\noffense to “intimidat[e], threate[n], or corruptly persuad[e]\nanother person” to shred documents. §1512(b) (emphasis\nadded). Section 1519 cured a conspicuous omission by\nimposing liability on a person who destroys records him-\nself. See S. Rep. No. 107–146, p. 14 (2002) (describing\n§1519 as “a new general anti shredding provision” and\nexplaining that “certain current provisions make it a\ncrime to persuade another person to destroy documents,\nbut not a crime to actually destroy the same documents\nyourself ”). The new section also expanded prior law by\nincluding within the provision’s reach “any matter within\nthe jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United\nStates.” Id., at 14–15.\n   In the Government’s view, §1519 extends beyond the\nprincipal evil motivating its passage. The words of §1519,\nthe Government argues, support reading the provision as\na general ban on the spoliation of evidence, covering all\nphysical items that might be relevant to any matter under\nfederal investigation.\n   Yates urges a contextual reading of §1519, tying “tangi-\nble object” to the surrounding words, the placement of the\nprovision within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and related\n                   Cite as: 574 U.

Section 1519, he\nmaintains, targets not all manner of evidence, but records,\ndocuments, and tangible objects used to preserve them,\ne.g., computers, servers, and other media on which infor-\nmation is stored.\n   We agree with Yates and reject the Government’s unre-\nstrained reading. “Tangible object” in §1519, we conclude,\nis better read to cover only objects one can use to record or\npreserve information, not all objects in the physical world.\n                              A\n   The ordinary meaning of an “object” that is “tangible,”\nas stated in dictionary definitions, is “a discrete . . . thing,”\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary 1555\n(2002), that “possess[es] physical form,” Black’s Law Dic-\ntionary 1683 (10th ed. 2014). From this premise, the\nGovernment concludes that “tangible object,” as that term\nappears in §1519, covers the waterfront, including fish\nfrom the sea.\n   Whether a statutory term is unambiguous, however,\ndoes not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its compo-\nnent words. Rather, “[t]he plainness or ambiguity of\nstatutory language is determined [not only] by reference to\nthe language itself, [but as well by] the specific context in\nwhich that language is used, and the broader context of\nthe statute as a whole.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU. S. 337, 341 (1997). See also Deal v. United States, 508\nU. S. 129, 132 (1993) (it is a “fundamental principle of\nstatutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself)\nthat the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isola-\ntion, but must be drawn from the context in which it is\nused”). Ordinarily, a word’s usage accords with its dic-\ntionary definition. In law as in life, however, the same\nwords, placed in different contexts, sometimes mean dif-\nferent things.\n8                YATES v.

That Rule requires the\nprosecution to grant a defendant’s request to inspect\n“tangible objects” within the Government’s control that\nhave utility for the defense. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n16(a)(1)(E).\n   Rule 16’s reference to “tangible objects” has been inter-\npreted to include any physical evidence. See 5 W. LaFave,\nJ. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §20.3(g),\npp. 405–406, and n. 120 (3d ed. 2007). Rule 16 is a discov-\nery rule designed to protect defendants by compelling the\nprosecution to turn over to the defense evidence material\nto the charges at issue. In that context, a comprehensive\nconstruction of “tangible objects” is fitting. In contrast,\n§1519 is a penal provision that refers to “tangible object”\nnot in relation to a request for information relevant to a\nspecific court proceeding, but rather in relation to federal\ninvestigations or proceedings of every kind, including\nthose not yet begun.3 See Commissioner v. National Car-\nbide Corp., 167 F. 2d 304, 306 (CA2 1948) (Hand, J.)\n——————\n  2 The  dissent assiduously ignores all this, post, at 11–12, in insisting\nthat Congress wrote §1519 to cover, along with shredded corporate\ndocuments, red grouper slightly smaller than the legal limit.\n  3 For the same reason, we do not think the meaning of “tangible ob-\n\njects” (or “tangible things,” see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)) in other\ndiscovery prescriptions cited by the Government leads to the conclusion\nthat “tangible object” in §1519 encompasses any and all physical\nevidence existing on land or in the sea.\n10               YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\n(“words are chameleons, which reflect the color of their\nenvironment”). Just as the context of Rule 16 supports\ngiving “tangible object” a meaning as broad as its diction-\nary definition, the context of §1519 tugs strongly in favor\nof a narrower reading.\n                              B\n   Familiar interpretive guides aid our construction of the\nwords “tangible object” as they appear in §1519.\n   We note first §1519’s caption: “Destruction, alteration,\nor falsification of records in Federal investigations and\nbankruptcy.” That heading conveys no suggestion that the\nsection prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evi-\ndence, however remote from records. Neither does the\ntitle of the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in which\n§1519 was placed, §802: “Criminal penalties for altering\ndocuments.” 116 Stat. 800. Furthermore, §1520, the only\nother provision passed as part of §802, is titled “Destruc-\ntion of corporate audit records” and addresses only that\nspecific subset of records and documents. While these\nheadings are not commanding, they supply cues that\nCongress did not intend “tangible object” in §1519 to\nsweep within its reach physical objects of every kind,\nincluding things no one would describe as records, docu-\nments, or devices closely associated with them. See\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 234\n(1998) (“[T]he title of a statute and the heading of a sec-\ntion are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about\nthe meaning of a statute.” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). If Congress indeed meant to make §1519 an all-\nencompassing ban on the spoliation of evidence, as the\ndissent believes Congress did, one would have expected a\nclearer indication of that intent.\n   Section 1519’s position within Chapter 73 of Title 18\nfurther signals that §1519 was not intended to serve as a\ncross-the-board ban on the destruction of physical evi-\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Congress placed §1519 (and its com-\npanion provision §1520) at the end of the chapter, follow-\ning immediately after the pre-existing §1516, §1517, and\n§1518, each of them prohibiting obstructive acts in specific\ncontexts. See §1516 (audits of recipients of federal funds);\n§1517 (federal examinations of financial institutions);\n§1518 (criminal investigations of federal health care of-\nfenses). See also S. Rep. No. 107–146, at 7 (observing that\n§1517 and §1518 “apply to obstruction in certain limited\ntypes of cases, such as bankruptcy fraud, examinations of\nfinancial institutions, and healthcare fraud”).\n   But Congress did not direct codification of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act’s other additions to Chapter 73 adjacent to these\nspecialized provisions. Instead, Congress directed place-\nment of those additions within or alongside retained pro-\nvisions that address obstructive acts relating broadly to\nofficial proceedings and criminal trials: Section 806, “Civil\nAction to protect against retaliation in fraud cases,” was\ncodified as §1514A and inserted between the pre-existing\n§1514, which addresses civil actions to restrain harass-\nment of victims and witnesses in criminal cases, and\n§1515, which defines terms used in §1512 and §1513.\nSection 1102, “Tampering with a record or otherwise\nimpeding an official proceeding,” was codified as §1512(c)\nand inserted within the pre-existing §1512, which ad-\ndresses tampering with a victim, witness, or informant to\nimpede any official proceeding. Section 1107, “Retaliation\nagainst informants,” was codified as §1513(e) and inserted\nwithin the pre-existing §1513, which addresses retaliation\nagainst a victim, witness, or informant in any official\nproceeding. Congress thus ranked §1519, not among the\nbroad proscriptions, but together with specialized provi-\nsions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial\naudits. This placement accords with the view that Con-\ngress’ conception of §1519’s coverage was considerably\n12                   YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nmore limited than the Government’s.4\n  The contemporaneous passage of §1512(c)(1), which was\ncontained in a section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act discrete\nfrom the section embracing §1519 and §1520, is also in-\nstructive. Section 1512(c)(1) provides:\n       “(c) Whoever corruptly—\n       “(1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record,\n    document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with\n    the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availabil-\n    ity for use in an official proceeding\n         .            .           .           .          .\n    “shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n    than 20 years, or both.”\n\nThe legislative history reveals that §1512(c)(1) was drafted\nand proposed after §1519. See 148 Cong. Rec. 12518,\n13088–13089 (2002). The Government argues, and Yates\ndoes not dispute, that §1512(c)(1)’s reference to “other\nobject” includes any and every physical object. But if\n§1519’s reference to “tangible object” already included all\nphysical objects, as the Government and the dissent con-\ntend, then Congress had no reason to enact §1512(c)(1):\nVirtually any act that would violate §1512(c)(1) no doubt\nwould violate §1519 as well, for §1519 applies to “the\n——————\n  4 The dissent contends that nothing can be drawn from the placement\n\nof §1519 because, before and after Sarbanes-Oxley, “all of Chapter 73\nwas ordered chronologically.” Post, at 9. The argument might have\nsome force if the factual premise were correct. In Sarbanes-Oxley,\nCongress directed insertion of §1514A before §1518, then the last\nsection in Chapter 73. If, as the dissent argues, Congress adopted\n§1519 to fill out §1512, post, at 6–7, it would have made more sense for\nCongress to codify the substance of §1519 within §1512 or in a new\n§1512A, rather than placing §1519 among specialized provisions.\nNotably, in Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress added §1512(c)(1), “a broad ban\non evidence-spoliation,” cf. post, at 9, n. 2, to §1512, even though\n§1512’s preexisting title and provisions all related to witness-\ntampering.\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

Nowhere does the Government explain\nwhat independent function §1512(c)(1) would serve if the\nGovernment is right about the sweeping scope of §1519.\nWe resist a reading of §1519 that would render superflu-\nous an entire provision passed in proximity as part of the\nsame Act.6 See Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 14) (“[T]he canon against sur-\nplusage is strongest when an interpretation would render\nsuperfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.”).\n  The words immediately surrounding “tangible object” in\n§1519—“falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record [or]\n——————\n   5 Despite this sweeping “in relation to” language, the dissent remark-\n\nably suggests that §1519 does not “ordinarily operate in th[e] context\n[of] federal court[s],” for those courts are not “department[s] or\nagenc[ies].” Post, at 10. That suggestion, which, as one would expect,\nlacks the Government’s endorsement, does not withstand examination.\nThe Senate Committee Report on §1519, on which the dissent else-\nwhere relies, see post, at 6, explained that an obstructive act is within\n§1519’s scope if “done ‘in contemplation’ of or in relation to a matter or\ninvestigation.” S. Rep. 107–146, at 15. The Report further informed\nthat §1519 “is . . . meant to do away with the distinctions, which some\ncourts have read into obstruction statutes, between court proceedings,\ninvestigations, regulatory or administrative proceedings (whether\nformal or not), and less formal government inquiries, regardless of their\ntitle.” Ibid. If any doubt remained about the multiplicity of contexts in\nwhich §1519 was designed to apply, the Report added, “[t]he intent of\nthe provision is simple; people should not be destroying, altering, or\nfalsifying documents to obstruct any government function.” Ibid.\n   6 Furthermore, if “tangible object” in §1519 is read to include any\n\nphysical object, §1519 would prohibit all of the conduct proscribed by\n§2232(a), which imposes a maximum penalty of five years in prison for\ndestroying or removing “property” to prevent its seizure by the Gov-\nernment. See supra, at 1–2.\n14                YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\ndocument”—also cabin the contextual meaning of that\nterm. As explained in Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S.\n561, 575 (1995), we rely on the principle of noscitur a\nsociis—a word is known by the company it keeps—to\n“avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is\ninconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving\nunintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted). See also United States v. Wil-\nliams, 553 U. S. 285, 294 (2008) (“a word is given more\nprecise content by the neighboring words with which it is\nassociated”). In Gustafson, we interpreted the word\n“communication” in §2(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 to\nrefer to a public communication, rather than any commu-\nnication, because the word appeared in a list with other\nwords, notably “notice, circular, [and] advertisement,”\nmaking it “apparent that the list refer[red] to documents\nof wide dissemination.” 513 U. S., at 575–576. And we did\nso even though the list began with the word “any.”\n   The noscitur a sociis canon operates in a similar manner\nhere. “Tangible object” is the last in a list of terms that\nbegins “any record [or] document.” The term is therefore\nappropriately read to refer, not to any tangible object, but\nspecifically to the subset of tangible objects involving\nrecords and documents, i.e., objects used to record or\npreserve information.      See United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual §2J1.2, comment., n. 1\n(Nov. 2014) (“ ‘Records, documents, or tangible objects’\nincludes (A) records, documents, or tangible objects that\nare stored on, or that are, magnetic, optical, digital, other\nelectronic, or other storage mediums or devices; and (B)\nwire or electronic communications.”).\n   This moderate interpretation of “tangible object” accords\nwith the list of actions §1519 proscribes. The section\napplies to anyone who “alters, destroys, mutilates, con-\nceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any\nrecord, document, or tangible object” with the requisite\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

The last two verbs,\n“falsif[y]” and “mak[e] a false entry in,” typically take as\ngrammatical objects records, documents, or things used to\nrecord or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard\ndrives. See, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 720 (10th ed.\n2014) (defining “falsify” as “[t]o make deceptive; to coun-\nterfeit, forge, or misrepresent; esp., to tamper with (a\ndocument, record, etc.)”). It would be unnatural, for ex-\nample, to describe a killer’s act of wiping his fingerprints\nfrom a gun as “falsifying” the murder weapon. But it\nwould not be strange to refer to “falsifying” data stored on\na hard drive as simply “falsifying” a hard drive. Further-\nmore, Congress did not include on §1512(c)(1)’s list of\nprohibited actions “falsifies” or “makes a false entry in.”\nSee §1512(c)(1) (making it unlawful to “alte[r], destro[y],\nmutilat[e], or concea[l] a record, document, or other object”\nwith the requisite obstructive intent). That contempora-\nneous omission also suggests that Congress intended\n“tangible object” in §1519 to have a narrower scope than\n“other object” in §1512(c)(1).7\n  A canon related to noscitur a sociis, ejusdem generis,\ncounsels: “Where general words follow specific words in a\n\n——————\n  7 The dissent contends that “record, document, or tangible object” in\n§1519 should be construed in conformity with “record, document, or\nother object” in §1512(c)(1) because both provisions address “the same\nbasic problem.” Post, at 11–12. But why should that be so when\nCongress prohibited in §1519 additional actions, specific to paper and\nelectronic documents and records, actions it did not prohibit in\n§1512(c)(1)? When Congress passed Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002, courts\nhad already interpreted the phrase “alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal\nan object” in §1512(b)(2)(B) to apply to all types of physical evidence.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Applewhaite, 195 F. 3d 679, 688 (CA3 1999)\n(affirming conviction under §1512(b)(2)(B) for persuading another\nperson to paint over blood spatter). Congress’ use of a formulation in\n§1519 that did not track the one used in §1512(b)(2)(B) (and repeated in\n§1512(c)(1)) suggests that Congress designed §1519 to be interpreted\napart from §1512, not in lockstep with it.\n16                YATES v.

S. 137, 142–143 (2008), for example, we\nrelied on this principle to determine what crimes were\ncovered by the statutory phrase “any crime . . . that . . . is\nburglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or\notherwise involves conduct that presents a serious poten-\ntial risk of physical injury to another,” 18 U. S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The enumeration of specific crimes, we\nexplained, indicates that the “otherwise involves” provi-\nsion covers “only similar crimes, rather than every crime\nthat ‘presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.’ ” 553 U. S., at 142. Had Congress intended the\nlatter “all encompassing” meaning, we observed, “it is hard\nto see why it would have needed to include the examples\nat all.” Ibid. See also CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept.\nof Revenue, 562 U. S. 277, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16) (“We\ntypically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general\nword will not render specific words meaningless.”). Just\nso here. Had Congress intended “tangible object” in §1519\nto be interpreted so generically as to capture physical\nobjects as dissimilar as documents and fish, Congress\nwould have had no reason to refer specifically to “record”\nor “document.” The Government’s unbounded reading of\n“tangible object” would render those words misleading\nsurplusage.\n   Having used traditional tools of statutory interpretation\nto examine markers of congressional intent within the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act and §1519 itself, we are persuaded\nthat an aggressive interpretation of “tangible object” must\nbe rejected. It is highly improbable that Congress would\nhave buried a general spoliation statute covering objects of\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

The MPC provision and pro-\nposals prompted by it would have imposed liability on\nanyone who “alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, or re-\nmoves a record, document or thing.” See ALI, MPC\n§241.7(1), p. 175 (1962). Those proscriptions were under-\nstood to refer to all physical evidence. See MPC §241.7,\nComment 3, at 179 (1980) (provision “applies to any physi-\ncal object”). Accordingly, the Government reasons, and\nthe dissent exuberantly agrees, post, at 4–5, Congress\nmust have intended §1519 to apply to the universe of\nphysical evidence.\n   The inference is unwarranted. True, the 1962 MPC\nprovision prohibited tampering with any kind of physical\nevidence. But unlike §1519, the MPC provision did not\nprohibit actions that specifically relate to records, docu-\nments, and objects used to record or preserve information.\nThe MPC provision also ranked the offense as a misde-\nmeanor and limited liability to instances in which the\nactor “believ[es] that an official proceeding or investigation\nis pending or about to be instituted.” MPC §241.7(1), at\n175. Yates would have had scant reason to anticipate a\nfelony prosecution, and certainly not one instituted at a\ntime when even the smallest of the fish he caught came\nwithin the legal limit. See supra, at 4; cf. Bond v. United\nStates, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014), (slip op., at 14) (rejecting\n“boundless reading” of a statutory term given “deeply\nserious consequences” that reading would entail). A pro-\nposed federal offense in line with the MPC provision,\nadvanced by a federal commission in 1971, was similarly\n18                YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nqualified. See Final Report of the National Commission\non Reform of Federal Criminal Laws §1323, pp. 116–117\n(1971).\n   Section 1519 conspicuously lacks the limits built into\nthe MPC provision and the federal proposal. It describes\nnot a misdemeanor, but a felony punishable by up to 20\nyears in prison. And the section covers conduct intended\nto impede any federal investigation or proceeding, includ-\ning one not even on the verge of commencement. Given\nthese significant differences, the meaning of “record,\ndocument, or thing” in the MPC provision and a kindred\nproposal is not a reliable indicator of the meaning Con-\ngress assigned to “record, document, or tangible object” in\n§1519. The MPC provision, in short, tells us neither “what\nCongress wrote [nor] what Congress wanted,” cf. post, at\n15, concerning Yates’s small fish as the subject of a federal\nfelony prosecution.\n                             C\n  Finally, if our recourse to traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction leaves any doubt about the meaning of “tan-\ngible object,” as that term is used in §1519, we would\ninvoke the rule that “ambiguity concerning the ambit of\ncriminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.”\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000) (quot-\ning Rewis v. United States, 401 U. S. 808, 812 (1971)).\nThat interpretative principle is relevant here, where the\nGovernment urges a reading of §1519 that exposes indi-\nviduals to 20-year prison sentences for tampering with any\nphysical object that might have evidentiary value in any\nfederal investigation into any offense, no matter whether\nthe investigation is pending or merely contemplated, or\nwhether the offense subject to investigation is criminal or\ncivil.

The defendant in McRae, a police officer who seized a car\ncontaining a corpse and then set it on fire, was also convicted for that\nconduct under 18 U. S. C. §844(h) and sentenced to a term of 120\nmonths’ imprisonment for that offense. See 702 F. 3d, at 817–818, 839–\n840. The defendant in Natal, who repainted a van to cover up evidence\nof a fatal arson, was also convicted of three counts of violating 18\nU. S. C. §3 and sentenced to concurrent terms of 174 months’ impris-\nonment. See Judgment in United States v. Morales, No. 3:12–cr–164\n(Conn., Jan. 12, 2015). And the defendant in Maury, a company con-\nvicted under §1519 of concealing evidence that a cement mixer’s safety\nlock was disabled when a worker’s fingers were amputated, was also\nconvicted of numerous other violations, including three counts of\nviolating 18 U.

YATES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [February 25, 2015]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.\n   This case can and should be resolved on narrow\ngrounds. And though the question is close, traditional\ntools of statutory construction confirm that John Yates has\nthe better of the argument. Three features of 18 U. S. C.\n§1519 stand out to me: the statute’s list of nouns, its list of\nverbs, and its title. Although perhaps none of these fea-\ntures by itself would tip the case in favor of Yates, the\nthree combined do so.\n   Start with the nouns. Section 1519 refers to “any rec-\nord, document, or tangible object.” The noscitur a sociis\ncanon instructs that when a statute contains a list, each\nword in that list presumptively has a “similar” meaning.\nSee, e.g., Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 576\n(1995). A related canon, ejusdem generis teaches that\ngeneral words following a list of specific words should\nusually be read in light of those specific words to mean\nsomething “similar.” See, e.g., Christopher v. SmithKline\nBeecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 18).\nApplying these canons to §1519’s list of nouns, the term\n“tangible object” should refer to something similar to\nrecords or documents. A fish does not spring to mind—nor\ndoes an antelope, a colonial farmhouse, a hydrofoil, or an\noil derrick. All are “objects” that are “tangible.” But who\nwouldn’t raise an eyebrow if a neighbor, when asked to\nidentify something similar to a “record” or “document,”\n2                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsaid “crocodile”?\n   This reading, of course, has its shortcomings. For in-\nstance, this is an imperfect ejusdem generis case because\n“record” and “document” are themselves quite general.\nAnd there is a risk that “tangible object” may be made\nsuperfluous—what is similar to a “record” or “document”\nbut yet is not one? An e-mail, however, could be such a\nthing. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guide-\nlines Manual §2J1.2 and comment. (Nov. 2003) (reading\n“records, documents, or tangible objects” to “includ[e]” what\nis found on “magnetic, optical, digital, other electronic,\nor other storage mediums or devices”). An e-mail, after\nall, might not be a “document” if, as was “traditionally” so,\na document was a “piece of paper with information on it,”\nnot “information stored on a computer, electronic storage\ndevice, or any other medium.” Black’s Law Dictionary\n587–588 (10th ed. 2014). E-mails might also not be “rec-\nords” if records are limited to “minutes” or other formal\nwritings “designed to memorialize [past] events.” Id., at\n1465. A hard drive, however, is tangible and can contain\nfiles that are precisely akin to even these narrow defini-\ntions. Both “record” and “document” can be read more\nexpansively, but adding “tangible object” to §1519 would\nensure beyond question that electronic files are included.\nTo be sure, “tangible object” presumably can capture more\nthan just e-mails; Congress enacts “catchall[s]” for “known\nunknowns.” Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. 848, 860\n(2009). But where noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\napply, “known unknowns” should be similar to known\nknowns, i.e., here, records and documents. This is espe-\ncially true because reading “tangible object” too broadly\ncould render “record” and “document” superfluous.\n   Next, consider §1519’s list of verbs: “alters, destroys,\nmutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false\nentry in.” Although many of those verbs could apply to\nnouns as far-flung as salamanders, satellites, or sand\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndunes, the last phrase in the list—“makes a false entry\nin”—makes no sense outside of filekeeping. How does one\nmake a false entry in a fish? “Alters” and especially “falsi-\nfies” are also closely associated with filekeeping. Not one\nof the verbs, moreover, cannot be applied to filekeeping—\ncertainly not in the way that “makes a false entry in” is\nalways inconsistent with the aquatic.\n   Again, the Government is not without a response. One\ncan imagine Congress trying to write a law so broadly that\nnot every verb lines up with every noun. But failure to\n“line up” may suggest that something has gone awry in\none’s interpretation of a text. Where, as here, each of a\nstatute’s verbs applies to a certain category of nouns, there\nis some reason to think that Congress had that category in\nmind. Categories, of course, are often underinclusive or\noverinclusive—§1519, for instance, applies to a bomb-\nthreatening letter but not a bomb. But this does not mean\nthat categories are not useful or that Congress does not\nenact them. See, e.g., Vance v. Bradley, 440 U. S. 93, 108–\n109 (1979). Here, focusing on the verbs, the category of\nnouns appears to be filekeeping. This observation is not\ndispositive, but neither is it nothing. The Government\nalso contends that §1519’s verbs cut both ways because it\nis unnatural to apply “falsifies” to tangible objects, and\nthat is certainly true. One does not falsify the outside\ncasing of a hard drive, but one could falsify or alter data\nphysically recorded on that hard drive.\n   Finally, my analysis is influenced by §1519’s title: “De-\nstruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal\ninvestigations and bankruptcy.” (Emphasis added.) This\ntoo points toward filekeeping, not fish. Titles can be use-\nful devices to resolve “ ‘doubt about the meaning of a stat-\nute.’ ” Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 527–528 (2002)\n(quoting Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S.\n224, 234 (1998)); see also Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U. S.\n___, ___–___ (2014) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\n4                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nat 4–6). The title is especially valuable here because it\nreinforces what the text’s nouns and verbs independently\nsuggest—that no matter how other statutes might be read,\nthis particular one does not cover every noun in the uni-\nverse with tangible form.\n   Titles, of course, are also not dispositive. Here, if the\nlist of nouns did not already suggest that “tangible object”\nshould mean something similar to records or documents,\nespecially when read in conjunction with §1519’s peculiar\nlist of verbs with their focus on filekeeping, then the title\nwould not be enough on its own. In conjunction with those\nother two textual features, however, the Government’s\nargument, though colorable, becomes too implausible to\naccept. See, e.g., Washington State Dept. of Social and\nHealth Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U. S.\n371, 384–385 (2003) (focusing on the “product of [two]\ncanons of construction” which was “confirmed” by other\ninterpretative evidence); cf. Al-Adahi v.

YATES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                     [February 25, 2015]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE\nKENNEDY, and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.\n   A criminal law, 18 U. S. C. §1519, prohibits tampering\nwith “any record, document, or tangible object” in an\nattempt to obstruct a federal investigation. This case\nraises the question whether the term “tangible object”\nmeans the same thing in §1519 as it means in everyday\nlanguage—any object capable of being touched. The an-\nswer should be easy: Yes. The term “tangible object” is\nbroad, but clear. Throughout the U. S. Code and many\nStates’ laws, it invariably covers physical objects of all\nkinds. And in §1519, context confirms what bare text\nsays: All the words surrounding “tangible object” show\nthat Congress meant the term to have a wide range. That\nfits with Congress’s evident purpose in enacting §1519: to\npunish those who alter or destroy physical evidence—any\nphysical evidence—with the intent of thwarting federal\nlaw enforcement.\n   The plurality instead interprets “tangible object” to\ncover “only objects one can use to record or preserve in-\nformation.” Ante, at 7. The concurring opinion similarly,\nif more vaguely, contends that “tangible object” should\nrefer to “something similar to records or documents”—and\nshouldn’t include colonial farmhouses, crocodiles, or fish.\nAnte, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). In my view,\nconventional tools of statutory construction all lead to a\n2                      YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmore conventional result: A “tangible object” is an object\nthat’s tangible. I would apply the statute that Congress\nenacted and affirm the judgment below.\n                               I\n   While the plurality starts its analysis with §1519’s\nheading, see ante, at 10 (“We note first §1519’s caption”), I\nwould begin with §1519’s text. When Congress has not\nsupplied a definition, we generally give a statutory term\nits ordinary meaning. See, e.g., Schindler Elevator Corp.\nv. United States ex rel. Kirk, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 5). As the plurality must acknowledge, the ordi-\nnary meaning of “tangible object” is “a discrete thing that\npossesses physical form.” Ante, at 7 (punctuation and\ncitation omitted). A fish is, of course, a discrete thing that\npossesses physical form. See generally Dr. Seuss, One\nFish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (1960). So the ordinary\nmeaning of the term “tangible object” in §1519, as no\none here disputes, covers fish (including too-small red\ngrouper).\n   That interpretation accords with endless uses of the\nterm in statute and rule books as construed by courts.\nDozens of federal laws and rules of procedure (and hun-\ndreds of state enactments) include the term “tangible\nobject” or its first cousin “tangible thing”—some in associ-\nation with documents, others not. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C.\n§8302(2) (referring to “any material or tangible object that\ncould harbor a pest or disease”); 15 U. S. C. §57b–1(c)\n(authorizing investigative demands for “documentary\nmaterial or tangible things”); 18 U. S. C. §668(a)(1)(D)\n(defining “museum” as entity that owns “tangible objects\nthat are exhibited to the public”); 28 U. S. C. §2507(b)\n(allowing discovery of “relevant facts, books, papers, doc-\numents or tangible things”).1 To my knowledge, no court\n——————\n    1 From   Alabama and Alaska through Wisconsin and Wyoming (and\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

For example, courts have understood the\nphrases “tangible objects” and “tangible things” in the\nFederal Rules of Criminal and Civil Procedure to cover\neverything from guns to drugs to machinery to . . . ani-\nmals. See, e.g., United States v. Obiukwu, 17 F. 3d 816,\n819 (CA6 1994) (per curiam) (handgun); United States v.\nAcarino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1609215\"><a href=\"/opinion/1609215/united-states-v-acarino/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Reynolds Metals\nCorp., 297 F. 2d 49, 56–57 (CA9 1961) (cattle). No sur-\nprise, then, that—until today—courts have uniformly\napplied the term “tangible object” in §1519 in the same\nway. See, e.g., United States v. McRae, 702 F. 3d 806,\n834–838 (CA5 2012) (corpse); United States v. Maury, 695\nF. 3d 227, 243–244 (CA3 2012) (cement mixer).\n  That is not necessarily the end of the matter; I agree\nwith the plurality (really, who does not?) that context\nmatters in interpreting statutes. We do not “construe the\nmeaning of statutory terms in a vacuum.” Tyler v. Cain,\n533 U. S. 656, 662 (2001). Rather, we interpret particular\nwords “in their context and with a view to their place in\nthe overall statutory scheme.” Davis v. Michigan Dept. of\nTreasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989). And sometimes that\n——————\ntrust me—in all that come between), States similarly use the terms\n“tangible objects” and “tangible things” in statutes and rules of all\nsorts. See, e.g., Ala. Code §34–17–1(3) (2010) (defining “landscape\narchitecture” to include the design of certain “tangible objects and\nfeatures”); Alaska Rule Civ. Proc. 34(a)(1) (2014) (allowing litigants to\n“inspect, copy, test, or sample any tangible things” that constitute or\ncontain discoverable material); Wis. Stat. §804.09(1) (2014) (requiring\nthe production of “designated tangible things” in civil proceedings);\nWyo. Rule Crim. Proc. 41(h) (2014) (defining “property” for purposes of\na search-and-seizure statute to include “documents, books, papers and\nany other tangible objects”).\n4                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmeans, as the plurality says, that the dictionary definition\nof a disputed term cannot control. See, e.g., Bloate v.\nUnited States, 559 U. S. 196, 205, n. 9 (2010). But this is\nnot such an occasion, for here the text and its context\npoint the same way. Stepping back from the words “tan-\ngible object” provides only further evidence that Congress\nsaid what it meant and meant what it said.\n  Begin with the way the surrounding words in §1519\nreinforce the breadth of the term at issue. Section 1519\nrefers to “any” tangible object, thus indicating (in line with\nthat word’s plain meaning) a tangible object “of whatever\nkind.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 97\n(2002). This Court has time and again recognized that\n“any” has “an expansive meaning,” bringing within a\nstatute’s reach all types of the item (here, “tangible ob-\nject”) to which the law refers. Department of Housing and\nUrban Development v. Rucker, 535 U. S. 125, 131 (2002);\nsee, e.g., Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. 848, 856\n(2009); Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214,\n219–220 (2008). And the adjacent laundry list of verbs in\n§1519 (“alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up,\nfalsifies, or makes a false entry”) further shows that Con-\ngress wrote a statute with a wide scope. Those words are\nsupposed to ensure—just as “tangible object” is meant to—\nthat §1519 covers the whole world of evidence-tampering,\nin all its prodigious variety. See United States v. Rodgers,\n466 U. S. 475, 480 (1984) (rejecting a “narrow, technical\ndefinition” of a statutory term when it “clashes strongly”\nwith “sweeping” language in the same sentence).\n  Still more, “tangible object” appears as part of a three-\nnoun phrase (including also “records” and “documents”)\ncommon to evidence-tampering laws and always under-\nstood to embrace things of all kinds. The Model Penal\nCode’s evidence-tampering section, drafted more than 50\nyears ago, similarly prohibits a person from “alter[ing],\ndestroy[ing], conceal[ing] or remov[ing] any record, docu-\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            5\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nment or thing” in an effort to thwart an official investiga-\ntion or proceeding. ALI, Model Penal Code §241.7(1),\np. 175 (1962) (emphasis added). The Code’s commentary\nemphasizes that the offense described in that provision is\n“not limited to conduct that [alters] a written instrument.”\nId., §241.7, Comment 3, at 179. Rather, the language\nextends to “any physical object.” Ibid. Consistent with\nthat statement—and, of course, with ordinary meaning—\ncourts in the more than 15 States that have laws based on\nthe Model Code’s tampering provision apply them to all\ntangible objects, including drugs, guns, vehicles and . . .\nyes, animals. See, e.g., State v. Majors, 318 S. W. 3d 850,\n859–861 (Tenn. 2010) (cocaine); Puckett v.

Dist. LEXIS 615, *5–*7 (Dec. 21, 2007)\n(deer antlers). Not a one has limited the phrase’s scope to\nobjects that record or preserve information.\n   The words “record, document, or tangible object” in\n§1519 also track language in 18 U. S. C. §1512, the federal\nwitness-tampering law covering (as even the plurality\naccepts, see ante, at 12) physical evidence in all its forms.\nSection 1512, both in its original version (preceding §1519)\nand today, repeatedly uses the phrase “record, document,\nor other object”—most notably, in a provision prohibiting\nthe use of force or threat to induce another person to\nwithhold any of those materials from an official proceed-\ning. §4(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of\n1982, 96 Stat. 1249, as amended, 18 U. S. C. §1512(b)(2).\nThat language, which itself likely derived from the Model\nPenal Code, encompasses no less the bloody knife than the\nincriminating letter, as all courts have for decades agreed.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Kellington, 217 F. 3d 1084, 1088\n(CA9 2000) (boat); United States v. Applewhaite, 195 F. 3d\n679, 688 (CA3 1999) (stone wall). And typically “only the\n6                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmost compelling evidence” will persuade this Court that\nCongress intended “nearly identical language” in provi-\nsions dealing with related subjects to bear different mean-\nings. Communication Workers v. Beck, 487 U. S. 735, 754\n(1988); see A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts 252 (2012). Context thus\nagain confirms what text indicates.\n   And legislative history, for those who care about it, puts\nextra icing on a cake already frosted. Section 1519, as the\nplurality notes, see ante, at 2, 6, was enacted after the\nEnron Corporation’s collapse, as part of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002, 116 Stat. 745. But the provision began\nits life in a separate bill, and the drafters emphasized that\nEnron was “only a case study exposing the shortcomings\nin our current laws” relating to both “corporate and crimi-\nnal” fraud. S. Rep. No. 107–146, pp. 2, 11 (2002). The\nprimary “loophole[ ]” Congress identified, see id., at 14,\narose from limits in the part of §1512 just described: That\nprovision, as uniformly construed, prohibited a person\nfrom inducing another to destroy “record[s], document[s],\nor other object[s]”—of every type—but not from doing so\nhimself. §1512(b)(2); see supra, at 5. Congress (as even\nthe plurality agrees, see ante, at 6) enacted §1519 to close\nthat yawning gap. But §1519 could fully achieve that goal\nonly if it covered all the records, documents, and objects\n§1512 did, as well as all the means of tampering with\nthem. And so §1519 was written to do exactly that—“to\napply broadly to any acts to destroy or fabricate physical\nevidence,” as long as performed with the requisite intent.\nS. Rep. No. 107–146, at 14. “When a person destroys\nevidence,” the drafters explained, “overly technical legal\ndistinctions should neither hinder nor prevent prosecu-\ntion.” Id., at 7. Ah well: Congress, meet today’s Court,\nwhich here invents just such a distinction with just such\nan effect. See United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank,\n374 U.

S. ___ (2015)             7\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\na statute designed to close a loophole” is “illogical and\ndisrespectful of . . . congressional purpose”).\n  As Congress recognized in using a broad term, giving\nimmunity to those who destroy non-documentary evidence\nhas no sensible basis in penal policy. A person who hides\na murder victim’s body is no less culpable than one who\nburns the victim’s diary. A fisherman, like John Yates,\nwho dumps undersized fish to avoid a fine is no less\nblameworthy than one who shreds his vessel’s catch log\nfor the same reason. Congress thus treated both offenders\nin the same way. It understood, in enacting §1519, that\ndestroying evidence is destroying evidence, whether or not\nthat evidence takes documentary form.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   The plurality searches far and wide for anything—\nanything—to support its interpretation of §1519. But its\nfishing expedition comes up empty.\n   The plurality’s analysis starts with §1519’s title: “De-\nstruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal\ninvestigations and bankruptcy.” See ante, at 10; see also\nante, at 3–4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). That’s already a sign\nsomething is amiss. I know of no other case in which we\nhave begun our interpretation of a statute with the title,\nor relied on a title to override the law’s clear terms. In-\nstead, we have followed “the wise rule that the title of a\nstatute and the heading of a section cannot limit the plain\nmeaning of the text.” Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio\nR. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528–529 (1947).\n   The reason for that “wise rule” is easy to see: A title is,\nalmost necessarily, an abridgment. Attempting to men-\ntion every term in a statute “would often be ungainly as\nwell as useless”; accordingly, “matters in the text . . . are\nfrequently unreflected in the headings.” Id., at 528. Just\nlast year, this Court observed that two titles in a nearby\n8                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nsection of Sarbanes-Oxley serve as “but a short-hand\nreference to the general subject matter” of the provision at\nissue, “not meant to take the place of the detailed provi-\nsions of the text.” Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 16) (quoting Trainmen, 331 U. S., at\n528). The “under-inclusiveness” of the headings, we stated,\nwas “apparent.” Lawson, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n16). So too for §1519’s title, which refers to “destruction,\nalteration, or falsification” but not to mutilation, conceal-\nment, or covering up, and likewise mentions “records” but\nnot other documents or objects. Presumably, the plurality\nwould not refuse to apply §1519 when a person only con-\nceals evidence rather than destroying, altering, or falsify-\ning it; instead, the plurality would say that a title is just a\ntitle, which cannot “undo or limit” more specific statutory\ntext. Ibid. (quoting Trainmen, 331 U. S., at 529). The\nsame holds true when the evidence in question is not a\n“record” but something else whose destruction, alteration,\netc., is intended to obstruct justice.\n   The plurality next tries to divine meaning from §1519’s\n“position within Chapter 73 of Title 18.” Ante, at 10. But\nthat move is yet odder than the last. As far as I can tell,\nthis Court has never once suggested that the section num-\nber assigned to a law bears upon its meaning. Cf. Scalia,\nsupra, at xi–xvi (listing more than 50 interpretive princi-\nples and canons without mentioning the plurality’s new\nnumber-in-the-Code theory). And even on its own terms,\nthe plurality’s argument is hard to fathom. The plurality\nclaims that if §1519 applied to objects generally, Congress\nwould not have placed it “after the pre-existing §1516,\n§1517, and §1518” because those are “specialized provi-\nsions.” Ante, at 11. But search me if I can find a better\nplace for a broad ban on evidence-tampering. The plural-\nity seems to agree that the law properly goes in Chapter\n73—the criminal code’s chapter on “obstruction of justice.”\nBut the provision does not logically fit into any of that\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)                     9\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nchapter’s pre-existing sections. And with the first 18\nnumbers of the chapter already taken (starting with §1501\nand continuing through §1518), the law naturally took the\n19th place. That is standard operating procedure. Prior\nto the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, all of Chapter 73 was\nordered chronologically: Section 1518 was later enacted\nthan §1517, which was later enacted than §1516, which\nwas . . . well, you get the idea. And after Sarbanes-Oxley,\nCongress has continued in the same vein. Section 1519 is\nthus right where you would expect it (as is the contempo-\nraneously passed §1520)—between §1518 (added in 1996)\nand §1521 (added in 2008).2\n  The plurality’s third argument, relying on the surplus-\nage canon, at least invokes a known tool of statutory\nconstruction—but it too comes to nothing. Says the plu-\nrality: If read naturally, §1519 “would render superfluous”\n§1512(c)(1), which Congress passed “as part of the same\nact.” Ante, at 13. But that is not so: Although the two\nprovisions significantly overlap, each applies to conduct\nthe other does not. The key difference between the two is\nthat §1519 protects the integrity of “matter[s] within the\njurisdiction of any [federal] department or agency” whereas\n§1512(c)(1) safeguards “official proceeding[s]” as defined\nin §1515(a)(1)(A). Section 1519’s language often applies\nmore broadly than §1512(c)(1)’s, as the plurality notes.\n——————\n  2 The lonesome exception to Chapter 73’s chronological order is\n\n§1514A, added in Sarbanes-Oxley to create a civil action to protect\nwhistleblowers. Congress decided to place that provision right after the\nonly other section in Chapter 73 to authorize a civil action (that one to\nprotect victims and witnesses). The plurality, seizing on the §1514\nexample, says it likewise “would have made more sense for Congress to\ncodify the substance of §1519 within §1512 or in a new §1512A.” Ante,\nat 12, n. 4. But §1512 is titled “Tampering with a witness, victim, or an\ninformant,” and its provisions almost all protect witnesses from intimi-\ndation and harassment. It makes perfect sense that Congress wanted a\nbroad ban on evidence-spoliation to stand on its own rather than as\npart of—or an appendage to—a witness-tampering provision.\n10                    YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nFor example, an FBI investigation counts as a matter\nwithin a federal department’s jurisdiction, but falls out-\nside the statutory definition of “official proceeding” as\nconstrued by courts. See, e.g., United States v. Gabriel,\n125 F. 3d 89, 105, n. 13 (CA2 1997). But conversely,\n§1512(c)(1) sometimes reaches more widely than §1519.\nFor example, because an “official proceeding” includes any\n“proceeding before a judge or court of the United States,”\n§1512(c)(1) prohibits tampering with evidence in federal\nlitigation between private parties. See §1515(a)(1)(A);\nUnited States v. Burge, 711 F. 3d 803, 808–810 (CA7\n2013); United States v. Reich, 479 F. 3d 179, 185–187 (CA2\n2007) (Sotomayor, J.). By contrast, §1519 wouldn’t ordi-\nnarily operate in that context because a federal court isn’t\na “department or agency.” See Hubbard v. United States,\n514 U. S. 695, 715 (1995).3 So the surplusage canon\ndoesn’t come into play.4 Overlap—even significant over-\nlap—abounds in the criminal law. See Loughrin v. United\n\n——————\n  3 The plurality’s objection to this statement is difficult to understand.\n\nIt cannot take issue with Hubbard’s holding that “a federal court is\nneither a ‘department’ nor an ‘agency’ ” in a statute referring, just as\n§1519 does, to “any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or\nagency of the United States.” 514 U. S., at 698, 715. So the plurality\nsuggests that the phrase “in relation to . . . any such matter” in §1519\nsomehow changes Hubbard’s result. See ante, at 12–13, and n. 5. But\nthat phrase still demands that evidence-tampering relate to a “matter\nwithin the jurisdiction of any department or agency”—excluding courts,\nas Hubbard commands. That is why the federal government, as far as\nI can tell, has never once brought a prosecution under §1519 for\nevidence-tampering in litigation between private parties. It instead uses\n§1512(c)(1) for that purpose.\n  4 Section 1512(c)(1) also applies more broadly than §1519 in proceed-\n\nings relating to insurance regulation. The term “official proceeding” in\n§1512(c)(1) is defined to include “proceeding[s] involving the business of\ninsurance whose activities affect interstate commerce before any\ninsurance regulatory official or agency.” §1515(a)(1)(D). But §1519\nwouldn’t usually apply in that context because state, not federal,\nagencies handle most insurance regulation.\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)             11\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nStates, 573 U. S. ___, ___ – ___, n. 4 (2014) (slip op., at 6–7,\nn. 4). This Court has never thought that of such ordinary\nstuff surplusage is made. See ibid.; Connecticut Nat. Bank\nv. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992).\n   And the legislative history to which the plurality ap-\npeals, see ante, at 6, only cuts against it because those\nmaterials show that lawmakers knew that §1519 and\n§1512(c)(1) share much common ground. Minority Leader\nLott introduced the amendment that included §1512(c)(1)\n(along with other criminal and corporate fraud provisions)\nlate in the legislative process, explaining that he did so at\nthe specific request of the President. See 148 Cong. Rec.\n12509, 12512 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Lott). Not only Lott\nbut several other Senators noted the overlap between the\nPresident’s package and provisions already in the bill,\nmost notably §1519. See id., at 12512 (remarks of Sen.\nLott); id., at 12513 (remarks of Sen. Biden); id., at 12517\n(remarks of Sens. Hatch and Gramm). The presence of\nboth §1519 and §1512(c)(1) in the final Act may have\nreflected belt-and-suspenders caution: If §1519 contained\nsome flaw, §1512(c)(1) would serve as a backstop. Or the\naddition of §1512(c)(1) may have derived solely from legis-\nlators’ wish “to satisfy audiences other than courts”—that\nis, the President and his Justice Department. Gluck &\nBressman, Statutory Interpretation from the Inside, 65\nStan. L. Rev. 901, 935 (2013) (emphasis deleted). Which-\never the case, Congress’s consciousness of overlap between\nthe two provisions removes any conceivable reason to cast\naside §1519’s ordinary meaning in service of preventing\nsome statutory repetition.\n   Indeed, the inclusion of §1512(c)(1) in Sarbanes-Oxley\ncreates a far worse problem for the plurality’s construction\nof §1519 than for mine. Section 1512(c)(1) criminalizes the\ndestruction of any “record, document, or other object”;\n§1519 of any “record, document, or tangible object.” On\nthe plurality’s view, one “object” is really an object, where-\n12                    YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nas the other is only an object that preserves or stores\ninformation. But “[t]he normal rule of statutory construc-\ntion assumes that identical words used in different parts\nof the same act,” passed at the same time, “are intended to\nhave the same meaning.” Sorenson v. Secretary of Treas-\nury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And that is especially true when the different\nprovisions pertain to the same subject. See supra, at 5–6.\nThe plurality doesn’t—really, can’t—explain why it in-\nstead interprets the same words used in two provisions of\nthe same Act addressing the same basic problem to mean\nfundamentally different things.\n   Getting nowhere with surplusage, the plurality switches\ncanons, hoping that noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\nwill save it. See ante, at 13–16; see also ante, at 1–2 (opin-\nion of ALITO, J.). The first of those related canons advises\nthat words grouped in a list be given similar meanings.\nThe second counsels that a general term following specific\nwords embraces only things of a similar kind. According\nto the plurality, those Latin maxims change the English\nmeaning of “tangible object” to only things, like records\nand documents, “used to record or preserve information.”\nAnte, at 14.5 But understood as this Court always has, the\ncanons have no such transformative effect on the worka-\n——————\n  5 The plurality seeks support for this argument in the Sentencing\n\nCommission’s construction of the phrase “records, documents, or\ntangible objects,” ante, at 14, but to no avail. The plurality cites a note\nin the Commission’s Manual clarifying that this phrase, as used in the\nSentencing Guidelines, “includes” various electronic information,\ncommunications, and storage devices.           United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual §2J1.2, comment., n. 1 (Nov. 2014)\n(USSG). But “includes” (following its ordinary definition) “is not\nexhaustive,” as the Commission’s commentary makes explicit. USSG\n§1B1.1, comment., n. 2. Otherwise, the Commission’s construction\nwouldn’t encompass paper documents. All the note does is to make\nplain that “records, documents, or tangible objects” embraces stuff\nrelating to the digital (as well as the material) world.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            13\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nday language Congress chose.\n   As an initial matter, this Court uses noscitur a sociis\nand ejusdem generis to resolve ambiguity, not create it.\nThose principles are “useful rule[s] of construction where\nwords are of obscure or doubtful meaning.” Russell Motor\nCar Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514, 520 (1923). But\nwhen words have a clear definition, and all other contex-\ntual clues support that meaning, the canons cannot\nproperly defeat Congress’s decision to draft broad legisla-\ntion. See, e.g., Ali, 552 U. S., at 227 (rejecting the invoca-\ntion of these canons as an “attempt to create ambiguity\nwhere the statute’s text and structure suggest none”).\n   Anyway, assigning “tangible object” its ordinary mean-\ning comports with noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\nwhen applied, as they should be, with attention to §1519’s\nsubject and purpose. Those canons require identifying a\ncommon trait that links all the words in a statutory\nphrase. See, e.g., Graham County Soil and Water Conser-\nvation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. 280,\n289, n. 7 (2010); Ali, 552 U. S., at 224–226. In responding\nto that demand, the plurality characterizes records and\ndocuments as things that preserve information—and so\nthey are. But just as much, they are things that provide\ninformation, and thus potentially serve as evidence rele-\nvant to matters under review. And in a statute pertaining\nto obstruction of federal investigations, that evidentiary\nfunction comes to the fore. The destruction of records and\ndocuments prevents law enforcement agents from gather-\ning facts relevant to official inquiries. And so too does the\ndestruction of tangible objects—of whatever kind. Whether\nthe item is a fisherman’s ledger or an undersized fish,\nthrowing it overboard has the identical effect on the ad-\nministration of justice. See supra, at 7. For purposes of\n§1519, records, documents, and (all) tangible objects are\ntherefore alike.\n   Indeed, even the plurality can’t fully credit its nosci-\n14                YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ntur/ejusdem argument. The same reasoning would apply\nto every law placing the word “object” (or “thing”) after\n“record” and “document.” But as noted earlier, such stat-\nutes are common: The phrase appears (among other places)\nin many state laws based on the Model Penal Code, as\nwell as in multiple provisions of §1512. See supra, at 4–5.\nThe plurality accepts that in those laws “object” means\nobject; its argument about superfluity positively depends\non giving §1512(c)(1) that broader reading. See ante, at\n13, 16. What, then, is the difference here? The plurality\nproposes that some of those statutes describe less serious\noffenses than §1519. See ante, at 17. How and why that\ndistinction affects application of the noscitur a sociis and\nejusdem generis canons is left obscure: Count it as\none more of the plurality’s never-before-propounded,\nnot-readily-explained interpretive theories. See supra, at 7,\n8–9, 11–12. But in any event, that rationale cannot sup-\nport the plurality’s willingness to give “object” its natural\nmeaning in §1512, which (like §1519) sets out felonies\nwith penalties of up to 20 years. See §§1512(a)(3)(C), (b),\n(c). The canons, in the plurality’s interpretive world,\napparently switch on and off whenever convenient.\n   And the plurality’s invocation of §1519’s verbs does\nnothing to buttress its canon-based argument. See ante,\nat 14–15; ante, at 2–3 (opinion of ALITO, J.). The plurality\nobserves that §1519 prohibits “falsif[ying]” or “mak[ing] a\nfalse entry in” a tangible object, and no one can do those\nthings to, say, a murder weapon (or a fish). Ante, at 14.\nBut of course someone can alter, destroy, mutilate, con-\nceal, or cover up such a tangible object, and §1519 prohibits\nthose actions too. The Court has never before suggested\nthat all the verbs in a statute need to match up with all\nthe nouns. See Robers v. United States, 572 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 4) (“[T]he law does not require legisla-\ntors to write extra language specifically exempting, phrase\nby phrase, applications in respect to which a portion of a\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

It is exactly\nwhen Congress sets out to draft a statute broadly—to\ninclude every imaginable variation on a theme—that such\nmismatches will arise. To respond by narrowing the law,\nas the plurality does, is thus to flout both what Congress\nwrote and what Congress wanted.\n   Finally, when all else fails, the plurality invokes the\nrule of lenity. See ante, at 18. But even in its most robust\nform, that rule only kicks in when, “after all legitimate\ntools of interpretation have been exhausted, ‘a reasonable\ndoubt persists’ regarding whether Congress has made the\ndefendant’s conduct a federal crime.” Abramski v. United\nStates, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 12) (quoting Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990)). No such doubt lingers here. The plural-\nity points to the breadth of §1519, see ante, at 18, as\nthough breadth were equivalent to ambiguity. It is not.\nSection 1519 is very broad. It is also very clear. Every\ntraditional tool of statutory interpretation points in the\nsame direction, toward “object” meaning object. Lenity\noffers no proper refuge from that straightforward (even\nthough capacious) construction.6\n\n\n\n——————\n  6 As part of its lenity argument, the plurality asserts that Yates did\n\nnot have “fair warning” that his conduct amounted to a felony. Ante, at\n18; see ante, at 17 (stating that “Yates would have had scant reason to\nanticipate a felony prosecution” when throwing fish overboard). But\neven under the plurality’s view, the dumping of fish is potentially a\nfederal felony—just under §1512(c)(1), rather than §1519. See ante, at\n12–13. In any event, the plurality itself acknowledges that the ordi-\nnary meaning of §1519 covers Yates’s conduct, see ante, at 7: That\nprovision, no less than §1512(c)(1), announces its broad scope in the\nclearest possible terms. And when an ordinary citizen seeks notice of a\nstatute’s scope, he is more likely to focus on the plain text than (as the\nplurality would have it) on the section number, the superfluity princi-\nple, and the noscitur and ejusdem canons.\n16                YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n                              B\n   The concurring opinion is a shorter, vaguer version of\nthe plurality’s. It relies primarily on the noscitur a sociis\nand ejusdem generis canons, tries to bolster them with\n§1519’s “list of verbs,” and concludes with the section’s\ntitle. See supra, at 7–8, 12–13, 14–15 (addressing each of\nthose arguments). (Notably, even the concurrence puts no\nstock in the plurality’s section-number and superfluity\nclaims.) From those familiar materials, the concurrence\narrives at the following definition: “ ‘tangible object’ should\nmean something similar to records or documents.” Ante,\nat 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). In amplifying that purported\nguidance, the concurrence suggests applying the term\n“tangible object” in keeping with what “a neighbor, when\nasked to identify something similar to record or docu-\nment,” might answer. Ante, at 1. “[W]ho wouldn’t raise an\neyebrow,” the concurrence wonders, if the neighbor said\n“crocodile”? Ante, at 1–2. Courts sometimes say, when\nexplaining the Latin maxims, that the “words of a statute\nshould be interpreted consistent with their neighbors.”\nSee, e.g., United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 105 (2000).\nThe concurrence takes that expression literally.\n   But §1519’s meaning should not hinge on the odd game\nof Mad Libs the concurrence proposes. No one reading\n§1519 needs to fill in a blank after the words “records” and\n“documents.” That is because Congress, quite helpfully,\nalready did so—adding the term “tangible object.” The\nissue in this case is what that term means. So if the con-\ncurrence wishes to ask its neighbor a question, I’d recom-\nmend a more pertinent one: Do you think a fish (or, if the\nconcurrence prefers, a crocodile) is a “tangible object”? As\nto that query, “who wouldn’t raise an eyebrow” if the\nneighbor said “no”?\n   In insisting on its different question, the concurrence\nneglects the proper function of catchall phrases like “or\ntangible object.” The reason Congress uses such terms is\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)                 17\n\n                        KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nprecisely to reach things that, in the concurrence’s words,\n“do[ ] not spring to mind”—to my mind, to my neighbor’s,\nor (most important) to Congress’s. Ante, at 1 (opinion of\nALITO, J.). As this Court recently explained: “[T]he whole\nvalue of a generally phrased residual [term] is that it\nserves as a catchall for matters not specifically contem-\nplated—known unknowns.” Beaty, 556 U. S., at 860.\nCongress realizes that in a game of free association with\n“record” and “document,” it will never think of all the\nother things—including crocodiles and fish—whose de-\nstruction or alteration can (less frequently but just as\neffectively) thwart law enforcement. Cf. United States v.\nStubbs, 11 F. 3d 632, 637–638 (CA6 1993) (dead crocodiles\nused as evidence to support smuggling conviction). And so\nCongress adds the general term “or tangible object”—\nagain, exactly because such things “do[ ] not spring to\nmind.”7\n   The concurrence suggests that the term “tangible object”\nserves not as a catchall for physical evidence but to “en-\nsure beyond question” that e-mails and other electronic\nfiles fall within §1519’s compass. Ante, at 2. But that\nclaim is eyebrow-raising in its own right. Would a Con-\ngress wishing to make certain that §1519 applies to\ne-mails add the phrase “tangible object” (as opposed, say, to\n“electronic communications”)? Would a judge or jury\nmember predictably find that “tangible object” encom-\npasses something as virtual as e-mail (as compared, say,\n\n——————\n  7 The concurrence contends that when the noscitur and ejusdem can-\n\nons are in play, “ ‘known unknowns’ should be similar to known\nknowns, i.e., here, records and documents.” Ante, at 2. But as noted\nabove, records and documents are similar to crocodiles and fish as far\nas §1519 is concerned: All are potentially useful as evidence in an\ninvestigation. See supra, at 13. The concurrence never explains why\nthat similarity isn’t the relevant one in a statute aimed at evidence-\ntampering.\n18               YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nwith something as real as a fish)? If not (and the answer\nis not), then that term cannot function as a failsafe for\ne-mails.\n  The concurrence acknowledges that no one of its argu-\nments can carry the day; rather, it takes the Latin canons\nplus §1519’s verbs plus §1519’s title to “tip the case” for\nYates. Ante, at 1. But the sum total of three mistaken\narguments is . . . three mistaken arguments. They do not\nget better in the combining. And so the concurrence ends\nup right where the plurality does, except that the concur-\nrence, eschewing the rule of lenity, has nothing to fall\nback on.\n                              III\n   If none of the traditional tools of statutory interpreta-\ntion can produce today’s result, then what accounts for it?\nThe plurality offers a clue when it emphasizes the dispro-\nportionate penalties §1519 imposes if the law is read\nbroadly. See ante, at 17–18. Section 1519, the plurality\nobjects, would then “expose[ ] individuals to 20-year prison\nsentences for tampering with any physical object that\nmight have evidentiary value in any federal investigation\ninto any offense.” Ante, at 18. That brings to the surface\nthe real issue: overcriminalization and excessive punish-\nment in the U. S. Code.\n   Now as to this statute, I think the plurality somewhat—\nthough only somewhat—exaggerates the matter. The\nplurality omits from its description of §1519 the require-\nment that a person act “knowingly” and with “the intent to\nimpede, obstruct, or influence” federal law enforcement.\nAnd in highlighting §1519’s maximum penalty, the plural-\nity glosses over the absence of any prescribed minimum.\n(Let’s not forget that Yates’s sentence was not 20 years,\nbut 30 days.) Congress presumably enacts laws with high\nmaximums and no minimums when it thinks the prohibited\nconduct may run the gamut from major to minor. That\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)           19\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nis assuredly true of acts obstructing justice. Compare this\ncase with the following, all of which properly come within,\nbut now fall outside, §1519: McRae, 702 F. 3d, at 834–838\n(burning human body to thwart murder investigation);\nMaury, 695 F. 3d, at 243–244 (altering cement mixer to\nimpede inquiry into amputation of employee’s fingers);\nUnited States v. Natal, 2014 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 108852,\n*24–*26 (D Conn., Aug. 7, 2014) (repainting van to cover\nup evidence of fatal arson). Most district judges, as Con-\ngress knows, will recognize differences between such cases\nand prosecutions like this one, and will try to make the\npunishment fit the crime. Still and all, I tend to think, for\nthe reasons the plurality gives, that §1519 is a bad law—\ntoo broad and undifferentiated, with too-high maximum\npenalties, which give prosecutors too much leverage and\nsentencers too much discretion. And I’d go further: In\nthose ways, §1519 is unfortunately not an outlier, but an\nemblem of a deeper pathology in the federal criminal code.\n   But whatever the wisdom or folly of §1519, this Court\ndoes not get to rewrite the law. “Resolution of the pros\nand cons of whether a statute should sweep broadly or\nnarrowly is for Congress.” Rodgers, 466 U. S., at 484. If\njudges disagree with Congress’s choice, we are perfectly\nentitled to say so—in lectures, in law review articles, and\neven in dicta. But we are not entitled to replace the stat-\nute Congress enacted with an alternative of our own\ndesign.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 2781925, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/02/25/yates_v._united_states.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2014                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 13–7451. Argued November 5, 2014—Decided February 25, 2015\nWhile conducting an offshore inspection of a commercial fishing vessel\n in the Gulf of Mexico, a federal agent found that the ship’s catch con-\n tained undersized red grouper, in violation of federal conservation\n regulations. The officer instructed the ship’s captain, petitioner\n Yates, to keep the undersized fish segregated from the rest of the\n catch until the ship returned to port. After the officer departed,\n Yates instead told a crew member to throw the undersized fish over-\n board. For this offense, Yates was charged with destroying, conceal-\n ing, and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investiga-\n tion, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1519. That section provides that a\n person may be fined or imprisoned for up to 20 years if he “knowingly\n alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a\n false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent\n to impede, obstruct, or influence” a federal investigation. At trial,\n Yates moved for a judgment of acquittal on the §1519 charge. Point-\n ing to §1519’s origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,\n a law designed to protect investors and restore trust in financial\n markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Yates argued\n that §1519’s reference to “tangible object” subsumes objects used to\n store information, such as computer hard drives, not fish. The Dis-\n trict Court denied Yates’s motion, and a jury found him guilty of vio-\n lating §1519. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction, conclud-\n ing that §1519 applies to the destruction or concealment of fish\n because, as objects having physical form, fish fall within the diction-\n ary definition of “tangible object.”\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n733 F. 3d 1059, reversed and remanded.\n2                        YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n       JUSTICE GINSBURG, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE BREYER,\n    and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded that a “tangible object” within\n    §1519’s compass is one used to record or preserve information. Pp. 6–\n    20.\n       (a) Although dictionary definitions of the words “tangible” and “ob-\n    ject” bear consideration in determining the meaning of “tangible ob-\n    ject” in §1519, they are not dispositive. Whether a statutory term is\n    unambiguous “is determined [not only] by reference to the language\n    itself, [but also by] the specific context in which that language is\n    used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.” Robinson v.\n    Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341. Identical language may convey\n    varying content when used in different statutes, sometimes even in\n    different provisions of the same statute. See, e.g., FAA v. Cooper, 566\n    U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 7–10.\n       (b) Familiar interpretive guides aid the construction of “tangible\n    object.” Though not commanding, §1519’s heading—“Destruction, al-\n    teration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and\n    bankruptcy”—conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spolia-\n    tion of any and all physical evidence, however remote from records.\n       Section 1519’s position within Title 18, Chapter 73, further signals\n    that §1519 was not intended to serve as a cross-the-board ban on the\n    destruction of physical evidence. Congress placed §1519 at the end of\n    Chapter 73 following immediately after pre-existing specialized pro-\n    visions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial audits.\n       The contemporaneous passage of §1512(c)(1), which prohibits a\n    person from “alter[ing], destroy[ing], mutilat[ing], or conceal[ing] a\n    record, document, or other object . . . with the intent to impair the ob-\n    ject’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding,” is also\n    instructive. The Government argues that §1512(c)(1)’s reference to\n    “other object” includes any and every physical object. But if §1519’s\n    reference to “tangible object” already included all physical objects, as\n    the Government also contends, then Congress had no reason to enact\n    §1512(c)(1). Section 1519 should not be read to render superfluous an\n    entire provision passed in proximity as part of the same Act. See\n    Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. ___, ___.\n       The words immediately surrounding “tangible object” in §1519—\n    “falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record [or] document”—also\n    cabin the contextual meaning of that term. Applying the canons\n    noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis, “tangible object,” as the last in\n    a list of terms that begins “any record [or] document,” is appropriate-\n    ly read to refer, not to any tangible object, but specifically to the sub-\n    set of tangible objects used to record or preserve information. This\n    moderate interpretation accords with the list of actions §1519 pro-\n    scribes; the verbs “falsif[y]” and “mak[e] a false entry in” typically\n                      Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  take as grammatical objects records, documents, or things used to\n  record or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard drives. See\n  Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575.\n     Use of traditional tools of statutory interpretation to examine\n  markers of congressional intent within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and\n  §1519 itself thus call for rejection of an aggressive interpretation of\n  “tangible object.”\n     Furthermore, the meaning of “record, document, or thing” in a pro-\n  vision of the 1962 Model Penal Code (MPC) that has been interpreted\n  to prohibit tampering with any kind of physical evidence is not a reli-\n  able indicator of the meaning Congress assigned to “record, docu-\n  ment, or tangible object” in §1519. There are significant differences\n  between the offense described by the MPC provision and the offense\n  created by §1519. Pp. 10–18.\n     (c) Finally, if recourse to traditional tools of statutory construction\n  leaves any doubt about the meaning of “tangible object” in §1519, it\n  would be appropriate to invoke the rule of lenity. Pp. 18–19.\n     JUSTICE ALITO concluded that traditional rules of statutory con-\n  struction confirm that Yates has the better argument. Title 18\n  U. S. C. §1519’s list of nouns, list of verbs, and title, when combined,\n  tip the case in favor of Yates. Applying the canons noscitur a sociis\n  and ejusdem generis to the list of nouns—“any record, document, or\n  tangible object”—the term “tangible object” should refer to something\n  similar to records or documents. And while many of §1519’s verbs—\n  “alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a\n  false entry in”—could apply to far-flung nouns such as salamanders\n  or sand dunes, the term “makes a false entry in” makes no sense out-\n  side of filekeeping. Finally, §1519’s title—“Destruction, alteration, or\n  falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy”—\n  also points toward filekeeping rather than fish.

YATES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 25, 2015]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG announced the judgment of the\nCourt and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE, JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join.\n  John Yates, a commercial fisherman, caught undersized\nred grouper in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. To\nprevent federal authorities from confirming that he had\nharvested undersized fish, Yates ordered a crew member\nto toss the suspect catch into the sea. For this offense, he\nwas charged with, and convicted of, violating 18 U. S. C.\n§1519, which provides:\n       “Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates,\n    conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in\n    any record, document, or tangible object with the in-\n    tent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation\n    or proper administration of any matter within the ju-\n    risdiction of any department or agency of the United\n    States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to\n    or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be\n    fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20\n    years, or both.”\nYates was also indicted and convicted under §2232(a),\nwhich provides:\n2                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\n      “DESTRUCTION OR REMOVAL OF PROPERTY TO\n    PREVENT SEIZURE.—Whoever, before, during, or after\n    any search for or seizure of property by any person\n    authorized to make such search or seizure, knowingly\n    destroys, damages, wastes, disposes of, transfers, or\n    otherwise takes any action, or knowingly attempts to\n    destroy, damage, waste, dispose of, transfer, or other-\n    wise take any action, for the purpose of preventing or\n    impairing the Government’s lawful authority to take\n    such property into its custody or control or to continue\n    holding such property under its lawful custody and\n    control, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned\n    not more than 5 years, or both.”\nYates does not contest his conviction for violating\n§2232(a), but he maintains that fish are not trapped\nwithin the term “tangible object,” as that term is used in\n§1519.\n   Section 1519 was enacted as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, 116 Stat. 745, legislation designed to protect\ninvestors and restore trust in financial markets following\nthe collapse of Enron Corporation. A fish is no doubt an\nobject that is tangible; fish can be seen, caught, and\nhandled, and a catch, as this case illustrates, is vulnerable\nto destruction. But it would cut §1519 loose from its\nfinancial-fraud mooring to hold that it encompasses any\nand all objects, whatever their size or significance, de-\nstroyed with obstructive intent. Mindful that in Sarbanes-\nOxley, Congress trained its attention on corporate and\naccounting deception and cover-ups, we conclude that a\nmatching construction of §1519 is in order: A tangible\nobject captured by §1519, we hold, must be one used to\nrecord or preserve information.\n                            I\n  On August 23, 2007, the Miss Katie, a commercial fish-\ning boat, was six days into an expedition in the Gulf of\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nMexico. Her crew numbered three, including Yates, the\ncaptain. Engaged in a routine offshore patrol to inspect\nboth recreational and commercial vessels, Officer John\nJones of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Com-\nmission decided to board the Miss Katie to check on the\nvessel’s compliance with fishing rules. Although the Miss\nKatie was far enough from the Florida coast to be in exclu-\nsively federal waters, she was nevertheless within Officer\nJones’s jurisdiction. Because he had been deputized as a\nfederal agent by the National Marine Fisheries Service,\nOfficer Jones had authority to enforce federal, as well as\nstate, fishing laws.\n   Upon boarding the Miss Katie, Officer Jones noticed\nthree red grouper that appeared to be undersized hanging\nfrom a hook on the deck. At the time, federal conservation\nregulations required immediate release of red grouper less\nthan 20 inches long. 50 CFR §622.37(d)(2)(ii) (effective\nApril 2, 2007). Violation of those regulations is a civil\noffense punishable by a fine or fishing license suspension.\nSee 16 U. S. C. §§1857(1)(A), (G), 1858(a), (g).\n   Suspecting that other undersized fish might be on\nboard, Officer Jones proceeded to inspect the ship’s catch,\nsetting aside and measuring only fish that appeared to\nhim to be shorter than 20 inches. Officer Jones ultimately\ndetermined that 72 fish fell short of the 20-inch mark. A\nfellow officer recorded the length of each of the undersized\nfish on a catch measurement verification form. With few\nexceptions, the measured fish were between 19 and 20\ninches; three were less than 19 inches; none were less\nthan 18.75 inches. After separating the fish measuring\nbelow 20 inches from the rest of the catch by placing them\nin wooden crates, Officer Jones directed Yates to leave the\nfish, thus segregated, in the crates until the Miss Katie\nreturned to port. Before departing, Officer Jones issued\nYates a citation for possession of undersized fish.\n   Four days later, after the Miss Katie had docked in\n4                    YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nCortez, Florida, Officer Jones measured the fish contained\nin the wooden crates. This time, however, the measured\nfish, although still less than 20 inches, slightly exceeded\nthe lengths recorded on board. Jones surmised that the\nfish brought to port were not the same as those he had\ndetected during his initial inspection. Under questioning,\none of the crew members admitted that, at Yates’s direc-\ntion, he had thrown overboard the fish Officer Jones had\nmeasured at sea, and that he and Yates had replaced the\ntossed grouper with fish from the rest of the catch.\n   For reasons not disclosed in the record before us, more\nthan 32 months passed before criminal charges were\nlodged against Yates. On May 5, 2010, he was indicted for\ndestroying property to prevent a federal seizure, in viola-\ntion of §2232(a), and for destroying, concealing, and cover-\ning up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation, in\nviolation of §1519.1 By the time of the indictment, the\nminimum legal length for Gulf red grouper had been\nlowered from 20 inches to 18 inches. See 50 CFR\n§622.37(d)(2)(iv) (effective May 18, 2009). No measured\nfish in Yates’s catch fell below that limit. The record does\nnot reveal what civil penalty, if any, Yates received for his\npossession of fish undersized under the 2007 regulation.\nSee 16 U. S. C. §1858(a).\n   Yates was tried on the criminal charges in August 2011.\nAt the end of the Government’s case in chief, he moved for\na judgment of acquittal on the §1519 charge. Pointing to\n§1519’s title and its origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act, Yates argued that the section sets forth “a\ndocuments offense” and that its reference to “tangible\nobject[s]” subsumes “computer hard drives, logbooks, [and]\nthings of that nature,” not fish. App. 91–92. Yates\n——————\n  1 Yates was also charged with making a false statement to federal law\n\nenforcement officers, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1001(a)(2). That\ncharge, on which Yates was acquitted, is not relevant to our analysis.\n                   Cite as: 574 U.

App. 91. Section 2232(a), set out supra, at 1–2,\nfit that description. But §1519, Yates insisted, did not.\n   The Government countered that a “tangible object”\nwithin §1519’s compass is “simply something other than a\ndocument or record.” App. 93. The trial judge expressed\nmisgivings about reading “tangible object” as broadly as\nthe Government urged: “Isn’t there a Latin phrase [about]\nconstruction of a statute . . . . The gist of it is . . . you take\na look at [a] line of words, and you interpret the words\nconsistently. So if you’re talking about documents, and\nrecords, tangible objects are tangible objects in the nature\nof a document or a record, as opposed to a fish.” Ibid. The\nfirst-instance judge nonetheless followed controlling Elev-\nenth Circuit precedent. While recognizing that §1519 was\npassed as part of legislation targeting corporate fraud, the\nCourt of Appeals had instructed that “the broad language\nof §1519 is not limited to corporate fraud cases, and ‘Con-\ngress is free to pass laws with language covering areas\nwell beyond the particular crisis du jour that initially\nprompted legislative action.’ ”       No. 2:10–cr–66–FtM–\n29SPC (MD Fla., Aug. 8, 2011), App. 116 (quoting United\nStates v. Hunt, 526 F. 3d 739, 744 (CA11 2008)). Accord-\ningly, the trial court read “tangible object” as a term “in-\ndependent” of “record” or “document.” App. 116. For\nviolating §1519 and §2232(a), the court sentenced Yates to\nimprisonment for 30 days, followed by supervised release\nfor three years. App. 118–120. For life, he will bear the\nstigma of having a federal felony conviction.\n   On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit found the text of §1519\n“plain.” 733 F. 3d 1059, 1064 (2013). Because “tangible\nobject” was “undefined” in the statute, the Court of Ap-\npeals gave the term its “ordinary or natural meaning,” i.e.,\nits dictionary definition, “[h]aving or possessing physical\n6                 YATES v.

S. ___ (2014), and now\nreverse the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment.\n                              II\n   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the\nexposure of Enron’s massive accounting fraud and revela-\ntions that the company’s outside auditor, Arthur Andersen\nLLP, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminat-\ning documents.       The Government acknowledges that\n§1519 was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate\ndocument-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrong-\ndoing. Brief for United States 46. Prior law made it an\noffense to “intimidat[e], threate[n], or corruptly persuad[e]\nanother person” to shred documents. §1512(b) (emphasis\nadded). Section 1519 cured a conspicuous omission by\nimposing liability on a person who destroys records him-\nself. See S. Rep. No. 107–146, p. 14 (2002) (describing\n§1519 as “a new general anti shredding provision” and\nexplaining that “certain current provisions make it a\ncrime to persuade another person to destroy documents,\nbut not a crime to actually destroy the same documents\nyourself ”). The new section also expanded prior law by\nincluding within the provision’s reach “any matter within\nthe jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United\nStates.” Id., at 14–15.\n   In the Government’s view, §1519 extends beyond the\nprincipal evil motivating its passage. The words of §1519,\nthe Government argues, support reading the provision as\na general ban on the spoliation of evidence, covering all\nphysical items that might be relevant to any matter under\nfederal investigation.\n   Yates urges a contextual reading of §1519, tying “tangi-\nble object” to the surrounding words, the placement of the\nprovision within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and related\n                   Cite as: 574 U.

Section 1519, he\nmaintains, targets not all manner of evidence, but records,\ndocuments, and tangible objects used to preserve them,\ne.g., computers, servers, and other media on which infor-\nmation is stored.\n   We agree with Yates and reject the Government’s unre-\nstrained reading. “Tangible object” in §1519, we conclude,\nis better read to cover only objects one can use to record or\npreserve information, not all objects in the physical world.\n                              A\n   The ordinary meaning of an “object” that is “tangible,”\nas stated in dictionary definitions, is “a discrete . . . thing,”\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary 1555\n(2002), that “possess[es] physical form,” Black’s Law Dic-\ntionary 1683 (10th ed. 2014). From this premise, the\nGovernment concludes that “tangible object,” as that term\nappears in §1519, covers the waterfront, including fish\nfrom the sea.\n   Whether a statutory term is unambiguous, however,\ndoes not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its compo-\nnent words. Rather, “[t]he plainness or ambiguity of\nstatutory language is determined [not only] by reference to\nthe language itself, [but as well by] the specific context in\nwhich that language is used, and the broader context of\nthe statute as a whole.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU. S. 337, 341 (1997). See also Deal v. United States, 508\nU. S. 129, 132 (1993) (it is a “fundamental principle of\nstatutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself)\nthat the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isola-\ntion, but must be drawn from the context in which it is\nused”). Ordinarily, a word’s usage accords with its dic-\ntionary definition. In law as in life, however, the same\nwords, placed in different contexts, sometimes mean dif-\nferent things.\n8                YATES v.

That Rule requires the\nprosecution to grant a defendant’s request to inspect\n“tangible objects” within the Government’s control that\nhave utility for the defense. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n16(a)(1)(E).\n   Rule 16’s reference to “tangible objects” has been inter-\npreted to include any physical evidence. See 5 W. LaFave,\nJ. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §20.3(g),\npp. 405–406, and n. 120 (3d ed. 2007). Rule 16 is a discov-\nery rule designed to protect defendants by compelling the\nprosecution to turn over to the defense evidence material\nto the charges at issue. In that context, a comprehensive\nconstruction of “tangible objects” is fitting. In contrast,\n§1519 is a penal provision that refers to “tangible object”\nnot in relation to a request for information relevant to a\nspecific court proceeding, but rather in relation to federal\ninvestigations or proceedings of every kind, including\nthose not yet begun.3 See Commissioner v. National Car-\nbide Corp., 167 F. 2d 304, 306 (CA2 1948) (Hand, J.)\n——————\n  2 The  dissent assiduously ignores all this, post, at 11–12, in insisting\nthat Congress wrote §1519 to cover, along with shredded corporate\ndocuments, red grouper slightly smaller than the legal limit.\n  3 For the same reason, we do not think the meaning of “tangible ob-\n\njects” (or “tangible things,” see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)) in other\ndiscovery prescriptions cited by the Government leads to the conclusion\nthat “tangible object” in §1519 encompasses any and all physical\nevidence existing on land or in the sea.\n10               YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\n(“words are chameleons, which reflect the color of their\nenvironment”). Just as the context of Rule 16 supports\ngiving “tangible object” a meaning as broad as its diction-\nary definition, the context of §1519 tugs strongly in favor\nof a narrower reading.\n                              B\n   Familiar interpretive guides aid our construction of the\nwords “tangible object” as they appear in §1519.\n   We note first §1519’s caption: “Destruction, alteration,\nor falsification of records in Federal investigations and\nbankruptcy.” That heading conveys no suggestion that the\nsection prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evi-\ndence, however remote from records. Neither does the\ntitle of the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in which\n§1519 was placed, §802: “Criminal penalties for altering\ndocuments.” 116 Stat. 800. Furthermore, §1520, the only\nother provision passed as part of §802, is titled “Destruc-\ntion of corporate audit records” and addresses only that\nspecific subset of records and documents. While these\nheadings are not commanding, they supply cues that\nCongress did not intend “tangible object” in §1519 to\nsweep within its reach physical objects of every kind,\nincluding things no one would describe as records, docu-\nments, or devices closely associated with them. See\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 234\n(1998) (“[T]he title of a statute and the heading of a sec-\ntion are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about\nthe meaning of a statute.” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). If Congress indeed meant to make §1519 an all-\nencompassing ban on the spoliation of evidence, as the\ndissent believes Congress did, one would have expected a\nclearer indication of that intent.\n   Section 1519’s position within Chapter 73 of Title 18\nfurther signals that §1519 was not intended to serve as a\ncross-the-board ban on the destruction of physical evi-\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Congress placed §1519 (and its com-\npanion provision §1520) at the end of the chapter, follow-\ning immediately after the pre-existing §1516, §1517, and\n§1518, each of them prohibiting obstructive acts in specific\ncontexts. See §1516 (audits of recipients of federal funds);\n§1517 (federal examinations of financial institutions);\n§1518 (criminal investigations of federal health care of-\nfenses). See also S. Rep. No. 107–146, at 7 (observing that\n§1517 and §1518 “apply to obstruction in certain limited\ntypes of cases, such as bankruptcy fraud, examinations of\nfinancial institutions, and healthcare fraud”).\n   But Congress did not direct codification of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act’s other additions to Chapter 73 adjacent to these\nspecialized provisions. Instead, Congress directed place-\nment of those additions within or alongside retained pro-\nvisions that address obstructive acts relating broadly to\nofficial proceedings and criminal trials: Section 806, “Civil\nAction to protect against retaliation in fraud cases,” was\ncodified as §1514A and inserted between the pre-existing\n§1514, which addresses civil actions to restrain harass-\nment of victims and witnesses in criminal cases, and\n§1515, which defines terms used in §1512 and §1513.\nSection 1102, “Tampering with a record or otherwise\nimpeding an official proceeding,” was codified as §1512(c)\nand inserted within the pre-existing §1512, which ad-\ndresses tampering with a victim, witness, or informant to\nimpede any official proceeding. Section 1107, “Retaliation\nagainst informants,” was codified as §1513(e) and inserted\nwithin the pre-existing §1513, which addresses retaliation\nagainst a victim, witness, or informant in any official\nproceeding. Congress thus ranked §1519, not among the\nbroad proscriptions, but together with specialized provi-\nsions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial\naudits. This placement accords with the view that Con-\ngress’ conception of §1519’s coverage was considerably\n12                   YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nmore limited than the Government’s.4\n  The contemporaneous passage of §1512(c)(1), which was\ncontained in a section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act discrete\nfrom the section embracing §1519 and §1520, is also in-\nstructive. Section 1512(c)(1) provides:\n       “(c) Whoever corruptly—\n       “(1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record,\n    document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with\n    the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availabil-\n    ity for use in an official proceeding\n         .            .           .           .          .\n    “shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n    than 20 years, or both.”\n\nThe legislative history reveals that §1512(c)(1) was drafted\nand proposed after §1519. See 148 Cong. Rec. 12518,\n13088–13089 (2002). The Government argues, and Yates\ndoes not dispute, that §1512(c)(1)’s reference to “other\nobject” includes any and every physical object. But if\n§1519’s reference to “tangible object” already included all\nphysical objects, as the Government and the dissent con-\ntend, then Congress had no reason to enact §1512(c)(1):\nVirtually any act that would violate §1512(c)(1) no doubt\nwould violate §1519 as well, for §1519 applies to “the\n——————\n  4 The dissent contends that nothing can be drawn from the placement\n\nof §1519 because, before and after Sarbanes-Oxley, “all of Chapter 73\nwas ordered chronologically.” Post, at 9. The argument might have\nsome force if the factual premise were correct. In Sarbanes-Oxley,\nCongress directed insertion of §1514A before §1518, then the last\nsection in Chapter 73. If, as the dissent argues, Congress adopted\n§1519 to fill out §1512, post, at 6–7, it would have made more sense for\nCongress to codify the substance of §1519 within §1512 or in a new\n§1512A, rather than placing §1519 among specialized provisions.\nNotably, in Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress added §1512(c)(1), “a broad ban\non evidence-spoliation,” cf. post, at 9, n. 2, to §1512, even though\n§1512’s preexisting title and provisions all related to witness-\ntampering.\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

Nowhere does the Government explain\nwhat independent function §1512(c)(1) would serve if the\nGovernment is right about the sweeping scope of §1519.\nWe resist a reading of §1519 that would render superflu-\nous an entire provision passed in proximity as part of the\nsame Act.6 See Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U.

That suggestion, which, as one would expect,\nlacks the Government’s endorsement, does not withstand examination.\nThe Senate Committee Report on §1519, on which the dissent else-\nwhere relies, see post, at 6, explained that an obstructive act is within\n§1519’s scope if “done ‘in contemplation’ of or in relation to a matter or\ninvestigation.” S. Rep. 107–146, at 15. The Report further informed\nthat §1519 “is . . . meant to do away with the distinctions, which some\ncourts have read into obstruction statutes, between court proceedings,\ninvestigations, regulatory or administrative proceedings (whether\nformal or not), and less formal government inquiries, regardless of their\ntitle.” Ibid. If any doubt remained about the multiplicity of contexts in\nwhich §1519 was designed to apply, the Report added, “[t]he intent of\nthe provision is simple; people should not be destroying, altering, or\nfalsifying documents to obstruct any government function.” Ibid.\n   6 Furthermore, if “tangible object” in §1519 is read to include any\n\nphysical object, §1519 would prohibit all of the conduct proscribed by\n§2232(a), which imposes a maximum penalty of five years in prison for\ndestroying or removing “property” to prevent its seizure by the Gov-\nernment.

Alloyd Co., 513 U. S.\n561, 575 (1995), we rely on the principle of noscitur a\nsociis—a word is known by the company it keeps—to\n“avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is\ninconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving\nunintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted). See also United States v. Wil-\nliams, 553 U. S. 285, 294 (2008) (“a word is given more\nprecise content by the neighboring words with which it is\nassociated”). In Gustafson, we interpreted the word\n“communication” in §2(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 to\nrefer to a public communication, rather than any commu-\nnication, because the word appeared in a list with other\nwords, notably “notice, circular, [and] advertisement,”\nmaking it “apparent that the list refer[red] to documents\nof wide dissemination.” 513 U. S., at 575–576. And we did\nso even though the list began with the word “any.”\n   The noscitur a sociis canon operates in a similar manner\nhere. “Tangible object” is the last in a list of terms that\nbegins “any record [or] document.” The term is therefore\nappropriately read to refer, not to any tangible object, but\nspecifically to the subset of tangible objects involving\nrecords and documents, i.e., objects used to record or\npreserve information.      See United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual §2J1.2, comment., n. 1\n(Nov. 2014) (“ ‘Records, documents, or tangible objects’\nincludes (A) records, documents, or tangible objects that\nare stored on, or that are, magnetic, optical, digital, other\nelectronic, or other storage mediums or devices; and (B)\nwire or electronic communications.”).\n   This moderate interpretation of “tangible object” accords\nwith the list of actions §1519 proscribes. The section\napplies to anyone who “alters, destroys, mutilates, con-\nceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any\nrecord, document, or tangible object” with the requisite\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

The last two verbs,\n“falsif[y]” and “mak[e] a false entry in,” typically take as\ngrammatical objects records, documents, or things used to\nrecord or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard\ndrives. See, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 720 (10th ed.\n2014) (defining “falsify” as “[t]o make deceptive; to coun-\nterfeit, forge, or misrepresent; esp., to tamper with (a\ndocument, record, etc.)”). It would be unnatural, for ex-\nample, to describe a killer’s act of wiping his fingerprints\nfrom a gun as “falsifying” the murder weapon. But it\nwould not be strange to refer to “falsifying” data stored on\na hard drive as simply “falsifying” a hard drive. Further-\nmore, Congress did not include on §1512(c)(1)’s list of\nprohibited actions “falsifies” or “makes a false entry in.”\nSee §1512(c)(1) (making it unlawful to “alte[r], destro[y],\nmutilat[e], or concea[l] a record, document, or other object”\nwith the requisite obstructive intent). That contempora-\nneous omission also suggests that Congress intended\n“tangible object” in §1519 to have a narrower scope than\n“other object” in §1512(c)(1).7\n  A canon related to noscitur a sociis, ejusdem generis,\ncounsels: “Where general words follow specific words in a\n\n——————\n  7 The dissent contends that “record, document, or tangible object” in\n§1519 should be construed in conformity with “record, document, or\nother object” in §1512(c)(1) because both provisions address “the same\nbasic problem.” Post, at 11–12. But why should that be so when\nCongress prohibited in §1519 additional actions, specific to paper and\nelectronic documents and records, actions it did not prohibit in\n§1512(c)(1)? When Congress passed Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002, courts\nhad already interpreted the phrase “alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal\nan object” in §1512(b)(2)(B) to apply to all types of physical evidence.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Applewhaite, 195 F. 3d 679, 688 (CA3 1999)\n(affirming conviction under §1512(b)(2)(B) for persuading another\nperson to paint over blood spatter). Congress’ use of a formulation in\n§1519 that did not track the one used in §1512(b)(2)(B) (and repeated in\n§1512(c)(1)) suggests that Congress designed §1519 to be interpreted\napart from §1512, not in lockstep with it.\n16                YATES v.

S. 137, 142–143 (2008), for example, we\nrelied on this principle to determine what crimes were\ncovered by the statutory phrase “any crime . . . that . . . is\nburglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or\notherwise involves conduct that presents a serious poten-\ntial risk of physical injury to another,” 18 U. S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The enumeration of specific crimes, we\nexplained, indicates that the “otherwise involves” provi-\nsion covers “only similar crimes, rather than every crime\nthat ‘presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.’ ” 553 U. S., at 142. Had Congress intended the\nlatter “all encompassing” meaning, we observed, “it is hard\nto see why it would have needed to include the examples\nat all.” Ibid. See also CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept.\nof Revenue, 562 U. S. 277, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16) (“We\ntypically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general\nword will not render specific words meaningless.”). Just\nso here. Had Congress intended “tangible object” in §1519\nto be interpreted so generically as to capture physical\nobjects as dissimilar as documents and fish, Congress\nwould have had no reason to refer specifically to “record”\nor “document.” The Government’s unbounded reading of\n“tangible object” would render those words misleading\nsurplusage.\n   Having used traditional tools of statutory interpretation\nto examine markers of congressional intent within the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act and §1519 itself, we are persuaded\nthat an aggressive interpretation of “tangible object” must\nbe rejected.

The MPC provision and pro-\nposals prompted by it would have imposed liability on\nanyone who “alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, or re-\nmoves a record, document or thing.” See ALI, MPC\n§241.7(1), p. 175 (1962). Those proscriptions were under-\nstood to refer to all physical evidence. See MPC §241.7,\nComment 3, at 179 (1980) (provision “applies to any physi-\ncal object”). Accordingly, the Government reasons, and\nthe dissent exuberantly agrees, post, at 4–5, Congress\nmust have intended §1519 to apply to the universe of\nphysical evidence.\n   The inference is unwarranted. True, the 1962 MPC\nprovision prohibited tampering with any kind of physical\nevidence. But unlike §1519, the MPC provision did not\nprohibit actions that specifically relate to records, docu-\nments, and objects used to record or preserve information.\nThe MPC provision also ranked the offense as a misde-\nmeanor and limited liability to instances in which the\nactor “believ[es] that an official proceeding or investigation\nis pending or about to be instituted.” MPC §241.7(1), at\n175. Yates would have had scant reason to anticipate a\nfelony prosecution, and certainly not one instituted at a\ntime when even the smallest of the fish he caught came\nwithin the legal limit. See supra, at 4; cf. Bond v. United\nStates, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014), (slip op., at 14) (rejecting\n“boundless reading” of a statutory term given “deeply\nserious consequences” that reading would entail).

See Final Report of the National Commission\non Reform of Federal Criminal Laws §1323, pp. 116–117\n(1971).\n   Section 1519 conspicuously lacks the limits built into\nthe MPC provision and the federal proposal. It describes\nnot a misdemeanor, but a felony punishable by up to 20\nyears in prison. And the section covers conduct intended\nto impede any federal investigation or proceeding, includ-\ning one not even on the verge of commencement. Given\nthese significant differences, the meaning of “record,\ndocument, or thing” in the MPC provision and a kindred\nproposal is not a reliable indicator of the meaning Con-\ngress assigned to “record, document, or tangible object” in\n§1519. The MPC provision, in short, tells us neither “what\nCongress wrote [nor] what Congress wanted,” cf. post, at\n15, concerning Yates’s small fish as the subject of a federal\nfelony prosecution.\n                             C\n  Finally, if our recourse to traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction leaves any doubt about the meaning of “tan-\ngible object,” as that term is used in §1519, we would\ninvoke the rule that “ambiguity concerning the ambit of\ncriminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.”\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000) (quot-\ning Rewis v. United States, 401 U. S. 808, 812 (1971)).\nThat interpretative principle is relevant here, where the\nGovernment urges a reading of §1519 that exposes indi-\nviduals to 20-year prison sentences for tampering with any\nphysical object that might have evidentiary value in any\nfederal investigation into any offense, no matter whether\nthe investigation is pending or merely contemplated, or\nwhether the offense subject to investigation is criminal or\ncivil. See Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 427\n(1985) (“Application of the rule of lenity ensures that\ncriminal statutes will provide fair warning concerning\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

In determining the mean-\ning of “tangible object” in §1519, “it is appropriate, before\nwe choose the harsher alternative, to require that Con-\ngress should have spoken in language that is clear and\ndefinite.” See Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 25 (quoting United\nStates v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., 344 U. S. 218, 222\n(1952)). See also Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848,\n858–859 (2000) (rule of lenity “reinforces” the conclusion\nthat arson of an owner-occupied residence is not subject to\nfederal prosecution under 18 U. S. C. §844(i) because such\na residence does not qualify as property “used in” com-\nmerce or commerce-affecting activity).8\n\n——————\n  8 The dissent cites United States v. McRae, 702 F. 3d 806, 834–838\n\n(CA5 2012), United States v. Maury, 695 F. 3d 227, 243–244 (CA3\n2012), and United States v. Natal, 2014 U. S. Dist.

Those cases supply no cause for concern\nthat persons who commit “major” obstructive acts, id. at 18, will go\nunpunished. The defendant in McRae, a police officer who seized a car\ncontaining a corpse and then set it on fire, was also convicted for that\nconduct under 18 U. S. C. §844(h) and sentenced to a term of 120\nmonths’ imprisonment for that offense. See 702 F. 3d, at 817–818, 839–\n840. The defendant in Natal, who repainted a van to cover up evidence\nof a fatal arson, was also convicted of three counts of violating 18\nU. S. C. §3 and sentenced to concurrent terms of 174 months’ impris-\nonment. See Judgment in United States v. Morales, No. 3:12–cr–164\n(Conn., Jan. 12, 2015). And the defendant in Maury, a company con-\nvicted under §1519 of concealing evidence that a cement mixer’s safety\nlock was disabled when a worker’s fingers were amputated, was also\nconvicted of numerous other violations, including three counts of\nviolating 18 U.

YATES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [February 25, 2015]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.\n   This case can and should be resolved on narrow\ngrounds. And though the question is close, traditional\ntools of statutory construction confirm that John Yates has\nthe better of the argument. Three features of 18 U. S. C.\n§1519 stand out to me: the statute’s list of nouns, its list of\nverbs, and its title. Although perhaps none of these fea-\ntures by itself would tip the case in favor of Yates, the\nthree combined do so.\n   Start with the nouns. Section 1519 refers to “any rec-\nord, document, or tangible object.” The noscitur a sociis\ncanon instructs that when a statute contains a list, each\nword in that list presumptively has a “similar” meaning.\nSee, e.g., Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 576\n(1995). A related canon, ejusdem generis teaches that\ngeneral words following a list of specific words should\nusually be read in light of those specific words to mean\nsomething “similar.” See, e.g., Christopher v. SmithKline\nBeecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 18).\nApplying these canons to §1519’s list of nouns, the term\n“tangible object” should refer to something similar to\nrecords or documents. A fish does not spring to mind—nor\ndoes an antelope, a colonial farmhouse, a hydrofoil, or an\noil derrick. All are “objects” that are “tangible.” But who\nwouldn’t raise an eyebrow if a neighbor, when asked to\nidentify something similar to a “record” or “document,”\n2                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsaid “crocodile”?\n   This reading, of course, has its shortcomings. For in-\nstance, this is an imperfect ejusdem generis case because\n“record” and “document” are themselves quite general.\nAnd there is a risk that “tangible object” may be made\nsuperfluous—what is similar to a “record” or “document”\nbut yet is not one? An e-mail, however, could be such a\nthing. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guide-\nlines Manual §2J1.2 and comment. (Nov. 2003) (reading\n“records, documents, or tangible objects” to “includ[e]” what\nis found on “magnetic, optical, digital, other electronic,\nor other storage mediums or devices”). An e-mail, after\nall, might not be a “document” if, as was “traditionally” so,\na document was a “piece of paper with information on it,”\nnot “information stored on a computer, electronic storage\ndevice, or any other medium.” Black’s Law Dictionary\n587–588 (10th ed. 2014). E-mails might also not be “rec-\nords” if records are limited to “minutes” or other formal\nwritings “designed to memorialize [past] events.” Id., at\n1465. A hard drive, however, is tangible and can contain\nfiles that are precisely akin to even these narrow defini-\ntions. Both “record” and “document” can be read more\nexpansively, but adding “tangible object” to §1519 would\nensure beyond question that electronic files are included.\nTo be sure, “tangible object” presumably can capture more\nthan just e-mails; Congress enacts “catchall[s]” for “known\nunknowns.” Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. 848, 860\n(2009). But where noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\napply, “known unknowns” should be similar to known\nknowns, i.e., here, records and documents. This is espe-\ncially true because reading “tangible object” too broadly\ncould render “record” and “document” superfluous.\n   Next, consider §1519’s list of verbs: “alters, destroys,\nmutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false\nentry in.” Although many of those verbs could apply to\nnouns as far-flung as salamanders, satellites, or sand\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndunes, the last phrase in the list—“makes a false entry\nin”—makes no sense outside of filekeeping. How does one\nmake a false entry in a fish? “Alters” and especially “falsi-\nfies” are also closely associated with filekeeping. Not one\nof the verbs, moreover, cannot be applied to filekeeping—\ncertainly not in the way that “makes a false entry in” is\nalways inconsistent with the aquatic.\n   Again, the Government is not without a response. One\ncan imagine Congress trying to write a law so broadly that\nnot every verb lines up with every noun. But failure to\n“line up” may suggest that something has gone awry in\none’s interpretation of a text. Where, as here, each of a\nstatute’s verbs applies to a certain category of nouns, there\nis some reason to think that Congress had that category in\nmind. Categories, of course, are often underinclusive or\noverinclusive—§1519, for instance, applies to a bomb-\nthreatening letter but not a bomb. But this does not mean\nthat categories are not useful or that Congress does not\nenact them. See, e.g., Vance v. Bradley, 440 U. S. 93, 108–\n109 (1979). Here, focusing on the verbs, the category of\nnouns appears to be filekeeping. This observation is not\ndispositive, but neither is it nothing. The Government\nalso contends that §1519’s verbs cut both ways because it\nis unnatural to apply “falsifies” to tangible objects, and\nthat is certainly true. One does not falsify the outside\ncasing of a hard drive, but one could falsify or alter data\nphysically recorded on that hard drive.\n   Finally, my analysis is influenced by §1519’s title: “De-\nstruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal\ninvestigations and bankruptcy.” (Emphasis added.) This\ntoo points toward filekeeping, not fish. Titles can be use-\nful devices to resolve “ ‘doubt about the meaning of a stat-\nute.’ ” Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 527–528 (2002)\n(quoting Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S.\n224, 234 (1998)); see also Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U. S.\n___, ___–___ (2014) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\n4                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nat 4–6). The title is especially valuable here because it\nreinforces what the text’s nouns and verbs independently\nsuggest—that no matter how other statutes might be read,\nthis particular one does not cover every noun in the uni-\nverse with tangible form.\n   Titles, of course, are also not dispositive. Here, if the\nlist of nouns did not already suggest that “tangible object”\nshould mean something similar to records or documents,\nespecially when read in conjunction with §1519’s peculiar\nlist of verbs with their focus on filekeeping, then the title\nwould not be enough on its own. In conjunction with those\nother two textual features, however, the Government’s\nargument, though colorable, becomes too implausible to\naccept. See, e.g., Washington State Dept. of Social and\nHealth Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U. S.\n371, 384–385 (2003) (focusing on the “product of [two]\ncanons of construction” which was “confirmed” by other\ninterpretative evidence); cf. Al-Adahi v.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                     [February 25, 2015]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE\nKENNEDY, and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.\n   A criminal law, 18 U. S. C. §1519, prohibits tampering\nwith “any record, document, or tangible object” in an\nattempt to obstruct a federal investigation. This case\nraises the question whether the term “tangible object”\nmeans the same thing in §1519 as it means in everyday\nlanguage—any object capable of being touched. The an-\nswer should be easy: Yes. The term “tangible object” is\nbroad, but clear. Throughout the U. S. Code and many\nStates’ laws, it invariably covers physical objects of all\nkinds. And in §1519, context confirms what bare text\nsays: All the words surrounding “tangible object” show\nthat Congress meant the term to have a wide range. That\nfits with Congress’s evident purpose in enacting §1519: to\npunish those who alter or destroy physical evidence—any\nphysical evidence—with the intent of thwarting federal\nlaw enforcement.\n   The plurality instead interprets “tangible object” to\ncover “only objects one can use to record or preserve in-\nformation.” Ante, at 7. The concurring opinion similarly,\nif more vaguely, contends that “tangible object” should\nrefer to “something similar to records or documents”—and\nshouldn’t include colonial farmhouses, crocodiles, or fish.\nAnte, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). In my view,\nconventional tools of statutory construction all lead to a\n2                      YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmore conventional result: A “tangible object” is an object\nthat’s tangible. I would apply the statute that Congress\nenacted and affirm the judgment below.\n                               I\n   While the plurality starts its analysis with §1519’s\nheading, see ante, at 10 (“We note first §1519’s caption”), I\nwould begin with §1519’s text. When Congress has not\nsupplied a definition, we generally give a statutory term\nits ordinary meaning. See, e.g., Schindler Elevator Corp.\nv. United States ex rel. Kirk, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 5). As the plurality must acknowledge, the ordi-\nnary meaning of “tangible object” is “a discrete thing that\npossesses physical form.” Ante, at 7 (punctuation and\ncitation omitted). A fish is, of course, a discrete thing that\npossesses physical form. See generally Dr. Seuss, One\nFish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (1960). So the ordinary\nmeaning of the term “tangible object” in §1519, as no\none here disputes, covers fish (including too-small red\ngrouper).\n   That interpretation accords with endless uses of the\nterm in statute and rule books as construed by courts.\nDozens of federal laws and rules of procedure (and hun-\ndreds of state enactments) include the term “tangible\nobject” or its first cousin “tangible thing”—some in associ-\nation with documents, others not. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C.\n§8302(2) (referring to “any material or tangible object that\ncould harbor a pest or disease”); 15 U. S. C. §57b–1(c)\n(authorizing investigative demands for “documentary\nmaterial or tangible things”); 18 U. S. C. §668(a)(1)(D)\n(defining “museum” as entity that owns “tangible objects\nthat are exhibited to the public”); 28 U. S. C. §2507(b)\n(allowing discovery of “relevant facts, books, papers, doc-\numents or tangible things”).1 To my knowledge, no court\n——————\n    1 From   Alabama and Alaska through Wisconsin and Wyoming (and\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

For example, courts have understood the\nphrases “tangible objects” and “tangible things” in the\nFederal Rules of Criminal and Civil Procedure to cover\neverything from guns to drugs to machinery to . . . ani-\nmals. See, e.g., United States v. Obiukwu, 17 F. 3d 816,\n819 (CA6 1994) (per curiam) (handgun); United States v.\nAcarino, 270 F. Supp. 526, 527–528 (EDNY 1967) (heroin);\nIn re Newman, 782 F. 2d 971, 972–975 (CA Fed. 1986)\n(energy generation system); Martin v. Reynolds Metals\nCorp., 297 F. 2d 49, 56–57 (CA9 1961) (cattle). No sur-\nprise, then, that—until today—courts have uniformly\napplied the term “tangible object” in §1519 in the same\nway. See, e.g., United States v. McRae, 702 F. 3d 806,\n834–838 (CA5 2012) (corpse); United States v. Maury, 695\nF. 3d 227, 243–244 (CA3 2012) (cement mixer).\n  That is not necessarily the end of the matter; I agree\nwith the plurality (really, who does not?) that context\nmatters in interpreting statutes. We do not “construe the\nmeaning of statutory terms in a vacuum.” Tyler v. Cain,\n533 U. S. 656, 662 (2001). Rather, we interpret particular\nwords “in their context and with a view to their place in\nthe overall statutory scheme.” Davis v. Michigan Dept. of\nTreasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989). And sometimes that\n——————\ntrust me—in all that come between), States similarly use the terms\n“tangible objects” and “tangible things” in statutes and rules of all\nsorts. See, e.g., Ala. Code §34–17–1(3) (2010) (defining “landscape\narchitecture” to include the design of certain “tangible objects and\nfeatures”); Alaska Rule Civ. Proc. 34(a)(1) (2014) (allowing litigants to\n“inspect, copy, test, or sample any tangible things” that constitute or\ncontain discoverable material); Wis. Stat. §804.09(1) (2014) (requiring\nthe production of “designated tangible things” in civil proceedings);\nWyo. Rule Crim. Proc. 41(h) (2014) (defining “property” for purposes of\na search-and-seizure statute to include “documents, books, papers and\nany other tangible objects”).\n4                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmeans, as the plurality says, that the dictionary definition\nof a disputed term cannot control. See, e.g., Bloate v.\nUnited States, 559 U. S. 196, 205, n. 9 (2010). But this is\nnot such an occasion, for here the text and its context\npoint the same way. Stepping back from the words “tan-\ngible object” provides only further evidence that Congress\nsaid what it meant and meant what it said.\n  Begin with the way the surrounding words in §1519\nreinforce the breadth of the term at issue. Section 1519\nrefers to “any” tangible object, thus indicating (in line with\nthat word’s plain meaning) a tangible object “of whatever\nkind.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 97\n(2002). This Court has time and again recognized that\n“any” has “an expansive meaning,” bringing within a\nstatute’s reach all types of the item (here, “tangible ob-\nject”) to which the law refers. Department of Housing and\nUrban Development v. Rucker, 535 U. S. 125, 131 (2002);\nsee, e.g., Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. 848, 856\n(2009); Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214,\n219–220 (2008). And the adjacent laundry list of verbs in\n§1519 (“alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up,\nfalsifies, or makes a false entry”) further shows that Con-\ngress wrote a statute with a wide scope. Those words are\nsupposed to ensure—just as “tangible object” is meant to—\nthat §1519 covers the whole world of evidence-tampering,\nin all its prodigious variety. See United States v. Rodgers,\n466 U. S. 475, 480 (1984) (rejecting a “narrow, technical\ndefinition” of a statutory term when it “clashes strongly”\nwith “sweeping” language in the same sentence).\n  Still more, “tangible object” appears as part of a three-\nnoun phrase (including also “records” and “documents”)\ncommon to evidence-tampering laws and always under-\nstood to embrace things of all kinds. The Model Penal\nCode’s evidence-tampering section, drafted more than 50\nyears ago, similarly prohibits a person from “alter[ing],\ndestroy[ing], conceal[ing] or remov[ing] any record, docu-\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            5\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nment or thing” in an effort to thwart an official investiga-\ntion or proceeding. ALI, Model Penal Code §241.7(1),\np. 175 (1962) (emphasis added). The Code’s commentary\nemphasizes that the offense described in that provision is\n“not limited to conduct that [alters] a written instrument.”\nId., §241.7, Comment 3, at 179. Rather, the language\nextends to “any physical object.” Ibid. Consistent with\nthat statement—and, of course, with ordinary meaning—\ncourts in the more than 15 States that have laws based on\nthe Model Code’s tampering provision apply them to all\ntangible objects, including drugs, guns, vehicles and . . .\nyes, animals. See, e.g., State v. Majors, 318 S. W. 3d 850,\n859–861 (Tenn. 2010) (cocaine); Puckett v. State, 328 Ark.\n355, 357–360, 944 S. W. 2d 111, 113–114 (1997) (gun);\nState v. Bruno, 236 Conn. 514, 519–520, 673 A. 2d 1117,\n1122–1123 (1996) (bicycle, skeleton, blood stains); State v.\nCrites, 2007 Mont. Dist. LEXIS 615, *5–*7 (Dec. 21, 2007)\n(deer antlers). Not a one has limited the phrase’s scope to\nobjects that record or preserve information.\n   The words “record, document, or tangible object” in\n§1519 also track language in 18 U. S. C. §1512, the federal\nwitness-tampering law covering (as even the plurality\naccepts, see ante, at 12) physical evidence in all its forms.\nSection 1512, both in its original version (preceding §1519)\nand today, repeatedly uses the phrase “record, document,\nor other object”—most notably, in a provision prohibiting\nthe use of force or threat to induce another person to\nwithhold any of those materials from an official proceed-\ning. §4(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of\n1982, 96 Stat. 1249, as amended, 18 U. S. C. §1512(b)(2).\nThat language, which itself likely derived from the Model\nPenal Code, encompasses no less the bloody knife than the\nincriminating letter, as all courts have for decades agreed.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Kellington, 217 F. 3d 1084, 1088\n(CA9 2000) (boat); United States v. Applewhaite, 195 F. 3d\n679, 688 (CA3 1999) (stone wall). And typically “only the\n6                 YATES v.

Communication Workers v. Beck, 487 U. S. 735, 754\n(1988); see A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts 252 (2012). Context thus\nagain confirms what text indicates.\n   And legislative history, for those who care about it, puts\nextra icing on a cake already frosted. Section 1519, as the\nplurality notes, see ante, at 2, 6, was enacted after the\nEnron Corporation’s collapse, as part of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002, 116 Stat. 745. But the provision began\nits life in a separate bill, and the drafters emphasized that\nEnron was “only a case study exposing the shortcomings\nin our current laws” relating to both “corporate and crimi-\nnal” fraud. S. Rep. No. 107–146, pp. 2, 11 (2002). The\nprimary “loophole[ ]” Congress identified, see id., at 14,\narose from limits in the part of §1512 just described: That\nprovision, as uniformly construed, prohibited a person\nfrom inducing another to destroy “record[s], document[s],\nor other object[s]”—of every type—but not from doing so\nhimself. §1512(b)(2); see supra, at 5. Congress (as even\nthe plurality agrees, see ante, at 6) enacted §1519 to close\nthat yawning gap. But §1519 could fully achieve that goal\nonly if it covered all the records, documents, and objects\n§1512 did, as well as all the means of tampering with\nthem. And so §1519 was written to do exactly that—“to\napply broadly to any acts to destroy or fabricate physical\nevidence,” as long as performed with the requisite intent.\nS. Rep. No. 107–146, at 14. “When a person destroys\nevidence,” the drafters explained, “overly technical legal\ndistinctions should neither hinder nor prevent prosecu-\ntion.” Id., at 7. Ah well: Congress, meet today’s Court,\nwhich here invents just such a distinction with just such\nan effect. See United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank,\n374 U. S. 321, 343 (1963) (“[C]reat[ing] a large loophole in\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

A person who hides\na murder victim’s body is no less culpable than one who\nburns the victim’s diary. A fisherman, like John Yates,\nwho dumps undersized fish to avoid a fine is no less\nblameworthy than one who shreds his vessel’s catch log\nfor the same reason. Congress thus treated both offenders\nin the same way. It understood, in enacting §1519, that\ndestroying evidence is destroying evidence, whether or not\nthat evidence takes documentary form.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   The plurality searches far and wide for anything—\nanything—to support its interpretation of §1519. But its\nfishing expedition comes up empty.\n   The plurality’s analysis starts with §1519’s title: “De-\nstruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal\ninvestigations and bankruptcy.” See ante, at 10; see also\nante, at 3–4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). That’s already a sign\nsomething is amiss. I know of no other case in which we\nhave begun our interpretation of a statute with the title,\nor relied on a title to override the law’s clear terms. In-\nstead, we have followed “the wise rule that the title of a\nstatute and the heading of a section cannot limit the plain\nmeaning of the text.” Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio\nR. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528–529 (1947).\n   The reason for that “wise rule” is easy to see: A title is,\nalmost necessarily, an abridgment. Attempting to men-\ntion every term in a statute “would often be ungainly as\nwell as useless”; accordingly, “matters in the text . . . are\nfrequently unreflected in the headings.” Id., at 528. Just\nlast year, this Court observed that two titles in a nearby\n8                 YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nsection of Sarbanes-Oxley serve as “but a short-hand\nreference to the general subject matter” of the provision at\nissue, “not meant to take the place of the detailed provi-\nsions of the text.” Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 16) (quoting Trainmen, 331 U. S., at\n528). The “under-inclusiveness” of the headings, we stated,\nwas “apparent.” Lawson, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n16). So too for §1519’s title, which refers to “destruction,\nalteration, or falsification” but not to mutilation, conceal-\nment, or covering up, and likewise mentions “records” but\nnot other documents or objects. Presumably, the plurality\nwould not refuse to apply §1519 when a person only con-\nceals evidence rather than destroying, altering, or falsify-\ning it; instead, the plurality would say that a title is just a\ntitle, which cannot “undo or limit” more specific statutory\ntext. Ibid. (quoting Trainmen, 331 U. S., at 529). The\nsame holds true when the evidence in question is not a\n“record” but something else whose destruction, alteration,\netc., is intended to obstruct justice.\n   The plurality next tries to divine meaning from §1519’s\n“position within Chapter 73 of Title 18.” Ante, at 10. But\nthat move is yet odder than the last. As far as I can tell,\nthis Court has never once suggested that the section num-\nber assigned to a law bears upon its meaning. Cf. Scalia,\nsupra, at xi–xvi (listing more than 50 interpretive princi-\nples and canons without mentioning the plurality’s new\nnumber-in-the-Code theory). And even on its own terms,\nthe plurality’s argument is hard to fathom. The plurality\nclaims that if §1519 applied to objects generally, Congress\nwould not have placed it “after the pre-existing §1516,\n§1517, and §1518” because those are “specialized provi-\nsions.” Ante, at 11. But search me if I can find a better\nplace for a broad ban on evidence-tampering. The plural-\nity seems to agree that the law properly goes in Chapter\n73—the criminal code’s chapter on “obstruction of justice.”\nBut the provision does not logically fit into any of that\n                     Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)                     9\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nchapter’s pre-existing sections. And with the first 18\nnumbers of the chapter already taken (starting with §1501\nand continuing through §1518), the law naturally took the\n19th place. That is standard operating procedure. Prior\nto the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, all of Chapter 73 was\nordered chronologically: Section 1518 was later enacted\nthan §1517, which was later enacted than §1516, which\nwas . . . well, you get the idea. And after Sarbanes-Oxley,\nCongress has continued in the same vein. Section 1519 is\nthus right where you would expect it (as is the contempo-\nraneously passed §1520)—between §1518 (added in 1996)\nand §1521 (added in 2008).2\n  The plurality’s third argument, relying on the surplus-\nage canon, at least invokes a known tool of statutory\nconstruction—but it too comes to nothing. Says the plu-\nrality: If read naturally, §1519 “would render superfluous”\n§1512(c)(1), which Congress passed “as part of the same\nact.” Ante, at 13. But that is not so: Although the two\nprovisions significantly overlap, each applies to conduct\nthe other does not. The key difference between the two is\nthat §1519 protects the integrity of “matter[s] within the\njurisdiction of any [federal] department or agency” whereas\n§1512(c)(1) safeguards “official proceeding[s]” as defined\nin §1515(a)(1)(A). Section 1519’s language often applies\nmore broadly than §1512(c)(1)’s, as the plurality notes.\n——————\n  2 The lonesome exception to Chapter 73’s chronological order is\n\n§1514A, added in Sarbanes-Oxley to create a civil action to protect\nwhistleblowers. Congress decided to place that provision right after the\nonly other section in Chapter 73 to authorize a civil action (that one to\nprotect victims and witnesses). The plurality, seizing on the §1514\nexample, says it likewise “would have made more sense for Congress to\ncodify the substance of §1519 within §1512 or in a new §1512A.” Ante,\nat 12, n. 4. But §1512 is titled “Tampering with a witness, victim, or an\ninformant,” and its provisions almost all protect witnesses from intimi-\ndation and harassment. It makes perfect sense that Congress wanted a\nbroad ban on evidence-spoliation to stand on its own rather than as\npart of—or an appendage to—a witness-tampering provision.\n10                    YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nFor example, an FBI investigation counts as a matter\nwithin a federal department’s jurisdiction, but falls out-\nside the statutory definition of “official proceeding” as\nconstrued by courts. See, e.g., United States v. Gabriel,\n125 F. 3d 89, 105, n. 13 (CA2 1997). But conversely,\n§1512(c)(1) sometimes reaches more widely than §1519.\nFor example, because an “official proceeding” includes any\n“proceeding before a judge or court of the United States,”\n§1512(c)(1) prohibits tampering with evidence in federal\nlitigation between private parties. See §1515(a)(1)(A);\nUnited States v. Burge, 711 F. 3d 803, 808–810 (CA7\n2013); United States v. Reich, 479 F. 3d 179, 185–187 (CA2\n2007) (Sotomayor, J.). By contrast, §1519 wouldn’t ordi-\nnarily operate in that context because a federal court isn’t\na “department or agency.” See Hubbard v. United States,\n514 U. S. 695, 715 (1995).3 So the surplusage canon\ndoesn’t come into play.4 Overlap—even significant over-\nlap—abounds in the criminal law. See Loughrin v. United\n\n——————\n  3 The plurality’s objection to this statement is difficult to understand.\n\nIt cannot take issue with Hubbard’s holding that “a federal court is\nneither a ‘department’ nor an ‘agency’ ” in a statute referring, just as\n§1519 does, to “any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or\nagency of the United States.” 514 U. S., at 698, 715. So the plurality\nsuggests that the phrase “in relation to . . . any such matter” in §1519\nsomehow changes Hubbard’s result. See ante, at 12–13, and n. 5. But\nthat phrase still demands that evidence-tampering relate to a “matter\nwithin the jurisdiction of any department or agency”—excluding courts,\nas Hubbard commands. That is why the federal government, as far as\nI can tell, has never once brought a prosecution under §1519 for\nevidence-tampering in litigation between private parties. It instead uses\n§1512(c)(1) for that purpose.\n  4 Section 1512(c)(1) also applies more broadly than §1519 in proceed-\n\nings relating to insurance regulation. The term “official proceeding” in\n§1512(c)(1) is defined to include “proceeding[s] involving the business of\ninsurance whose activities affect interstate commerce before any\ninsurance regulatory official or agency.” §1515(a)(1)(D). But §1519\nwouldn’t usually apply in that context because state, not federal,\nagencies handle most insurance regulation.\n                   Cite as: 574 U.

This Court has never thought that of such ordinary\nstuff surplusage is made. See ibid.; Connecticut Nat. Bank\nv. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992).\n   And the legislative history to which the plurality ap-\npeals, see ante, at 6, only cuts against it because those\nmaterials show that lawmakers knew that §1519 and\n§1512(c)(1) share much common ground. Minority Leader\nLott introduced the amendment that included §1512(c)(1)\n(along with other criminal and corporate fraud provisions)\nlate in the legislative process, explaining that he did so at\nthe specific request of the President. See 148 Cong. Rec.\n12509, 12512 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Lott). Not only Lott\nbut several other Senators noted the overlap between the\nPresident’s package and provisions already in the bill,\nmost notably §1519. See id., at 12512 (remarks of Sen.\nLott); id., at 12513 (remarks of Sen. Biden); id., at 12517\n(remarks of Sens. Hatch and Gramm). The presence of\nboth §1519 and §1512(c)(1) in the final Act may have\nreflected belt-and-suspenders caution: If §1519 contained\nsome flaw, §1512(c)(1) would serve as a backstop. Or the\naddition of §1512(c)(1) may have derived solely from legis-\nlators’ wish “to satisfy audiences other than courts”—that\nis, the President and his Justice Department. Gluck &\nBressman, Statutory Interpretation from the Inside, 65\nStan. L. Rev. 901, 935 (2013) (emphasis deleted). Which-\never the case, Congress’s consciousness of overlap between\nthe two provisions removes any conceivable reason to cast\naside §1519’s ordinary meaning in service of preventing\nsome statutory repetition.\n   Indeed, the inclusion of §1512(c)(1) in Sarbanes-Oxley\ncreates a far worse problem for the plurality’s construction\nof §1519 than for mine. Section 1512(c)(1) criminalizes the\ndestruction of any “record, document, or other object”;\n§1519 of any “record, document, or tangible object.” On\nthe plurality’s view, one “object” is really an object, where-\n12                    YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nas the other is only an object that preserves or stores\ninformation. But “[t]he normal rule of statutory construc-\ntion assumes that identical words used in different parts\nof the same act,” passed at the same time, “are intended to\nhave the same meaning.” Sorenson v. Secretary of Treas-\nury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And that is especially true when the different\nprovisions pertain to the same subject. See supra, at 5–6.\nThe plurality doesn’t—really, can’t—explain why it in-\nstead interprets the same words used in two provisions of\nthe same Act addressing the same basic problem to mean\nfundamentally different things.\n   Getting nowhere with surplusage, the plurality switches\ncanons, hoping that noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\nwill save it. See ante, at 13–16; see also ante, at 1–2 (opin-\nion of ALITO, J.). The first of those related canons advises\nthat words grouped in a list be given similar meanings.\nThe second counsels that a general term following specific\nwords embraces only things of a similar kind. According\nto the plurality, those Latin maxims change the English\nmeaning of “tangible object” to only things, like records\nand documents, “used to record or preserve information.”\nAnte, at 14.5 But understood as this Court always has, the\ncanons have no such transformative effect on the worka-\n——————\n  5 The plurality seeks support for this argument in the Sentencing\n\nCommission’s construction of the phrase “records, documents, or\ntangible objects,” ante, at 14, but to no avail. The plurality cites a note\nin the Commission’s Manual clarifying that this phrase, as used in the\nSentencing Guidelines, “includes” various electronic information,\ncommunications, and storage devices.           United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual §2J1.2, comment., n. 1 (Nov. 2014)\n(USSG). But “includes” (following its ordinary definition) “is not\nexhaustive,” as the Commission’s commentary makes explicit. USSG\n§1B1.1, comment., n. 2. Otherwise, the Commission’s construction\nwouldn’t encompass paper documents. All the note does is to make\nplain that “records, documents, or tangible objects” embraces stuff\nrelating to the digital (as well as the material) world.\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)            13\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nday language Congress chose.\n   As an initial matter, this Court uses noscitur a sociis\nand ejusdem generis to resolve ambiguity, not create it.\nThose principles are “useful rule[s] of construction where\nwords are of obscure or doubtful meaning.” Russell Motor\nCar Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514, 520 (1923). But\nwhen words have a clear definition, and all other contex-\ntual clues support that meaning, the canons cannot\nproperly defeat Congress’s decision to draft broad legisla-\ntion. See, e.g., Ali, 552 U. S., at 227 (rejecting the invoca-\ntion of these canons as an “attempt to create ambiguity\nwhere the statute’s text and structure suggest none”).\n   Anyway, assigning “tangible object” its ordinary mean-\ning comports with noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis\nwhen applied, as they should be, with attention to §1519’s\nsubject and purpose. Those canons require identifying a\ncommon trait that links all the words in a statutory\nphrase. See, e.g., Graham County Soil and Water Conser-\nvation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. 280,\n289, n. 7 (2010); Ali, 552 U. S., at 224–226. In responding\nto that demand, the plurality characterizes records and\ndocuments as things that preserve information—and so\nthey are. But just as much, they are things that provide\ninformation, and thus potentially serve as evidence rele-\nvant to matters under review. And in a statute pertaining\nto obstruction of federal investigations, that evidentiary\nfunction comes to the fore. The destruction of records and\ndocuments prevents law enforcement agents from gather-\ning facts relevant to official inquiries. And so too does the\ndestruction of tangible objects—of whatever kind. Whether\nthe item is a fisherman’s ledger or an undersized fish,\nthrowing it overboard has the identical effect on the ad-\nministration of justice. See supra, at 7. For purposes of\n§1519, records, documents, and (all) tangible objects are\ntherefore alike.\n   Indeed, even the plurality can’t fully credit its nosci-\n14                YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ntur/ejusdem argument. The same reasoning would apply\nto every law placing the word “object” (or “thing”) after\n“record” and “document.” But as noted earlier, such stat-\nutes are common: The phrase appears (among other places)\nin many state laws based on the Model Penal Code, as\nwell as in multiple provisions of §1512. See supra, at 4–5.\nThe plurality accepts that in those laws “object” means\nobject; its argument about superfluity positively depends\non giving §1512(c)(1) that broader reading. See ante, at\n13, 16. What, then, is the difference here? The plurality\nproposes that some of those statutes describe less serious\noffenses than §1519. See ante, at 17. How and why that\ndistinction affects application of the noscitur a sociis and\nejusdem generis canons is left obscure: Count it as\none more of the plurality’s never-before-propounded,\nnot-readily-explained interpretive theories. See supra, at 7,\n8–9, 11–12. But in any event, that rationale cannot sup-\nport the plurality’s willingness to give “object” its natural\nmeaning in §1512, which (like §1519) sets out felonies\nwith penalties of up to 20 years. See §§1512(a)(3)(C), (b),\n(c). The canons, in the plurality’s interpretive world,\napparently switch on and off whenever convenient.\n   And the plurality’s invocation of §1519’s verbs does\nnothing to buttress its canon-based argument. See ante,\nat 14–15; ante, at 2–3 (opinion of ALITO, J.). The plurality\nobserves that §1519 prohibits “falsif[ying]” or “mak[ing] a\nfalse entry in” a tangible object, and no one can do those\nthings to, say, a murder weapon (or a fish). Ante, at 14.\nBut of course someone can alter, destroy, mutilate, con-\nceal, or cover up such a tangible object, and §1519 prohibits\nthose actions too. The Court has never before suggested\nthat all the verbs in a statute need to match up with all\nthe nouns. See Robers v. United States, 572 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 4) (“[T]he law does not require legisla-\ntors to write extra language specifically exempting, phrase\nby phrase, applications in respect to which a portion of a\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

It is exactly\nwhen Congress sets out to draft a statute broadly—to\ninclude every imaginable variation on a theme—that such\nmismatches will arise. To respond by narrowing the law,\nas the plurality does, is thus to flout both what Congress\nwrote and what Congress wanted.\n   Finally, when all else fails, the plurality invokes the\nrule of lenity. See ante, at 18. But even in its most robust\nform, that rule only kicks in when, “after all legitimate\ntools of interpretation have been exhausted, ‘a reasonable\ndoubt persists’ regarding whether Congress has made the\ndefendant’s conduct a federal crime.” Abramski v. United\nStates, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 12) (quoting Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990)). No such doubt lingers here. The plural-\nity points to the breadth of §1519, see ante, at 18, as\nthough breadth were equivalent to ambiguity. It is not.\nSection 1519 is very broad. It is also very clear. Every\ntraditional tool of statutory interpretation points in the\nsame direction, toward “object” meaning object. Lenity\noffers no proper refuge from that straightforward (even\nthough capacious) construction.6\n\n\n\n——————\n  6 As part of its lenity argument, the plurality asserts that Yates did\n\nnot have “fair warning” that his conduct amounted to a felony. Ante, at\n18; see ante, at 17 (stating that “Yates would have had scant reason to\nanticipate a felony prosecution” when throwing fish overboard). But\neven under the plurality’s view, the dumping of fish is potentially a\nfederal felony—just under §1512(c)(1), rather than §1519. See ante, at\n12–13. In any event, the plurality itself acknowledges that the ordi-\nnary meaning of §1519 covers Yates’s conduct, see ante, at 7: That\nprovision, no less than §1512(c)(1), announces its broad scope in the\nclearest possible terms. And when an ordinary citizen seeks notice of a\nstatute’s scope, he is more likely to focus on the plain text than (as the\nplurality would have it) on the section number, the superfluity princi-\nple, and the noscitur and ejusdem canons.\n16                YATES v.

It relies primarily on the noscitur a sociis\nand ejusdem generis canons, tries to bolster them with\n§1519’s “list of verbs,” and concludes with the section’s\ntitle. See supra, at 7–8, 12–13, 14–15 (addressing each of\nthose arguments). (Notably, even the concurrence puts no\nstock in the plurality’s section-number and superfluity\nclaims.) From those familiar materials, the concurrence\narrives at the following definition: “ ‘tangible object’ should\nmean something similar to records or documents.” Ante,\nat 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). In amplifying that purported\nguidance, the concurrence suggests applying the term\n“tangible object” in keeping with what “a neighbor, when\nasked to identify something similar to record or docu-\nment,” might answer. Ante, at 1. “[W]ho wouldn’t raise an\neyebrow,” the concurrence wonders, if the neighbor said\n“crocodile”? Ante, at 1–2. Courts sometimes say, when\nexplaining the Latin maxims, that the “words of a statute\nshould be interpreted consistent with their neighbors.”\nSee, e.g., United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 105 (2000).\nThe concurrence takes that expression literally.\n   But §1519’s meaning should not hinge on the odd game\nof Mad Libs the concurrence proposes. No one reading\n§1519 needs to fill in a blank after the words “records” and\n“documents.” That is because Congress, quite helpfully,\nalready did so—adding the term “tangible object.” The\nissue in this case is what that term means. So if the con-\ncurrence wishes to ask its neighbor a question, I’d recom-\nmend a more pertinent one: Do you think a fish (or, if the\nconcurrence prefers, a crocodile) is a “tangible object”? As\nto that query, “who wouldn’t raise an eyebrow” if the\nneighbor said “no”?\n   In insisting on its different question, the concurrence\nneglects the proper function of catchall phrases like “or\ntangible object.” The reason Congress uses such terms is\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

S., at 860.\nCongress realizes that in a game of free association with\n“record” and “document,” it will never think of all the\nother things—including crocodiles and fish—whose de-\nstruction or alteration can (less frequently but just as\neffectively) thwart law enforcement. Cf. United States v.\nStubbs, 11 F. 3d 632, 637–638 (CA6 1993) (dead crocodiles\nused as evidence to support smuggling conviction). And so\nCongress adds the general term “or tangible object”—\nagain, exactly because such things “do[ ] not spring to\nmind.”7\n   The concurrence suggests that the term “tangible object”\nserves not as a catchall for physical evidence but to “en-\nsure beyond question” that e-mails and other electronic\nfiles fall within §1519’s compass. Ante, at 2. But that\nclaim is eyebrow-raising in its own right. Would a Con-\ngress wishing to make certain that §1519 applies to\ne-mails add the phrase “tangible object” (as opposed, say, to\n“electronic communications”)? Would a judge or jury\nmember predictably find that “tangible object” encom-\npasses something as virtual as e-mail (as compared, say,\n\n——————\n  7 The concurrence contends that when the noscitur and ejusdem can-\n\nons are in play, “ ‘known unknowns’ should be similar to known\nknowns, i.e., here, records and documents.” Ante, at 2. But as noted\nabove, records and documents are similar to crocodiles and fish as far\nas §1519 is concerned: All are potentially useful as evidence in an\ninvestigation. See supra, at 13. The concurrence never explains why\nthat similarity isn’t the relevant one in a statute aimed at evidence-\ntampering.\n18               YATES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nwith something as real as a fish)? If not (and the answer\nis not), then that term cannot function as a failsafe for\ne-mails.\n  The concurrence acknowledges that no one of its argu-\nments can carry the day; rather, it takes the Latin canons\nplus §1519’s verbs plus §1519’s title to “tip the case” for\nYates. Ante, at 1. But the sum total of three mistaken\narguments is . . . three mistaken arguments. They do not\nget better in the combining. And so the concurrence ends\nup right where the plurality does, except that the concur-\nrence, eschewing the rule of lenity, has nothing to fall\nback on.\n                              III\n   If none of the traditional tools of statutory interpreta-\ntion can produce today’s result, then what accounts for it?\nThe plurality offers a clue when it emphasizes the dispro-\nportionate penalties §1519 imposes if the law is read\nbroadly. See ante, at 17–18. Section 1519, the plurality\nobjects, would then “expose[ ] individuals to 20-year prison\nsentences for tampering with any physical object that\nmight have evidentiary value in any federal investigation\ninto any offense.” Ante, at 18. That brings to the surface\nthe real issue: overcriminalization and excessive punish-\nment in the U. S. Code.\n   Now as to this statute, I think the plurality somewhat—\nthough only somewhat—exaggerates the matter. The\nplurality omits from its description of §1519 the require-\nment that a person act “knowingly” and with “the intent to\nimpede, obstruct, or influence” federal law enforcement.\nAnd in highlighting §1519’s maximum penalty, the plural-\nity glosses over the absence of any prescribed minimum.\n(Let’s not forget that Yates’s sentence was not 20 years,\nbut 30 days.) Congress presumably enacts laws with high\nmaximums and no minimums when it thinks the prohibited\nconduct may run the gamut from major to minor. That\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ___ (2015)           19\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nis assuredly true of acts obstructing justice. Compare this\ncase with the following, all of which properly come within,\nbut now fall outside, §1519: McRae, 702 F. 3d, at 834–838\n(burning human body to thwart murder investigation);\nMaury, 695 F. 3d, at 243–244 (altering cement mixer to\nimpede inquiry into amputation of employee’s fingers);\nUnited States v. Natal, 2014 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 108852,\n*24–*26 (D Conn., Aug. 7, 2014) (repainting van to cover\nup evidence of fatal arson). Most district judges, as Con-\ngress knows, will recognize differences between such cases\nand prosecutions like this one, and will try to make the\npunishment fit the crime. Still and all, I tend to think, for\nthe reasons the plurality gives, that §1519 is a bad law—\ntoo broad and undifferentiated, with too-high maximum\npenalties, which give prosecutors too much leverage and\nsentencers too much discretion. And I’d go further: In\nthose ways, §1519 is unfortunately not an outlier, but an\nemblem of a deeper pathology in the federal criminal code.\n   But whatever the wisdom or folly of §1519, this Court\ndoes not get to rewrite the law. “Resolution of the pros\nand cons of whether a statute should sweep broadly or\nnarrowly is for Congress.” Rodgers, 466 U. S., at 484. If\njudges disagree with Congress’s choice, we are perfectly\nentitled to say so—in lectures, in law review articles, and\neven in dicta. But we are not entitled to replace the stat-\nute Congress enacted with an alternative of our own\ndesign.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2781925/", "sha1": "9a2005afc13b4771e6cb602c81ab959f3326218e", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-02-25T08:01:06.071460"}
