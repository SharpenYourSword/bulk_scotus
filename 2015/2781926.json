FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 13–534.      Argued October 14, 2014—Decided February 25, 2015\nNorth Carolina’s Dental Practice Act (Act) provides that the North Car-\n olina State Board of Dental Examiners (Board) is “the agency of the\n State for the regulation of the practice of dentistry.” The Board’s\n principal duty is to create, administer, and enforce a licensing system\n for dentists; and six of its eight members must be licensed, practicing\n dentists.\n    The Act does not specify that teeth whitening is “the practice of\n dentistry.” Nonetheless, after dentists complained to the Board that\n nondentists were charging lower prices for such services than den-\n tists did, the Board issued at least 47 official cease-and-desist letters\n to nondentist teeth whitening service providers and product manu-\n facturers, often warning that the unlicensed practice of dentistry is a\n crime. This and other related Board actions led nondentists to cease\n offering teeth whitening services in North Carolina.\n    The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an administrative com-\n plaint, alleging that the Board’s concerted action to exclude\n nondentists from the market for teeth whitening services in North\n Carolina constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of compe-\n tition under the Federal Trade Commission Act. An Administrative\n Law Judge (ALJ) denied the Board’s motion to dismiss on the ground\n of state-action immunity. The FTC sustained that ruling, reasoning\n that even if the Board had acted pursuant to a clearly articulated\n state policy to displace competition, the Board must be actively su-\n pervised by the State to claim immunity, which it was not. After a\n hearing on the merits, the ALJ determined that the Board had un-\n reasonably restrained trade in violation of antitrust law. The FTC\n again sustained the ALJ, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed the FTC in\n2              NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                        EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                            Syllabus\n\n\n    all respects.\nHeld: Because a controlling number of the Board’s decisionmakers are\n active market participants in the occupation the Board regulates, the\n Board can invoke state-action antitrust immunity only if it was sub-\n ject to active supervision by the State, and here that requirement is\n not met. Pp. 5–18.\n     (a) Federal antitrust law is a central safeguard for the Nation’s free\n market structures. However, requiring States to conform to the\n mandates of the Sherman Act at the expense of other values a State\n may deem fundamental would impose an impermissible burden on\n the States’ power to regulate. Therefore, beginning with Parker v.\n Brown, 317 U. S. 341, this Court interpreted the antitrust laws to\n confer immunity on the anticompetitive conduct of States acting in\n their sovereign capacity. Pp. 5–6.\n     (b) The Board’s actions are not cloaked with Parker immunity. A\n nonsovereign actor controlled by active market participants—such as\n the Board—enjoys Parker immunity only if “ ‘the challenged restraint\n . . . [is] clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state poli-\n cy,’ and . . . ‘the policy . . . [is] actively supervised by the State.’ ”\n FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc., 568 U. S. ___, ___ (quoting\n California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445\n U. S. 97, 105). Here, the Board did not receive active supervision of\n its anticompetitive conduct. Pp. 6–17.\n        (1) An entity may not invoke Parker immunity unless its actions\n are an exercise of the State’s sovereign power. See Columbia v. Omni\n Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U. S. 365, 374. Thus, where a State\n delegates control over a market to a nonsovereign actor the Sherman\n Act confers immunity only if the State accepts political accountability\n for the anticompetitive conduct it permits and controls. Limits on\n state-action immunity are most essential when a State seeks to dele-\n gate its regulatory power to active market participants, for dual alle-\n giances are not always apparent to an actor and prohibitions against\n anticompetitive self-regulation by active market participants are an\n axiom of federal antitrust policy. Accordingly, Parker immunity re-\n quires that the anticompetitive conduct of nonsovereign actors, espe-\n cially those authorized by the State to regulate their own profession,\n result from procedures that suffice to make it the State’s own.\n Midcal’s two-part test provides a proper analytical framework to re-\n solve the ultimate question whether an anticompetitive policy is in-\n deed the policy of a State. The first requirement—clear articula-\n tion—rarely will achieve that goal by itself, for entities purporting to\n act under state authority might diverge from the State’s considered\n definition of the public good and engage in private self-dealing. The\n second Midcal requirement—active supervision—seeks to avoid this\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nharm by requiring the State to review and approve interstitial poli-\ncies made by the entity claiming immunity. Pp. 6–10.\n     (2) There are instances in which an actor can be excused from\nMidcal’s active supervision requirement. Municipalities, which are\nelectorally accountable, have general regulatory powers, and have no\nprivate price-fixing agenda, are subject exclusively to the clear articu-\nlation requirement. See Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34, 35. That\nHallie excused municipalities from Midcal’s supervision rule for\nthese reasons, however, all but confirms the rule’s applicability to ac-\ntors controlled by active market participants. Further, in light of\nOmni’s holding that an otherwise immune entity will not lose im-\nmunity based on ad hoc and ex post questioning of its motives for\nmaking particular decisions, 499 U. S., at 374, it is all the more nec-\nessary to ensure the conditions for granting immunity are met in the\nfirst place, see FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U. S. 621, 633, and\nPhoebe Putney, supra, at ___. The clear lesson of precedent is that\nMidcal’s active supervision test is an essential prerequisite of Parker\nimmunity for any nonsovereign entity—public or private—controlled\nby active market participants. Pp. 10–12.\n     (3) The Board’s argument that entities designated by the States\nas agencies are exempt from Midcal’s second requirement cannot be\nreconciled with the Court’s repeated conclusion that the need for su-\npervision turns not on the formal designation given by States to regu-\nlators but on the risk that active market participants will pursue pri-\nvate interests in restraining trade. State agencies controlled by\nactive market participants pose the very risk of self-dealing Midcal’s\nsupervision requirement was created to address. See Goldfarb v.\nVirginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 791. This conclusion does not\nquestion the good faith of state officers but rather is an assessment of\nthe structural risk of market participants’ confusing their own inter-\nests with the State’s policy goals. While Hallie stated “it is likely\nthat active state supervision would also not be required” for agencies,\n471 U. S., at 46, n. 10, the entity there was more like prototypical\nstate agencies, not specialized boards dominated by active market\nparticipants. The latter are similar to private trade associations\nvested by States with regulatory authority, which must satisfy\nMidcal’s active supervision standard. 445 U. S., at 105–106. The\nsimilarities between agencies controlled by active market partici-\npants and such associations are not eliminated simply because the\nformer are given a formal designation by the State, vested with a\nmeasure of government power, and required to follow some procedur-\nal rules. See Hallie, supra, at 39. When a State empowers a group of\nactive market participants to decide who can participate in its mar-\nket, and on what terms, the need for supervision is manifest. Thus,\n4             NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                       EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                           Syllabus\n\n\n    the Court holds today that a state board on which a controlling num-\n    ber of decisionmakers are active market participants in the occupa-\n    tion the board regulates must satisfy Midcal’s active supervision re-\n    quirement in order to invoke state-action antitrust immunity.\n    Pp. 12–14.\n          (4) The State argues that allowing this FTC order to stand will\n    discourage dedicated citizens from serving on state agencies that\n    regulate their own occupation. But this holding is not inconsistent\n    with the idea that those who pursue a calling must embrace ethical\n    standards that derive from a duty separate from the dictates of the\n    State. Further, this case does not offer occasion to address the ques-\n    tion whether agency officials, including board members, may, under\n    some circumstances, enjoy immunity from damages liability. Of\n    course, States may provide for the defense and indemnification of\n    agency members in the event of litigation, and they can also ensure\n    Parker immunity is available by adopting clear policies to displace\n    competition and providing active supervision. Arguments against the\n    wisdom of applying the antitrust laws to professional regulation ab-\n    sent compliance with the prerequisites for invoking Parker immunity\n    must be rejected, see Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94, 105–106, partic-\n    ularly in light of the risks licensing boards dominated by market par-\n    ticipants may pose to the free market. Pp. 14–16.\n          (5) The Board does not contend in this Court that its anticompet-\n    itive conduct was actively supervised by the State or that it should\n    receive Parker immunity on that basis. The Act delegates control\n    over the practice of dentistry to the Board, but says nothing about\n    teeth whitening. In acting to expel the dentists’ competitors from the\n    market, the Board relied on cease-and-desist letters threatening\n    criminal liability, instead of other powers at its disposal that would\n    have invoked oversight by a politically accountable official. Whether\n    or not the Board exceeded its powers under North Carolina law, there\n    is no evidence of any decision by the State to initiate or concur with\n    the Board’s actions against the nondentists. P. 17.\n       (c) Here, where there are no specific supervisory systems to be re-\n    viewed, it suffices to note that the inquiry regarding active supervi-\n    sion is flexible and context-dependent. The question is whether the\n    State’s review mechanisms provide “realistic assurance” that a non-\n    sovereign actor’s anticompetitive conduct “promotes state policy, ra-\n    ther than merely the party’s individual interests.” Patrick, 486 U. S.,\n    100–101. The Court has identified only a few constant requirements\n    of active supervision: The supervisor must review the substance of\n    the anticompetitive decision, see id., at 102–103; the supervisor must\n    have the power to veto or modify particular decisions to ensure they\n    accord with state policy, see ibid.; and the “mere potential for state\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

Further, the state supervisor may not itself be\n  an active market participant.

A majority of the\nboard’s members are engaged in the active practice of\nthe profession it regulates. The question is whether the\nboard’s actions are protected from Sherman Act regulation\nunder the doctrine of state-action antitrust immunity, as\ndefined and applied in this Court’s decisions beginning\nwith Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943).\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  In its Dental Practice Act (Act), North Carolina has\ndeclared the practice of dentistry to be a matter of public\nconcern requiring regulation. N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §90–\n22(a) (2013). Under the Act, the North Carolina State\nBoard of Dental Examiners (Board) is “the agency of the\nState for the regulation of the practice of dentistry.” §90–\n22(b).\n  The Board’s principal duty is to create, administer, and\nenforce a licensing system for dentists. See §§90–29 to\n2         NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n90–41. To perform that function it has broad authority\nover licensees. See §90–41. The Board’s authority with\nrespect to unlicensed persons, however, is more restricted:\nlike “any resident citizen,” the Board may file suit to\n“perpetually enjoin any person from . . . unlawfully prac­\nticing dentistry.” §90–40.1.\n   The Act provides that six of the Board’s eight members\nmust be licensed dentists engaged in the active practice of\ndentistry. §90–22. They are elected by other licensed\ndentists in North Carolina, who cast their ballots in elec­\ntions conducted by the Board. Ibid. The seventh member\nmust be a licensed and practicing dental hygienist, and he\nor she is elected by other licensed hygienists. Ibid. The\nfinal member is referred to by the Act as a “consumer” and\nis appointed by the Governor. Ibid. All members serve\n3-year terms, and no person may serve more than two con­\nsecutive terms. Ibid. The Act does not create any mecha­\nnism for the removal of an elected member of the Board by\na public official. See ibid.\n   Board members swear an oath of office, §138A–22(a),\nand the Board must comply with the State’s Administra­\ntive Procedure Act, §150B–1 et seq., Public Records Act,\n§132–1 et seq., and open-meetings law, §143–318.9 et seq.\nThe Board may promulgate rules and regulations govern­\ning the practice of dentistry within the State, provided\nthose mandates are not inconsistent with the Act and are\napproved by the North Carolina Rules Review Commis­\nsion, whose members are appointed by the state legisla­\nture. See §§90–48, 143B–30.1, 150B–21.9(a).\n                              B\n  In the 1990’s, dentists in North Carolina started whiten­\ning teeth. Many of those who did so, including 8 of the\nBoard’s 10 members during the period at issue in this\ncase, earned substantial fees for that service. By 2003,\nnondentists arrived on the scene. They charged lower\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprices for their services than the dentists did. Dentists\nsoon began to complain to the Board about their new\ncompetitors. Few complaints warned of possible harm to\nconsumers. Most expressed a principal concern with the\nlow prices charged by nondentists.\n   Responding to these filings, the Board opened an inves­\ntigation into nondentist teeth whitening. A dentist mem­\nber was placed in charge of the inquiry. Neither the\nBoard’s hygienist member nor its consumer member par­\nticipated in this undertaking. The Board’s chief opera­\ntions officer remarked that the Board was “going forth to\ndo battle” with nondentists. App. to Pet. for Cert. 103a.\nThe Board’s concern did not result in a formal rule or\nregulation reviewable by the independent Rules Review\nCommission, even though the Act does not, by its terms,\nspecify that teeth whitening is “the practice of dentistry.”\n   Starting in 2006, the Board issued at least 47 cease-and­\ndesist letters on its official letterhead to nondentist teeth\nwhitening service providers and product manufacturers.\nMany of those letters directed the recipient to cease “all\nactivity constituting the practice of dentistry”; warned\nthat the unlicensed practice of dentistry is a crime; and\nstrongly implied (or expressly stated) that teeth whitening\nconstitutes “the practice of dentistry.” App. 13, 15. In\nearly 2007, the Board persuaded the North Carolina\nBoard of Cosmetic Art Examiners to warn cosmetologists\nagainst providing teeth whitening services. Later that\nyear, the Board sent letters to mall operators, stating that\nkiosk teeth whiteners were violating the Dental Practice\nAct and advising that the malls consider expelling viola­\ntors from their premises.\n   These actions had the intended result. Nondentists\nceased offering teeth whitening services in North Carolina.\n                           C\n  In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an\n4         NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nadministrative complaint charging the Board with violat­\ning §5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 719,\nas amended, 15 U. S. C. §45. The FTC alleged that the\nBoard’s concerted action to exclude nondentists from the\nmarket for teeth whitening services in North Carolina\nconstituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of com­\npetition. The Board moved to dismiss, alleging state-\naction immunity. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)\ndenied the motion. On appeal, the FTC sustained the\nALJ’s ruling. It reasoned that, even assuming the Board\nhad acted pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy to\ndisplace competition, the Board is a “public/private hy­\nbrid” that must be actively supervised by the State to\nclaim immunity. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. The FTC\nfurther concluded the Board could not make that showing.\n   Following other proceedings not relevant here, the ALJ\nconducted a hearing on the merits and determined the\nBoard had unreasonably restrained trade in violation of\nantitrust law. On appeal, the FTC again sustained the\nALJ. The FTC rejected the Board’s public safety justifica­\ntion, noting, inter alia, “a wealth of evidence . . . suggest­\ning that non-dentist provided teeth whitening is a safe\ncosmetic procedure.” Id., at 123a.\n   The FTC ordered the Board to stop sending the cease­\nand-desist letters or other communications that stated\nnondentists may not offer teeth whitening services and\nproducts. It further ordered the Board to issue notices to\nall earlier recipients of the Board’s cease-and-desist orders\nadvising them of the Board’s proper sphere of authority\nand saying, among other options, that the notice recipients\nhad a right to seek declaratory rulings in state court.\n   On petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit affirmed the FTC in all respects. 717 F. 3d\n359, 370 (2013). This Court granted certiorari. 571 U. S.\n___ (2014).\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             II\n\n  Federal antitrust law is a central safeguard for the\nNation’s free market structures. In this regard it is “as\nimportant to the preservation of economic freedom and our\nfree-enterprise system as the Bill of Rights is to the pro­\ntection of our fundamental personal freedoms.” United\nStates v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U. S. 596, 610 (1972).\nThe antitrust laws declare a considered and decisive pro­\nhibition by the Federal Government of cartels, price fixing,\nand other combinations or practices that undermine the\nfree market.\n  The Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C.\n§1 et seq., serves to promote robust competition, which in\nturn empowers the States and provides their citizens with\nopportunities to pursue their own and the public’s welfare.\nSee FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U. S. 621, 632 (1992).\nThe States, however, when acting in their respective\nrealm, need not adhere in all contexts to a model of unfet­\ntered competition. While “the States regulate their econ­\nomies in many ways not inconsistent with the antitrust\nlaws,” id., at 635–636, in some spheres they impose re­\nstrictions on occupations, confer exclusive or shared rights\nto dominate a market, or otherwise limit competition to\nachieve public objectives. If every duly enacted state law\nor policy were required to conform to the mandates of the\nSherman Act, thus promoting competition at the expense\nof other values a State may deem fundamental, federal\nantitrust law would impose an impermissible burden on\nthe States’ power to regulate. See Exxon Corp. v. Gover-\nnor of Maryland, 437 U. S. 117, 133 (1978); see also\nEasterbrook, Antitrust and the Economics of Federalism,\n26 J. Law & Econ. 23, 24 (1983).\n  For these reasons, the Court in Parker v. Brown inter­\npreted the antitrust laws to confer immunity on anticom­\npetitive conduct by the States when acting in their sover­\neign capacity. See 317 U. S., at 350–351. That ruling\n6          NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                    EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nrecognized Congress’ purpose to respect the federal bal­\nance and to “embody in the Sherman Act the federalism\nprinciple that the States possess a significant measure of\nsovereignty under our Constitution.” Community Com-\nmunications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U. S. 40, 53 (1982). Since\n1943, the Court has reaffirmed the importance of Parker’s\ncentral holding. See, e.g., Ticor, supra, at 632–637; Hoover\nv. Ronwin, 466 U. S. 558, 568 (1984); Lafayette v. Louisi-\nana Power & Light Co., 435 U. S. 389, 394–400 (1978).\n                             III\n   In this case the Board argues its members were invested\nby North Carolina with the power of the State and that, as\na result, the Board’s actions are cloaked with Parker\nimmunity. This argument fails, however. A nonsovereign\nactor controlled by active market participants—such as\nthe Board—enjoys Parker immunity only if it satisfies two\nrequirements: “first that ‘the challenged restraint . . . be\none clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as\nstate policy,’ and second that ‘the policy . . . be actively\nsupervised by the State.’ ” FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health\nSystem, Inc., 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 7) (quot­\ning California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Alu-\nminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97, 105 (1980)). The parties have\nassumed that the clear articulation requirement is satis­\nfied, and we do the same. While North Carolina prohibits\nthe unauthorized practice of dentistry, however, its Act is\nsilent on whether that broad prohibition covers teeth\nwhitening. Here, the Board did not receive active super­\nvision by the State when it interpreted the Act as ad­\ndressing teeth whitening and when it enforced that policy\nby issuing cease-and-desist letters to nondentist teeth\nwhiteners.\n                             A\n    Although state-action immunity exists to avoid conflicts\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween state sovereignty and the Nation’s commitment to\na policy of robust competition, Parker immunity is not\nunbounded. “[G]iven the fundamental national values of\nfree enterprise and economic competition that are embod­\nied in the federal antitrust laws, ‘state action immunity is\ndisfavored, much as are repeals by implication.’ ” Phoebe\nPutney, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quoting Ticor, supra,\nat 636).\n  An entity may not invoke Parker immunity unless the\nactions in question are an exercise of the State’s sovereign\npower. See Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc.,\n499 U. S. 365, 374 (1991). State legislation and “deci­\nsion[s] of a state supreme court, acting legislatively rather\nthan judicially,” will satisfy this standard, and “ipso facto\nare exempt from the operation of the antitrust laws” be­\ncause they are an undoubted exercise of state sovereign\nauthority. Hoover, supra, at 567–568.\n  But while the Sherman Act confers immunity on the\nStates’ own anticompetitive policies out of respect for\nfederalism, it does not always confer immunity where, as\nhere, a State delegates control over a market to a non-\nsovereign actor. See Parker, supra, at 351 (“[A] state does\nnot give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act\nby authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their\naction is lawful”). For purposes of Parker, a nonsovereign\nactor is one whose conduct does not automatically qualify\nas that of the sovereign State itself. See Hoover, supra, at\n567–568. State agencies are not simply by their govern­\nmental character sovereign actors for purposes of state-\naction immunity. See Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421\nU. S. 773, 791 (1975) (“The fact that the State Bar is a\nstate agency for some limited purposes does not create an\nantitrust shield that allows it to foster anticompetitive\npractices for the benefit of its members”). Immunity for\nstate agencies, therefore, requires more than a mere fa­\ncade of state involvement, for it is necessary in light of\n8         NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nParker’s rationale to ensure the States accept political\naccountability for anticompetitive conduct they permit and\ncontrol. See Ticor, 504 U. S., at 636.\n   Limits on state-action immunity are most essential\nwhen the State seeks to delegate its regulatory power to\nactive market participants, for established ethical stand­\nards may blend with private anticompetitive motives in a\nway difficult even for market participants to discern. Dual\nallegiances are not always apparent to an actor. In conse­\nquence, active market participants cannot be allowed to\nregulate their own markets free from antitrust account­\nability. See Midcal, supra, at 106 (“The national policy in\nfavor of competition cannot be thwarted by casting [a]\ngauzy cloak of state involvement over what is essentially a\nprivate price-fixing arrangement”). Indeed, prohibitions\nagainst anticompetitive self-regulation by active market\nparticipants are an axiom of federal antitrust policy. See,\ne.g., Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486\nU. S. 492, 501 (1988); Hoover, supra, at 584 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting) (“The risk that private regulation of market\nentry, prices, or output may be designed to confer monop­\noly profits on members of an industry at the expense of the\nconsuming public has been the central concern of . . . our\nantitrust jurisprudence”); see also Elhauge, The Scope of\nAntitrust Process, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 667, 672 (1991). So it\nfollows that, under Parker and the Supremacy Clause, the\nStates’ greater power to attain an end does not include the\nlesser power to negate the congressional judgment embod­\nied in the Sherman Act through unsupervised delegations\nto active market participants. See Garland, Antitrust and\nState Action: Economic Efficiency and the Political Pro­\ncess, 96 Yale L. J. 486, 500 (1986).\n   Parker immunity requires that the anticompetitive\nconduct of nonsovereign actors, especially those author­\nized by the State to regulate their own profession, result\nfrom procedures that suffice to make it the State’s own.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Goldfarb, supra, at 790; see also 1A P. Areeda & H.\nHovencamp, Antitrust Law ¶226, p. 180 (4th ed. 2013)\n(Areeda & Hovencamp). The question is not whether the\nchallenged conduct is efficient, well-functioning, or wise.\nSee Ticor, supra, at 634–635. Rather, it is “whether anti­\ncompetitive conduct engaged in by [nonsovereign actors]\nshould be deemed state action and thus shielded from the\nantitrust laws.” Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94, 100\n(1988).\n   To answer this question, the Court applies the two-part\ntest set forth in California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v.\nMidcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97, a case arising from\nCalifornia’s delegation of price-fixing authority to wine\nmerchants. Under Midcal, “[a] state law or regulatory\nscheme cannot be the basis for antitrust immunity unless,\nfirst, the State has articulated a clear policy to allow the\nanticompetitive conduct, and second, the State provides\nactive supervision of [the] anticompetitive conduct.” Ticor,\nsupra, at 631 (citing Midcal, supra, at 105).\n   Midcal’s clear articulation requirement is satisfied\n“where the displacement of competition [is] the inherent,\nlogical, or ordinary result of the exercise of authority\ndelegated by the state legislature. In that scenario, the\nState must have foreseen and implicitly endorsed the\nanticompetitive effects as consistent with its policy goals.”\nPhoebe Putney, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). The\nactive supervision requirement demands, inter alia, “that\nstate officials have and exercise power to review particular\nanticompetitive acts of private parties and disapprove\nthose that fail to accord with state policy.” Patrick, supra,\nU. S., at 101.\n   The two requirements set forth in Midcal provide a\nproper analytical framework to resolve the ultimate ques­\ntion whether an anticompetitive policy is indeed the policy\nof a State. The first requirement—clear articulation—\nrarely will achieve that goal by itself, for a policy may\n10        NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nsatisfy this test yet still be defined at so high a level of\ngenerality as to leave open critical questions about how\nand to what extent the market should be regulated. See\nTicor, supra, at 636–637. Entities purporting to act under\nstate authority might diverge from the State’s considered\ndefinition of the public good. The resulting asymmetry\nbetween a state policy and its implementation can invite\nprivate self-dealing. The second Midcal requirement—\nactive supervision—seeks to avoid this harm by requiring\nthe State to review and approve interstitial policies made\nby the entity claiming immunity.\n   Midcal’s supervision rule “stems from the recognition\nthat ‘[w]here a private party is engaging in anticompeti­\ntive activity, there is a real danger that he is acting to\nfurther his own interests, rather than the governmental\ninterests of the State.’ ” Patrick, supra, at 100. Concern\nabout the private incentives of active market participants\nanimates Midcal’s supervision mandate, which demands\n“realistic assurance that a private party’s anticompetitive\nconduct promotes state policy, rather than merely the\nparty’s individual interests.” Patrick, supra, at 101.\n                               B\n    In determining whether anticompetitive policies and\nconduct are indeed the action of a State in its sovereign\ncapacity, there are instances in which an actor can be\nexcused from Midcal’s active supervision requirement. In\nHallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34, 45 (1985), the Court\nheld municipalities are subject exclusively to Midcal’s\n“ ‘clear articulation’ ” requirement. That rule, the Court\nobserved, is consistent with the objective of ensuring that\nthe policy at issue be one enacted by the State itself.\nHallie explained that “[w]here the actor is a municipality,\nthere is little or no danger that it is involved in a private\nprice-fixing arrangement. The only real danger is that it\nwill seek to further purely parochial public interests at the\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpense of more overriding state goals.” 471 U. S., at 47.\nHallie further observed that municipalities are electorally\naccountable and lack the kind of private incentives charac­\nteristic of active participants in the market. See id., at 45,\nn. 9. Critically, the municipality in Hallie exercised a\nwide range of governmental powers across different eco­\nnomic spheres, substantially reducing the risk that it\nwould pursue private interests while regulating any single\nfield. See ibid. That Hallie excused municipalities from\nMidcal’s supervision rule for these reasons all but con­\nfirms the rule’s applicability to actors controlled by active\nmarket participants, who ordinarily have none of the\nfeatures justifying the narrow exception Hallie identified.\nSee 471 U. S., at 45.\n   Following Goldfarb, Midcal, and Hallie, which clarified\nthe conditions under which Parker immunity attaches to\nthe conduct of a nonsovereign actor, the Court in Colum-\nbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U. S. 365,\naddressed whether an otherwise immune entity could lose\nimmunity for conspiring with private parties. In Omni, an\naspiring billboard merchant argued that the city of Co­\nlumbia, South Carolina, had violated the Sherman Act—\nand forfeited its Parker immunity—by anticompetitively\nconspiring with an established local company in passing\nan ordinance restricting new billboard construction. 499\nU. S., at 367–368. The Court disagreed, holding there is\nno “conspiracy exception” to Parker. Omni, supra, at 374.\n   Omni, like the cases before it, recognized the importance\nof drawing a line “relevant to the purposes of the Sherman\nAct and of Parker: prohibiting the restriction of competi­\ntion for private gain but permitting the restriction of\ncompetition in the public interest.” 499 U. S., at 378. In\nthe context of a municipal actor which, as in Hallie, exer­\ncised substantial governmental powers, Omni rejected a\nconspiracy exception for “corruption” as vague and un­\nworkable, since “virtually all regulation benefits some\n12        NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsegments of the society and harms others” and may in that\nsense be seen as “ ‘corrupt.’ ” 499 U. S., at 377. Omni also\nrejected subjective tests for corruption that would force a\n“deconstruction of the governmental process and probing\nof the official ‘intent’ that we have consistently sought to\navoid.” Ibid. Thus, whereas the cases preceding it ad­\ndressed the preconditions of Parker immunity and en­\ngaged in an objective, ex ante inquiry into nonsovereign\nactors’ structure and incentives, Omni made clear that\nrecipients of immunity will not lose it on the basis of\nad hoc and ex post questioning of their motives for making\nparticular decisions.\n   Omni’s holding makes it all the more necessary to en­\nsure the conditions for granting immunity are met in the\nfirst place. The Court’s two state-action immunity cases\ndecided after Omni reinforce this point. In Ticor the Court\naffirmed that Midcal’s limits on delegation must ensure\nthat “[a]ctual state involvement, not deference to private\nprice-fixing arrangements under the general auspices of\nstate law, is the precondition for immunity from federal\nlaw.” 504 U. S., at 633. And in Phoebe Putney the Court\nobserved that Midcal’s active supervision requirement, in\nparticular, is an essential condition of state-action immun­\nity when a nonsovereign actor has “an incentive to pursue\n[its] own self-interest under the guise of implementing\nstate policies.” 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quoting\nHallie, supra, at 46–47). The lesson is clear: Midcal’s\nactive supervision test is an essential prerequisite of\nParker immunity for any nonsovereign entity—public or\nprivate—controlled by active market participants.\n                            C\n  The Board argues entities designated by the States as\nagencies are exempt from Midcal’s second requirement.\nThat premise, however, cannot be reconciled with the\nCourt’s repeated conclusion that the need for supervision\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nturns not on the formal designation given by States to\nregulators but on the risk that active market participants\nwill pursue private interests in restraining trade.\n   State agencies controlled by active market participants,\nwho possess singularly strong private interests, pose the\nvery risk of self-dealing Midcal’s supervision requirement\nwas created to address. See Areeda & Hovencamp ¶227,\nat 226. This conclusion does not question the good faith of\nstate officers but rather is an assessment of the structural\nrisk of market participants’ confusing their own interests\nwith the State’s policy goals. See Patrick, 486 U. S., at\n100–101.\n   The Court applied this reasoning to a state agency in\nGoldfarb. There the Court denied immunity to a state\nagency (the Virginia State Bar) controlled by market\nparticipants (lawyers) because the agency had “joined in\nwhat is essentially a private anticompetitive activity” for\n“the benefit of its members.” 421 U. S., at 791, 792. This\nemphasis on the Bar’s private interests explains why\nGoldfarb, though it predates Midcal, considered the lack\nof supervision by the Virginia Supreme Court to be a\nprincipal reason for denying immunity. See 421 U. S., at\n791; see also Hoover, 466 U. S., at 569 (emphasizing lack\nof active supervision in Goldfarb); Bates v. State Bar of\nAriz., 433 U. S. 350, 361–362 (1977) (granting the Arizona\nBar state-action immunity partly because its “rules are\nsubject to pointed re-examination by the policymaker”).\n   While Hallie stated “it is likely that active state super­\nvision would also not be required” for agencies, 471 U. S.,\nat 46, n. 10, the entity there, as was later the case in\nOmni, was an electorally accountable municipality with\ngeneral regulatory powers and no private price-fixing\nagenda. In that and other respects the municipality was\nmore like prototypical state agencies, not specialized\nboards dominated by active market participants. In im­\nportant regards, agencies controlled by market partici­\n14        NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\npants are more similar to private trade associations vested\nby States with regulatory authority than to the agencies\nHallie considered. And as the Court observed three years\nafter Hallie, “[t]here is no doubt that the members of such\nassociations often have economic incentives to restrain\ncompetition and that the product standards set by such\nassociations have a serious potential for anticompetitive\nharm.” Allied Tube, 486 U. S., at 500. For that reason,\nthose associations must satisfy Midcal’s active supervision\nstandard. See Midcal, 445 U. S., at 105–106.\n   The similarities between agencies controlled by active\nmarket participants and private trade associations are not\neliminated simply because the former are given a formal\ndesignation by the State, vested with a measure of gov­\nernment power, and required to follow some procedural\nrules. See Hallie, supra, at 39 (rejecting “purely formalis­\ntic” analysis). Parker immunity does not derive from\nnomenclature alone. When a State empowers a group of\nactive market participants to decide who can participate\nin its market, and on what terms, the need for supervision\nis manifest. See Areeda & Hovencamp ¶227, at 226. The\nCourt holds today that a state board on which a control­\nling number of decisionmakers are active market partici­\npants in the occupation the board regulates must satisfy\nMidcal’s active supervision requirement in order to invoke\nstate-action antitrust immunity.\n                            D\n  The State argues that allowing this FTC order to stand\nwill discourage dedicated citizens from serving on state\nagencies that regulate their own occupation. If this were\nso—and, for reasons to be noted, it need not be so—there\nwould be some cause for concern. The States have a sov­\nereign interest in structuring their governments, see\nGregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991), and may\nconclude there are substantial benefits to staffing their\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

United\nStates, 471 U. S. 48, 64 (1985). There is, moreover, a long\ntradition of citizens esteemed by their professional col­\nleagues devoting time, energy, and talent to enhancing the\ndignity of their calling.\n   Adherence to the idea that those who pursue a calling\nmust embrace ethical standards that derive from a duty\nseparate from the dictates of the State reaches back at\nleast to the Hippocratic Oath. See generally S. Miles, The\nHippocratic Oath and the Ethics of Medicine (2004). In\nthe United States, there is a strong tradition of profes­\nsional self-regulation, particularly with respect to the\ndevelopment of ethical rules. See generally R. Rotunda &\nJ. Dzienkowski, Legal Ethics: The Lawyer’s Deskbook on\nProfessional Responsibility (2014); R. Baker, Before Bio­\nethics: A History of American Medical Ethics From the\nColonial Period to the Bioethics Revolution (2013). Den­\ntists are no exception. The American Dental Association,\nfor example, in an exercise of “the privilege and obligation\nof self-government,” has “call[ed] upon dentists to follow\nhigh ethical standards,” including “honesty, compassion,\nkindness, integrity, fairness and charity.”       American\nDental Association, Principles of Ethics and Code of Pro­\nfessional Conduct 3–4 (2012). State laws and institutions\nare sustained by this tradition when they draw upon the\nexpertise and commitment of professionals.\n   Today’s holding is not inconsistent with that idea. The\nBoard argues, however, that the potential for money dam­\nages will discourage members of regulated occupations\nfrom participating in state government. Cf. Filarsky v.\nDelia, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 12) (warning\nin the context of civil rights suits that the “the most tal­\nented candidates will decline public engagements if they\ndo not receive the same immunity enjoyed by their public\nemployee counterparts”). But this case, which does not\n16         NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                    EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\npresent a claim for money damages, does not offer occasion\nto address the question whether agency officials, including\nboard members, may, under some circumstances, enjoy\nimmunity from damages liability. See Goldfarb, 421 U. S.,\nat 792, n. 22; see also Brief for Respondent 56. And, of\ncourse, the States may provide for the defense and indem­\nnification of agency members in the event of litigation.\n  States, furthermore, can ensure Parker immunity is\navailable to agencies by adopting clear policies to displace\ncompetition; and, if agencies controlled by active market\nparticipants interpret or enforce those policies, the States\nmay provide active supervision. Precedent confirms this\nprinciple. The Court has rejected the argument that it\nwould be unwise to apply the antitrust laws to professional\nregulation absent compliance with the prerequisites for\ninvoking Parker immunity:\n     “[Respondents] contend that effective peer review is\n     essential to the provision of quality medical care and\n     that any threat of antitrust liability will prevent phy­\n     sicians from participating openly and actively in peer-\n     review proceedings. This argument, however, essen­\n     tially challenges the wisdom of applying the antitrust\n     laws to the sphere of medical care, and as such is\n     properly directed to the legislative branch. To the ex­\n     tent that Congress has declined to exempt medical\n     peer review from the reach of the antitrust laws, peer\n     review is immune from antitrust scrutiny only if the\n     State effectively has made this conduct its own.” Pat-\n     rick, 486 U. S. at 105–106 (footnote omitted).\n  The reasoning of Patrick v. Burget applies to this case\nwith full force, particularly in light of the risks licensing\nboards dominated by market participants may pose to the\nfree market. See generally Edlin & Haw, Cartels by An­\nother Name: Should Licensed Occupations Face Antitrust\nScrutiny? 162 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1093 (2014).\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              E\n  The Board does not contend in this Court that its anti­\ncompetitive conduct was actively supervised by the State\nor that it should receive Parker immunity on that basis.\n  By statute, North Carolina delegates control over the\npractice of dentistry to the Board. The Act, however, says\nnothing about teeth whitening, a practice that did not\nexist when it was passed. After receiving complaints from\nother dentists about the nondentists’ cheaper services, the\nBoard’s dentist members—some of whom offered whiten­\ning services—acted to expel the dentists’ competitors from\nthe market. In so doing the Board relied upon cease-and­\ndesist letters threatening criminal liability, rather than\nany of the powers at its disposal that would invoke over­\nsight by a politically accountable official. With no active\nsupervision by the State, North Carolina officials may well\nhave been unaware that the Board had decided teeth\nwhitening constitutes “the practice of dentistry” and\nsought to prohibit those who competed against dentists\nfrom participating in the teeth whitening market. Whether\nor not the Board exceeded its powers under North Carolina\nlaw, cf. Omni, 499 U. S., at 371–372, there is no evidence\nhere of any decision by the State to initiate or concur with\nthe Board’s actions against the nondentists.\n                             IV\n   The Board does not claim that the State exercised ac­\ntive, or indeed any, supervision over its conduct regarding\nnondentist teeth whiteners; and, as a result, no specific\nsupervisory systems can be reviewed here. It suffices to\nnote that the inquiry regarding active supervision is flexi­\nble and context-dependent. Active supervision need not\nentail day-to-day involvement in an agency’s operations or\nmicromanagement of its every decision. Rather, the ques­\ntion is whether the State’s review mechanisms provide\n“realistic assurance” that a nonsovereign actor’s anticom­\n18        NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD.

S., at 639–640.\n  The Court has identified only a few constant require­\nments of active supervision: The supervisor must review\nthe substance of the anticompetitive decision, not merely\nthe procedures followed to produce it, see Patrick, 486\nU. S., at 102–103; the supervisor must have the power to\nveto or modify particular decisions to ensure they accord\nwith state policy, see ibid.; and the “mere potential for\nstate supervision is not an adequate substitute for a deci­\nsion by the State,” Ticor, supra, at 638. Further, the state\nsupervisor may not itself be an active market participant.\nIn general, however, the adequacy of supervision other­\nwise will depend on all the circumstances of a case.\n                        *    *     *\n  The Sherman Act protects competition while also re­\nspecting federalism. It does not authorize the States to\nabandon markets to the unsupervised control of active\nmarket participants, whether trade associations or hybrid\nagencies. If a State wants to rely on active market partic­\nipants as regulators, it must provide active supervision if\nstate-action immunity under Parker is to be invoked.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit is affirmed.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943). In Parker,\nthe Court held that the Sherman Act does not prevent the\nStates from continuing their age-old practice of enacting\nmeasures, such as licensing requirements, that are de-\nsigned to protect the public health and welfare. Id., at\n352. The case now before us involves precisely this type of\nstate regulation—North Carolina’s laws governing the\npractice of dentistry, which are administered by the North\nCarolina Board of Dental Examiners (Board).\n   Today, however, the Court takes the unprecedented step\nof holding that Parker does not apply to the North Caro-\nlina Board because the Board is not structured in a way\nthat merits a good-government seal of approval; that is, it\nis made up of practicing dentists who have a financial\nincentive to use the licensing laws to further the financial\ninterests of the State’s dentists. There is nothing new\nabout the structure of the North Carolina Board. When\nthe States first created medical and dental boards, well\nbefore the Sherman Act was enacted, they began to staff\n2           NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD.

Professional and occupational\nlicensing requirements have often been used in such a\nway.2 But that is not what Parker immunity is about.\nIndeed, the very state program involved in that case was\nunquestionably designed to benefit the regulated entities,\nCalifornia raisin growers.\n   The question before us is not whether such programs\nserve the public interest. The question, instead, is whether\nthis case is controlled by Parker, and the answer to that\nquestion is clear. Under Parker, the Sherman Act (and\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act, see FTC v. Ticor Title\nIns. Co., 504 U. S. 621, 635 (1992)) do not apply to state\nagencies; the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners\nis a state agency; and that is the end of the matter. By\nstraying from this simple path, the Court has not only\ndistorted Parker; it has headed into a morass. Determin-\ning whether a state agency is structured in a way that\nmilitates against regulatory capture is no easy task, and\nthere is reason to fear that today’s decision will spawn\nconfusion. The Court has veered off course, and therefore\nI cannot go along.\n\n\n\n——————\n  1 S.

At\nthat time, this Court and Congress had an understanding\nof the scope of federal and state power that is very differ-\nent from our understanding today. The States were un-\nderstood to possess the exclusive authority to regulate\n“their purely internal affairs.” Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S.\n100, 122 (1890). In exercising their police power in this\narea, the States had long enacted measures, such as price\ncontrols and licensing requirements, that had the effect of\nrestraining trade.3\n   The Sherman Act was enacted pursuant to Congress’\npower to regulate interstate commerce, and in passing the\nAct, Congress wanted to exercise that power “to the ut-\nmost extent.” United States v. South-Eastern Underwrit-\ners Assn., 322 U. S. 533, 558 (1944). But in 1890, the\nunderstanding of the commerce power was far more lim-\nited than it is today. See, e.g., Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S.\n1, 17–18 (1888). As a result, the Act did not pose a threat\nto traditional state regulatory activity.\n   By 1943, when Parker was decided, however, the situa-\ntion had changed dramatically. This Court had held that\nthe commerce power permitted Congress to regulate even\nlocal activity if it “exerts a substantial economic effect on\ninterstate commerce.” Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111,\n125 (1942). This meant that Congress could regulate\nmany of the matters that had once been thought to fall\nexclusively within the jurisdiction of the States. The new\ninterpretation of the commerce power brought about an\nexpansion of the reach of the Sherman Act. See Hospital\n\n——————\n  3 See Handler, The Current Attack on the Parker v.

S. 738,\n743, n. 2 (1976) (“[D]ecisions by this Court have permitted\nthe reach of the Sherman Act to expand along with ex-\npanding notions of congressional power”). And the ex-\npanded reach of the Sherman Act raised an important\nquestion. The Sherman Act does not expressly exempt\nStates from its scope. Does that mean that the Act applies\nto the States and that it potentially outlaws many tradi-\ntional state regulatory measures? The Court confronted\nthat question in Parker.\n   In Parker, a raisin producer challenged the California\nAgricultural Prorate Act, an agricultural price support\nprogram. The California Act authorized the creation of an\nAgricultural Prorate Advisory Commission (Commission)\nto establish marketing plans for certain agricultural com-\nmodities within the State. 317 U. S., at 346–347. Raisins\nwere among the regulated commodities, and so the Com-\nmission established a marketing program that governed\nmany aspects of raisin sales, including the quality and\nquantity of raisins sold, the timing of sales, and the price\nat which raisins were sold. Id., at 347–348. The Parker\nCourt assumed that this program would have violated “the\nSherman Act if it were organized and made effective solely\nby virtue of a contract, combination or conspiracy of pri-\nvate persons,” and the Court also assumed that Congress\ncould have prohibited a State from creating a program like\nCalifornia’s if it had chosen to do so. Id., at 350. Never-\ntheless, the Court concluded that the California program\ndid not violate the Sherman Act because the Act did not\ncircumscribe state regulatory power. Id., at 351.\n   The Court’s holding in Parker was not based on either\nthe language of the Sherman Act or anything in the legis-\nlative history affirmatively showing that the Act was not\nmeant to apply to the States. Instead, the Court reasoned\nthat “[i]n a dual system of government in which, under the\nConstitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Con-\n                    Cite as: 574 U.

S., at 351. For the Congress that enacted\nthe Sherman Act in 1890, it would have been a truly radi-\ncal and almost certainly futile step to attempt to prevent\nthe States from exercising their traditional regulatory\nauthority, and the Parker Court refused to assume that\nthe Act was meant to have such an effect.\n   When the basis for the Parker state-action doctrine is\nunderstood, the Court’s error in this case is plain. In\n1890, the regulation of the practice of medicine and den-\ntistry was regarded as falling squarely within the States’\nsovereign police power. By that time, many States had\nestablished medical and dental boards, often staffed by\ndoctors or dentists,4 and had given those boards the au-\nthority to confer and revoke licenses.5 This was quintes-\nsential police power legislation, and although state laws\nwere often challenged during that era under the doctrine\nof substantive due process, the licensing of medical profes-\nsionals easily survived such assaults. Just one year before\nthe enactment of the Sherman Act, in Dent v. West Vir-\nginia, 129 U. S. 114, 128 (1889), this Court rejected such a\nchallenge to a state law requiring all physicians to obtain\na certificate from the state board of health attesting to\ntheir qualifications. And in Hawker v. New York, 170\nU. S. 189, 192 (1898), the Court reiterated that a law\n\n——————\n  4 Shrylock 54–55; D. Johnson and H.

S. 189 (1898), the Court cited state\n\nlaws authorizing such boards to refuse or revoke medical licenses. Id.,\nat 191–193, n. 1. See also Douglas v. Noble, 261 U. S. 165, 166 (1923)\n(“In 1893 the legislature of Washington provided that only licensed\npersons should practice dentistry” and “vested the authority to license\nin a board of examiners, consisting of five practicing dentists”).\n6         NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\nspecifying the qualifications to practice medicine was\nclearly a proper exercise of the police power. Thus, the\nNorth Carolina statutes establishing and specifying the\npowers of the State Board of Dental Examiners represent\nprecisely the kind of state regulation that the Parker\nexemption was meant to immunize.\n                               II\n  As noted above, the only question in this case is whether\nthe North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners is really a\nstate agency, and the answer to that question is clearly\nyes.\n   The North Carolina Legislature determined that the\n     practice of dentistry “affect[s] the public health, safety\n     and welfare” of North Carolina’s citizens and that\n     therefore the profession should be “subject to regula-\n     tion and control in the public interest” in order to en-\n     sure “that only qualified persons be permitted to\n     practice dentistry in the State.” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n     §90–22(a) (2013).\n   To further that end, the legislature created the North\n     Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners “as the\n     agency of the State for the regulation of the practice\n     of dentistry in th[e] State.” §90–22(b).\n   The legislature specified the membership of the\n     Board. §90–22(c). It defined the “practice of dentis-\n     try,” §90–29(b), and it set out standards for licensing\n     practitioners, §90–30. The legislature also set out\n     standards under which the Board can initiate disci-\n     plinary proceedings against licensees who engage in\n     certain improper acts. §90–41(a).\n   The legislature empowered the Board to “maintain an\n     action in the name of the State of North Carolina to\n     perpetually enjoin any person from . . . unlawfully\n     practicing dentistry.” §90–40.1(a). It authorized the\n     Board to conduct investigations and to hire legal\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

It has required that any such rules be in-\n     cluded in the Board’s annual report, which the Board\n     must file with the North Carolina secretary of state,\n     the state attorney general, and the legislature’s Joint\n     Regulatory Reform Committee. §93B–2. And if the\n     Board fails to file the required report, state law de-\n     mands that it be automatically suspended until it\n     does so. Ibid.\n   As this regulatory regime demonstrates, North Caro-\nlina’s Board of Dental Examiners is unmistakably a state\nagency created by the state legislature to serve a pre-\nscribed regulatory purpose and to do so using the State’s\npower in cooperation with other arms of state government.\n   The Board is not a private or “nonsovereign” entity that\nthe State of North Carolina has attempted to immunize\nfrom federal antitrust scrutiny. Parker made it clear that\na State may not “ ‘give immunity to those who violate the\nSherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by de-\nclaring that their action is lawful.’ ” Ante, at 7 (quoting\nParker, 317 U. S., at 351). When the Parker Court disap-\nproved of any such attempt, it cited Northern Securities\nCo. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197 (1904), to show what it\nhad in mind. In that case, the Court held that a State’s\nact of chartering a corporation did not shield the corpora-\ntion’s monopolizing activities from federal antitrust law.\nId., at 344–345. Nothing similar is involved here. North\nCarolina did not authorize a private entity to enter into an\nanticompetitive arrangement; rather, North Carolina\ncreated a state agency and gave that agency the power to\nregulate a particular subject affecting public health and\n8           NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                     EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsafety.\n   Nothing in Parker supports the type of inquiry that the\nCourt now prescribes. The Court crafts a test under which\nstate agencies that are “controlled by active market partic-\nipants,” ante, at 12, must demonstrate active state super-\nvision in order to be immune from federal antitrust law.\nThe Court thus treats these state agencies like private\nentities. But in Parker, the Court did not examine the\nstructure of the California program to determine if it had\nbeen captured by private interests. If the Court had done\nso, the case would certainly have come out differently,\nbecause California conditioned its regulatory measures on\nthe participation and approval of market actors in the\nrelevant industry.\n   Establishing a prorate marketing plan under Califor-\nnia’s law first required the petition of at least 10 producers\nof the particular commodity. Parker, 317 U. S., at 346. If\nthe Commission then agreed that a marketing plan was\nwarranted, the Commission would “select a program\ncommittee from among nominees chosen by the qualified\nproducers.” Ibid. (emphasis added). That committee\nwould then formulate the proration marketing program,\nwhich the Commission could modify or approve. But even\nafter Commission approval, the program became law (and\nthen, automatically) only if it gained the approval of 65\npercent of the relevant producers, representing at least 51\npercent of the acreage of the regulated crop. Id., at 347.\nThis scheme gave decisive power to market participants.\nBut despite these aspects of the California program, Par-\nker held that California was acting as a “sovereign” when\nit “adopt[ed] and enforc[ed] the prorate program.” Id., at\n352. This reasoning is irreconcilable with the Court’s\ntoday.\n                             III\n    The Court goes astray because it forgets the origin of the\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nParker doctrine and is misdirected by subsequent cases\nthat extended that doctrine (in certain circumstances) to\nprivate entities. The Court requires the North Carolina\nBoard to satisfy the two-part test set out in California\nRetail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445\nU. S. 97 (1980), but the party claiming Parker immunity in\nthat case was not a state agency but a private trade asso-\nciation. Such an entity is entitled to Parker immunity,\nMidcal held, only if the anticompetitive conduct at issue\nwas both “ ‘clearly articulated’ ” and “ ‘actively supervised\nby the State itself.’ ” 445 U. S., at 105. Those require-\nments are needed where a State authorizes private parties\nto engage in anticompetitive conduct. They serve to iden-\ntify those situations in which conduct by private parties\ncan be regarded as the conduct of a State. But when the\nconduct in question is the conduct of a state agency, no\nsuch inquiry is required.\n   This case falls into the latter category, and therefore\nMidcal is inapposite. The North Carolina Board is not a\nprivate trade association. It is a state agency, created and\nempowered by the State to regulate an industry affecting\npublic health. It would not exist if the State had not\ncreated it. And for purposes of Parker, its membership is\nirrelevant; what matters is that it is part of the govern-\nment of the sovereign State of North Carolina.\n   Our decision in Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34 (1985),\nwhich involved Sherman Act claims against a municipal-\nity, not a State agency, is similarly inapplicable. In Hal-\nlie, the plaintiff argued that the two-pronged Midcal test\nshould be applied, but the Court disagreed. The Court\nacknowledged that municipalities “are not themselves\nsovereign.” 471 U. S., at 38. But recognizing that a munic-\nipality is “an arm of the State,” id., at 45, the Court held\nthat a municipality should be required to satisfy only the\nfirst prong of the Midcal test (requiring a clearly articu-\nlated state policy), 471 U. S., at 46. That municipalities\n10        NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nare not sovereign was critical to our analysis in Hallie,\nand thus that decision has no application in a case, like\nthis one, involving a state agency.\n   Here, however, the Court not only disregards the North\nCarolina Board’s status as a full-fledged state agency; it\ntreats the Board less favorably than a municipality. This\nis puzzling. States are sovereign, Northern Ins. Co. of\nN. Y. v. Chatham County, 547 U. S. 189, 193 (2006), and\nCalifornia’s sovereignty provided the foundation for the\ndecision in Parker, supra, at 352. Municipalities are not\nsovereign. Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 466\n(2003). And for this reason, federal law often treats mu-\nnicipalities differently from States. Compare Will v. Mich-\nigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 71 (1989)\n(“[N]either a State nor its officials acting it their official\ncapacities are ‘persons’ under [42 U. S. C.] §1983”), with\nMonell v. City Dept. of Social Servs., New York, 436 U. S.\n658, 694 (1978) (municipalities liable under §1983 where\n“execution of a government’s policy or custom . . . inflicts\nthe injury”).\n   The Court recognizes that municipalities, although not\nsovereign, nevertheless benefit from a more lenient stand-\nard for state-action immunity than private entities. Yet\nunder the Court’s approach, the North Carolina Board of\nDental Examiners, a full-fledged state agency, is treated\nlike a private actor and must demonstrate that the State\nactively supervises its actions.\n   The Court’s analysis seems to be predicated on an as-\nsessment of the varying degrees to which a municipality\nand a state agency like the North Carolina Board are\nlikely to be captured by private interests. But until today,\nParker immunity was never conditioned on the proper use\nof state regulatory authority. On the contrary, in Colum-\nbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U. S. 365\n(1991), we refused to recognize an exception to Parker for\ncases in which it was shown that the defendants had\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

The\nSherman Act, we said, is not an anticorruption or good-\ngovernment statute. 499 U. S., at 398. We were unwilling\nin Omni to rewrite Parker in order to reach the allegedly\nabusive behavior of city officials. 499 U. S., at 374–379.\nBut that is essentially what the Court has done here.\n                              III\n   Not only is the Court’s decision inconsistent with the\nunderlying theory of Parker; it will create practical prob-\nlems and is likely to have far-reaching effects on the\nStates’ regulation of professions. As previously noted,\nstate medical and dental boards have been staffed by\npractitioners since they were first created, and there are\nobvious advantages to this approach. It is reasonable for\nStates to decide that the individuals best able to regulate\ntechnical professions are practitioners with expertise in\nthose very professions. Staffing the State Board of Dental\nExaminers with certified public accountants would cer-\ntainly lessen the risk of actions that place the well-being of\ndentists over those of the public, but this would also com-\npromise the State’s interest in sensibly regulating a tech-\nnical profession in which lay people have little expertise.\n   As a result of today’s decision, States may find it neces-\nsary to change the composition of medical, dental, and\nother boards, but it is not clear what sort of changes are\nneeded to satisfy the test that the Court now adopts. The\nCourt faults the structure of the North Carolina Board\nbecause “active market participants” constitute “a control-\nling number of [the] decisionmakers,” ante, at 14, but this\ntest raises many questions.\n   What is a “controlling number”? Is it a majority? And if\nso, why does the Court eschew that term? Or does the\nCourt mean to leave open the possibility that something\nless than a majority might suffice in particular circum-\n12          NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD.

Suppose that active market participants consti-\ntute a voting bloc that is generally able to get its way?\nHow about an obstructionist minority or an agency chair\nempowered to set the agenda or veto regulations?\n   Who is an “active market participant”? If Board mem-\nbers withdraw from practice during a short term of service\nbut typically return to practice when their terms end, does\nthat mean that they are not active market participants\nduring their period of service?\n   What is the scope of the market in which a member may\nnot participate while serving on the board? Must the\nmarket be relevant to the particular regulation being\nchallenged or merely to the jurisdiction of the entire agency?\nWould the result in the present case be different if a\nmajority of the Board members, though practicing den-\ntists, did not provide teeth whitening services? What if\nthey were orthodontists, periodontists, and the like? And\nhow much participation makes a person “active” in the\nmarket?\n   The answers to these questions are not obvious, but the\nStates must predict the answers in order to make in-\nformed choices about how to constitute their agencies.\n   I suppose that all this will be worked out by the lower\ncourts and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), but the\nCourt’s approach raises a more fundamental question, and\nthat is why the Court’s inquiry should stop with an exam-\nination of the structure of a state licensing board. When\nthe Court asks whether market participants control the\nNorth Carolina Board, the Court in essence is asking\nwhether this regulatory body has been captured by the\nentities that it is supposed to regulate. Regulatory cap-\nture can occur in many ways.6 So why ask only whether\n——————\n  6 See,\n       e.g., R. Noll, Reforming Regulation 40–43, 46 (1971); J.

Argued October 14, 2014—Decided February 25, 2015\nNorth Carolina’s Dental Practice Act (Act) provides that the North Car-\n olina State Board of Dental Examiners (Board) is “the agency of the\n State for the regulation of the practice of dentistry.” The Board’s\n principal duty is to create, administer, and enforce a licensing system\n for dentists; and six of its eight members must be licensed, practicing\n dentists.\n    The Act does not specify that teeth whitening is “the practice of\n dentistry.” Nonetheless, after dentists complained to the Board that\n nondentists were charging lower prices for such services than den-\n tists did, the Board issued at least 47 official cease-and-desist letters\n to nondentist teeth whitening service providers and product manu-\n facturers, often warning that the unlicensed practice of dentistry is a\n crime. This and other related Board actions led nondentists to cease\n offering teeth whitening services in North Carolina.\n    The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an administrative com-\n plaint, alleging that the Board’s concerted action to exclude\n nondentists from the market for teeth whitening services in North\n Carolina constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of compe-\n tition under the Federal Trade Commission Act. An Administrative\n Law Judge (ALJ) denied the Board’s motion to dismiss on the ground\n of state-action immunity. The FTC sustained that ruling, reasoning\n that even if the Board had acted pursuant to a clearly articulated\n state policy to displace competition, the Board must be actively su-\n pervised by the State to claim immunity, which it was not. After a\n hearing on the merits, the ALJ determined that the Board had un-\n reasonably restrained trade in violation of antitrust law. The FTC\n again sustained the ALJ, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed the FTC in\n2              NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                        EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                            Syllabus\n\n\n    all respects.\nHeld: Because a controlling number of the Board’s decisionmakers are\n active market participants in the occupation the Board regulates, the\n Board can invoke state-action antitrust immunity only if it was sub-\n ject to active supervision by the State, and here that requirement is\n not met. Pp. 5–18.\n     (a) Federal antitrust law is a central safeguard for the Nation’s free\n market structures. However, requiring States to conform to the\n mandates of the Sherman Act at the expense of other values a State\n may deem fundamental would impose an impermissible burden on\n the States’ power to regulate. Therefore, beginning with Parker v.\n Brown, 317 U. S. 341, this Court interpreted the antitrust laws to\n confer immunity on the anticompetitive conduct of States acting in\n their sovereign capacity. Pp. 5–6.\n     (b) The Board’s actions are not cloaked with Parker immunity. A\n nonsovereign actor controlled by active market participants—such as\n the Board—enjoys Parker immunity only if “ ‘the challenged restraint\n . . . [is] clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state poli-\n cy,’ and . . . ‘the policy . . . [is] actively supervised by the State.’ ”\n FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc., 568 U. S. ___, ___ (quoting\n California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445\n U. S. 97, 105). Here, the Board did not receive active supervision of\n its anticompetitive conduct. Pp. 6–17.\n        (1) An entity may not invoke Parker immunity unless its actions\n are an exercise of the State’s sovereign power. See Columbia v. Omni\n Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U. S. 365, 374. Thus, where a State\n delegates control over a market to a nonsovereign actor the Sherman\n Act confers immunity only if the State accepts political accountability\n for the anticompetitive conduct it permits and controls. Limits on\n state-action immunity are most essential when a State seeks to dele-\n gate its regulatory power to active market participants, for dual alle-\n giances are not always apparent to an actor and prohibitions against\n anticompetitive self-regulation by active market participants are an\n axiom of federal antitrust policy. Accordingly, Parker immunity re-\n quires that the anticompetitive conduct of nonsovereign actors, espe-\n cially those authorized by the State to regulate their own profession,\n result from procedures that suffice to make it the State’s own.\n Midcal’s two-part test provides a proper analytical framework to re-\n solve the ultimate question whether an anticompetitive policy is in-\n deed the policy of a State. The first requirement—clear articula-\n tion—rarely will achieve that goal by itself, for entities purporting to\n act under state authority might diverge from the State’s considered\n definition of the public good and engage in private self-dealing. The\n second Midcal requirement—active supervision—seeks to avoid this\n                   Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nharm by requiring the State to review and approve interstitial poli-\ncies made by the entity claiming immunity. Pp. 6–10.\n     (2) There are instances in which an actor can be excused from\nMidcal’s active supervision requirement. Municipalities, which are\nelectorally accountable, have general regulatory powers, and have no\nprivate price-fixing agenda, are subject exclusively to the clear articu-\nlation requirement. See Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34, 35. That\nHallie excused municipalities from Midcal’s supervision rule for\nthese reasons, however, all but confirms the rule’s applicability to ac-\ntors controlled by active market participants. Further, in light of\nOmni’s holding that an otherwise immune entity will not lose im-\nmunity based on ad hoc and ex post questioning of its motives for\nmaking particular decisions, 499 U. S., at 374, it is all the more nec-\nessary to ensure the conditions for granting immunity are met in the\nfirst place, see FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U. S. 621, 633, and\nPhoebe Putney, supra, at ___. The clear lesson of precedent is that\nMidcal’s active supervision test is an essential prerequisite of Parker\nimmunity for any nonsovereign entity—public or private—controlled\nby active market participants. Pp. 10–12.\n     (3) The Board’s argument that entities designated by the States\nas agencies are exempt from Midcal’s second requirement cannot be\nreconciled with the Court’s repeated conclusion that the need for su-\npervision turns not on the formal designation given by States to regu-\nlators but on the risk that active market participants will pursue pri-\nvate interests in restraining trade. State agencies controlled by\nactive market participants pose the very risk of self-dealing Midcal’s\nsupervision requirement was created to address. See Goldfarb v.\nVirginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 791. This conclusion does not\nquestion the good faith of state officers but rather is an assessment of\nthe structural risk of market participants’ confusing their own inter-\nests with the State’s policy goals. While Hallie stated “it is likely\nthat active state supervision would also not be required” for agencies,\n471 U. S., at 46, n. 10, the entity there was more like prototypical\nstate agencies, not specialized boards dominated by active market\nparticipants. The latter are similar to private trade associations\nvested by States with regulatory authority, which must satisfy\nMidcal’s active supervision standard. 445 U. S., at 105–106. The\nsimilarities between agencies controlled by active market partici-\npants and such associations are not eliminated simply because the\nformer are given a formal designation by the State, vested with a\nmeasure of government power, and required to follow some procedur-\nal rules. See Hallie, supra, at 39. When a State empowers a group of\nactive market participants to decide who can participate in its mar-\nket, and on what terms, the need for supervision is manifest. Thus,\n4             NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                       EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                           Syllabus\n\n\n    the Court holds today that a state board on which a controlling num-\n    ber of decisionmakers are active market participants in the occupa-\n    tion the board regulates must satisfy Midcal’s active supervision re-\n    quirement in order to invoke state-action antitrust immunity.\n    Pp. 12–14.\n          (4) The State argues that allowing this FTC order to stand will\n    discourage dedicated citizens from serving on state agencies that\n    regulate their own occupation. But this holding is not inconsistent\n    with the idea that those who pursue a calling must embrace ethical\n    standards that derive from a duty separate from the dictates of the\n    State. Further, this case does not offer occasion to address the ques-\n    tion whether agency officials, including board members, may, under\n    some circumstances, enjoy immunity from damages liability. Of\n    course, States may provide for the defense and indemnification of\n    agency members in the event of litigation, and they can also ensure\n    Parker immunity is available by adopting clear policies to displace\n    competition and providing active supervision. Arguments against the\n    wisdom of applying the antitrust laws to professional regulation ab-\n    sent compliance with the prerequisites for invoking Parker immunity\n    must be rejected, see Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94, 105–106, partic-\n    ularly in light of the risks licensing boards dominated by market par-\n    ticipants may pose to the free market. Pp. 14–16.\n          (5) The Board does not contend in this Court that its anticompet-\n    itive conduct was actively supervised by the State or that it should\n    receive Parker immunity on that basis. The Act delegates control\n    over the practice of dentistry to the Board, but says nothing about\n    teeth whitening. In acting to expel the dentists’ competitors from the\n    market, the Board relied on cease-and-desist letters threatening\n    criminal liability, instead of other powers at its disposal that would\n    have invoked oversight by a politically accountable official. Whether\n    or not the Board exceeded its powers under North Carolina law, there\n    is no evidence of any decision by the State to initiate or concur with\n    the Board’s actions against the nondentists. P. 17.\n       (c) Here, where there are no specific supervisory systems to be re-\n    viewed, it suffices to note that the inquiry regarding active supervi-\n    sion is flexible and context-dependent. The question is whether the\n    State’s review mechanisms provide “realistic assurance” that a non-\n    sovereign actor’s anticompetitive conduct “promotes state policy, ra-\n    ther than merely the party’s individual interests.” Patrick, 486 U. S.,\n    100–101. The Court has identified only a few constant requirements\n    of active supervision: The supervisor must review the substance of\n    the anticompetitive decision, see id., at 102–103; the supervisor must\n    have the power to veto or modify particular decisions to ensure they\n    accord with state policy, see ibid.; and the “mere potential for state\n                     Cite as: 574 U.

Further, the state supervisor may not itself be\n  an active market participant.

A majority of the\nboard’s members are engaged in the active practice of\nthe profession it regulates. The question is whether the\nboard’s actions are protected from Sherman Act regulation\nunder the doctrine of state-action antitrust immunity, as\ndefined and applied in this Court’s decisions beginning\nwith Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943).\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  In its Dental Practice Act (Act), North Carolina has\ndeclared the practice of dentistry to be a matter of public\nconcern requiring regulation. N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §90–\n22(a) (2013). Under the Act, the North Carolina State\nBoard of Dental Examiners (Board) is “the agency of the\nState for the regulation of the practice of dentistry.” §90–\n22(b).\n  The Board’s principal duty is to create, administer, and\nenforce a licensing system for dentists. See §§90–29 to\n2         NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n90–41. To perform that function it has broad authority\nover licensees. See §90–41. The Board’s authority with\nrespect to unlicensed persons, however, is more restricted:\nlike “any resident citizen,” the Board may file suit to\n“perpetually enjoin any person from . . . unlawfully prac­\nticing dentistry.” §90–40.1.\n   The Act provides that six of the Board’s eight members\nmust be licensed dentists engaged in the active practice of\ndentistry. §90–22. They are elected by other licensed\ndentists in North Carolina, who cast their ballots in elec­\ntions conducted by the Board. Ibid. The seventh member\nmust be a licensed and practicing dental hygienist, and he\nor she is elected by other licensed hygienists. Ibid. The\nfinal member is referred to by the Act as a “consumer” and\nis appointed by the Governor. Ibid. All members serve\n3-year terms, and no person may serve more than two con­\nsecutive terms. Ibid. The Act does not create any mecha­\nnism for the removal of an elected member of the Board by\na public official. See ibid.\n   Board members swear an oath of office, §138A–22(a),\nand the Board must comply with the State’s Administra­\ntive Procedure Act, §150B–1 et seq., Public Records Act,\n§132–1 et seq., and open-meetings law, §143–318.9 et seq.\nThe Board may promulgate rules and regulations govern­\ning the practice of dentistry within the State, provided\nthose mandates are not inconsistent with the Act and are\napproved by the North Carolina Rules Review Commis­\nsion, whose members are appointed by the state legisla­\nture. See §§90–48, 143B–30.1, 150B–21.9(a).\n                              B\n  In the 1990’s, dentists in North Carolina started whiten­\ning teeth. Many of those who did so, including 8 of the\nBoard’s 10 members during the period at issue in this\ncase, earned substantial fees for that service. By 2003,\nnondentists arrived on the scene. They charged lower\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprices for their services than the dentists did. Dentists\nsoon began to complain to the Board about their new\ncompetitors. Few complaints warned of possible harm to\nconsumers. Most expressed a principal concern with the\nlow prices charged by nondentists.\n   Responding to these filings, the Board opened an inves­\ntigation into nondentist teeth whitening. A dentist mem­\nber was placed in charge of the inquiry. Neither the\nBoard’s hygienist member nor its consumer member par­\nticipated in this undertaking. The Board’s chief opera­\ntions officer remarked that the Board was “going forth to\ndo battle” with nondentists. App. to Pet. for Cert. 103a.\nThe Board’s concern did not result in a formal rule or\nregulation reviewable by the independent Rules Review\nCommission, even though the Act does not, by its terms,\nspecify that teeth whitening is “the practice of dentistry.”\n   Starting in 2006, the Board issued at least 47 cease-and­\ndesist letters on its official letterhead to nondentist teeth\nwhitening service providers and product manufacturers.\nMany of those letters directed the recipient to cease “all\nactivity constituting the practice of dentistry”; warned\nthat the unlicensed practice of dentistry is a crime; and\nstrongly implied (or expressly stated) that teeth whitening\nconstitutes “the practice of dentistry.” App. 13, 15. In\nearly 2007, the Board persuaded the North Carolina\nBoard of Cosmetic Art Examiners to warn cosmetologists\nagainst providing teeth whitening services. Later that\nyear, the Board sent letters to mall operators, stating that\nkiosk teeth whiteners were violating the Dental Practice\nAct and advising that the malls consider expelling viola­\ntors from their premises.\n   These actions had the intended result. Nondentists\nceased offering teeth whitening services in North Carolina.\n                           C\n  In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an\n4         NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nadministrative complaint charging the Board with violat­\ning §5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 719,\nas amended, 15 U. S. C. §45. The FTC alleged that the\nBoard’s concerted action to exclude nondentists from the\nmarket for teeth whitening services in North Carolina\nconstituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of com­\npetition. The Board moved to dismiss, alleging state-\naction immunity. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)\ndenied the motion. On appeal, the FTC sustained the\nALJ’s ruling. It reasoned that, even assuming the Board\nhad acted pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy to\ndisplace competition, the Board is a “public/private hy­\nbrid” that must be actively supervised by the State to\nclaim immunity. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. The FTC\nfurther concluded the Board could not make that showing.\n   Following other proceedings not relevant here, the ALJ\nconducted a hearing on the merits and determined the\nBoard had unreasonably restrained trade in violation of\nantitrust law. On appeal, the FTC again sustained the\nALJ. The FTC rejected the Board’s public safety justifica­\ntion, noting, inter alia, “a wealth of evidence . . . suggest­\ning that non-dentist provided teeth whitening is a safe\ncosmetic procedure.” Id., at 123a.\n   The FTC ordered the Board to stop sending the cease­\nand-desist letters or other communications that stated\nnondentists may not offer teeth whitening services and\nproducts. It further ordered the Board to issue notices to\nall earlier recipients of the Board’s cease-and-desist orders\nadvising them of the Board’s proper sphere of authority\nand saying, among other options, that the notice recipients\nhad a right to seek declaratory rulings in state court.\n   On petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit affirmed the FTC in all respects. 717 F. 3d\n359, 370 (2013). This Court granted certiorari. 571 U. S.\n___ (2014).\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

In this regard it is “as\nimportant to the preservation of economic freedom and our\nfree-enterprise system as the Bill of Rights is to the pro­\ntection of our fundamental personal freedoms.” United\nStates v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U. S. 596, 610 (1972).\nThe antitrust laws declare a considered and decisive pro­\nhibition by the Federal Government of cartels, price fixing,\nand other combinations or practices that undermine the\nfree market.\n  The Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C.\n§1 et seq., serves to promote robust competition, which in\nturn empowers the States and provides their citizens with\nopportunities to pursue their own and the public’s welfare.\nSee FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U. S. 621, 632 (1992).\nThe States, however, when acting in their respective\nrealm, need not adhere in all contexts to a model of unfet­\ntered competition. While “the States regulate their econ­\nomies in many ways not inconsistent with the antitrust\nlaws,” id., at 635–636, in some spheres they impose re­\nstrictions on occupations, confer exclusive or shared rights\nto dominate a market, or otherwise limit competition to\nachieve public objectives. If every duly enacted state law\nor policy were required to conform to the mandates of the\nSherman Act, thus promoting competition at the expense\nof other values a State may deem fundamental, federal\nantitrust law would impose an impermissible burden on\nthe States’ power to regulate. See Exxon Corp. v. Gover-\nnor of Maryland, 437 U. S. 117, 133 (1978); see also\nEasterbrook, Antitrust and the Economics of Federalism,\n26 J. Law & Econ. 23, 24 (1983).\n  For these reasons, the Court in Parker v. Brown inter­\npreted the antitrust laws to confer immunity on anticom­\npetitive conduct by the States when acting in their sover­\neign capacity. See 317 U. S., at 350–351. That ruling\n6          NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                    EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nrecognized Congress’ purpose to respect the federal bal­\nance and to “embody in the Sherman Act the federalism\nprinciple that the States possess a significant measure of\nsovereignty under our Constitution.” Community Com-\nmunications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U. S. 40, 53 (1982). Since\n1943, the Court has reaffirmed the importance of Parker’s\ncentral holding. See, e.g., Ticor, supra, at 632–637; Hoover\nv. Ronwin, 466 U. S. 558, 568 (1984); Lafayette v. Louisi-\nana Power & Light Co., 435 U. S. 389, 394–400 (1978).\n                             III\n   In this case the Board argues its members were invested\nby North Carolina with the power of the State and that, as\na result, the Board’s actions are cloaked with Parker\nimmunity. This argument fails, however. A nonsovereign\nactor controlled by active market participants—such as\nthe Board—enjoys Parker immunity only if it satisfies two\nrequirements: “first that ‘the challenged restraint . . . be\none clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as\nstate policy,’ and second that ‘the policy . . . be actively\nsupervised by the State.’ ” FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health\nSystem, Inc., 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 7) (quot­\ning California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Alu-\nminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97, 105 (1980)). The parties have\nassumed that the clear articulation requirement is satis­\nfied, and we do the same. While North Carolina prohibits\nthe unauthorized practice of dentistry, however, its Act is\nsilent on whether that broad prohibition covers teeth\nwhitening. Here, the Board did not receive active super­\nvision by the State when it interpreted the Act as ad­\ndressing teeth whitening and when it enforced that policy\nby issuing cease-and-desist letters to nondentist teeth\nwhiteners.\n                             A\n    Although state-action immunity exists to avoid conflicts\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween state sovereignty and the Nation’s commitment to\na policy of robust competition, Parker immunity is not\nunbounded. “[G]iven the fundamental national values of\nfree enterprise and economic competition that are embod­\nied in the federal antitrust laws, ‘state action immunity is\ndisfavored, much as are repeals by implication.’ ” Phoebe\nPutney, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quoting Ticor, supra,\nat 636).\n  An entity may not invoke Parker immunity unless the\nactions in question are an exercise of the State’s sovereign\npower. See Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc.,\n499 U. S. 365, 374 (1991). State legislation and “deci­\nsion[s] of a state supreme court, acting legislatively rather\nthan judicially,” will satisfy this standard, and “ipso facto\nare exempt from the operation of the antitrust laws” be­\ncause they are an undoubted exercise of state sovereign\nauthority. Hoover, supra, at 567–568.\n  But while the Sherman Act confers immunity on the\nStates’ own anticompetitive policies out of respect for\nfederalism, it does not always confer immunity where, as\nhere, a State delegates control over a market to a non-\nsovereign actor. See Parker, supra, at 351 (“[A] state does\nnot give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act\nby authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their\naction is lawful”). For purposes of Parker, a nonsovereign\nactor is one whose conduct does not automatically qualify\nas that of the sovereign State itself. See Hoover, supra, at\n567–568. State agencies are not simply by their govern­\nmental character sovereign actors for purposes of state-\naction immunity. See Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421\nU. S. 773, 791 (1975) (“The fact that the State Bar is a\nstate agency for some limited purposes does not create an\nantitrust shield that allows it to foster anticompetitive\npractices for the benefit of its members”). Immunity for\nstate agencies, therefore, requires more than a mere fa­\ncade of state involvement, for it is necessary in light of\n8         NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nParker’s rationale to ensure the States accept political\naccountability for anticompetitive conduct they permit and\ncontrol. See Ticor, 504 U. S., at 636.\n   Limits on state-action immunity are most essential\nwhen the State seeks to delegate its regulatory power to\nactive market participants, for established ethical stand­\nards may blend with private anticompetitive motives in a\nway difficult even for market participants to discern. Dual\nallegiances are not always apparent to an actor. In conse­\nquence, active market participants cannot be allowed to\nregulate their own markets free from antitrust account­\nability. See Midcal, supra, at 106 (“The national policy in\nfavor of competition cannot be thwarted by casting [a]\ngauzy cloak of state involvement over what is essentially a\nprivate price-fixing arrangement”). Indeed, prohibitions\nagainst anticompetitive self-regulation by active market\nparticipants are an axiom of federal antitrust policy. See,\ne.g., Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486\nU. S. 492, 501 (1988); Hoover, supra, at 584 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting) (“The risk that private regulation of market\nentry, prices, or output may be designed to confer monop­\noly profits on members of an industry at the expense of the\nconsuming public has been the central concern of . . . our\nantitrust jurisprudence”); see also Elhauge, The Scope of\nAntitrust Process, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 667, 672 (1991). So it\nfollows that, under Parker and the Supremacy Clause, the\nStates’ greater power to attain an end does not include the\nlesser power to negate the congressional judgment embod­\nied in the Sherman Act through unsupervised delegations\nto active market participants. See Garland, Antitrust and\nState Action: Economic Efficiency and the Political Pro­\ncess, 96 Yale L. J. 486, 500 (1986).\n   Parker immunity requires that the anticompetitive\nconduct of nonsovereign actors, especially those author­\nized by the State to regulate their own profession, result\nfrom procedures that suffice to make it the State’s own.\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Goldfarb, supra, at 790; see also 1A P. Areeda & H.\nHovencamp, Antitrust Law ¶226, p. 180 (4th ed. 2013)\n(Areeda & Hovencamp). The question is not whether the\nchallenged conduct is efficient, well-functioning, or wise.\nSee Ticor, supra, at 634–635. Rather, it is “whether anti­\ncompetitive conduct engaged in by [nonsovereign actors]\nshould be deemed state action and thus shielded from the\nantitrust laws.” Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94, 100\n(1988).\n   To answer this question, the Court applies the two-part\ntest set forth in California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v.\nMidcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97, a case arising from\nCalifornia’s delegation of price-fixing authority to wine\nmerchants. Under Midcal, “[a] state law or regulatory\nscheme cannot be the basis for antitrust immunity unless,\nfirst, the State has articulated a clear policy to allow the\nanticompetitive conduct, and second, the State provides\nactive supervision of [the] anticompetitive conduct.” Ticor,\nsupra, at 631 (citing Midcal, supra, at 105).\n   Midcal’s clear articulation requirement is satisfied\n“where the displacement of competition [is] the inherent,\nlogical, or ordinary result of the exercise of authority\ndelegated by the state legislature. In that scenario, the\nState must have foreseen and implicitly endorsed the\nanticompetitive effects as consistent with its policy goals.”\nPhoebe Putney, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). The\nactive supervision requirement demands, inter alia, “that\nstate officials have and exercise power to review particular\nanticompetitive acts of private parties and disapprove\nthose that fail to accord with state policy.” Patrick, supra,\nU. S., at 101.\n   The two requirements set forth in Midcal provide a\nproper analytical framework to resolve the ultimate ques­\ntion whether an anticompetitive policy is indeed the policy\nof a State. The first requirement—clear articulation—\nrarely will achieve that goal by itself, for a policy may\n10        NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nsatisfy this test yet still be defined at so high a level of\ngenerality as to leave open critical questions about how\nand to what extent the market should be regulated. See\nTicor, supra, at 636–637. Entities purporting to act under\nstate authority might diverge from the State’s considered\ndefinition of the public good. The resulting asymmetry\nbetween a state policy and its implementation can invite\nprivate self-dealing. The second Midcal requirement—\nactive supervision—seeks to avoid this harm by requiring\nthe State to review and approve interstitial policies made\nby the entity claiming immunity.\n   Midcal’s supervision rule “stems from the recognition\nthat ‘[w]here a private party is engaging in anticompeti­\ntive activity, there is a real danger that he is acting to\nfurther his own interests, rather than the governmental\ninterests of the State.’ ” Patrick, supra, at 100. Concern\nabout the private incentives of active market participants\nanimates Midcal’s supervision mandate, which demands\n“realistic assurance that a private party’s anticompetitive\nconduct promotes state policy, rather than merely the\nparty’s individual interests.” Patrick, supra, at 101.\n                               B\n    In determining whether anticompetitive policies and\nconduct are indeed the action of a State in its sovereign\ncapacity, there are instances in which an actor can be\nexcused from Midcal’s active supervision requirement. In\nHallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34, 45 (1985), the Court\nheld municipalities are subject exclusively to Midcal’s\n“ ‘clear articulation’ ” requirement. That rule, the Court\nobserved, is consistent with the objective of ensuring that\nthe policy at issue be one enacted by the State itself.\nHallie explained that “[w]here the actor is a municipality,\nthere is little or no danger that it is involved in a private\nprice-fixing arrangement. The only real danger is that it\nwill seek to further purely parochial public interests at the\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpense of more overriding state goals.” 471 U. S., at 47.\nHallie further observed that municipalities are electorally\naccountable and lack the kind of private incentives charac­\nteristic of active participants in the market. See id., at 45,\nn. 9. Critically, the municipality in Hallie exercised a\nwide range of governmental powers across different eco­\nnomic spheres, substantially reducing the risk that it\nwould pursue private interests while regulating any single\nfield. See ibid. That Hallie excused municipalities from\nMidcal’s supervision rule for these reasons all but con­\nfirms the rule’s applicability to actors controlled by active\nmarket participants, who ordinarily have none of the\nfeatures justifying the narrow exception Hallie identified.\nSee 471 U. S., at 45.\n   Following Goldfarb, Midcal, and Hallie, which clarified\nthe conditions under which Parker immunity attaches to\nthe conduct of a nonsovereign actor, the Court in Colum-\nbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U. S. 365,\naddressed whether an otherwise immune entity could lose\nimmunity for conspiring with private parties. In Omni, an\naspiring billboard merchant argued that the city of Co­\nlumbia, South Carolina, had violated the Sherman Act—\nand forfeited its Parker immunity—by anticompetitively\nconspiring with an established local company in passing\nan ordinance restricting new billboard construction. 499\nU. S., at 367–368. The Court disagreed, holding there is\nno “conspiracy exception” to Parker. Omni, supra, at 374.\n   Omni, like the cases before it, recognized the importance\nof drawing a line “relevant to the purposes of the Sherman\nAct and of Parker: prohibiting the restriction of competi­\ntion for private gain but permitting the restriction of\ncompetition in the public interest.” 499 U. S., at 378. In\nthe context of a municipal actor which, as in Hallie, exer­\ncised substantial governmental powers, Omni rejected a\nconspiracy exception for “corruption” as vague and un­\nworkable, since “virtually all regulation benefits some\n12        NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsegments of the society and harms others” and may in that\nsense be seen as “ ‘corrupt.’ ” 499 U. S., at 377. Omni also\nrejected subjective tests for corruption that would force a\n“deconstruction of the governmental process and probing\nof the official ‘intent’ that we have consistently sought to\navoid.” Ibid. Thus, whereas the cases preceding it ad­\ndressed the preconditions of Parker immunity and en­\ngaged in an objective, ex ante inquiry into nonsovereign\nactors’ structure and incentives, Omni made clear that\nrecipients of immunity will not lose it on the basis of\nad hoc and ex post questioning of their motives for making\nparticular decisions.\n   Omni’s holding makes it all the more necessary to en­\nsure the conditions for granting immunity are met in the\nfirst place. The Court’s two state-action immunity cases\ndecided after Omni reinforce this point. In Ticor the Court\naffirmed that Midcal’s limits on delegation must ensure\nthat “[a]ctual state involvement, not deference to private\nprice-fixing arrangements under the general auspices of\nstate law, is the precondition for immunity from federal\nlaw.” 504 U. S., at 633. And in Phoebe Putney the Court\nobserved that Midcal’s active supervision requirement, in\nparticular, is an essential condition of state-action immun­\nity when a nonsovereign actor has “an incentive to pursue\n[its] own self-interest under the guise of implementing\nstate policies.” 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quoting\nHallie, supra, at 46–47). The lesson is clear: Midcal’s\nactive supervision test is an essential prerequisite of\nParker immunity for any nonsovereign entity—public or\nprivate—controlled by active market participants.\n                            C\n  The Board argues entities designated by the States as\nagencies are exempt from Midcal’s second requirement.\nThat premise, however, cannot be reconciled with the\nCourt’s repeated conclusion that the need for supervision\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nturns not on the formal designation given by States to\nregulators but on the risk that active market participants\nwill pursue private interests in restraining trade.\n   State agencies controlled by active market participants,\nwho possess singularly strong private interests, pose the\nvery risk of self-dealing Midcal’s supervision requirement\nwas created to address. See Areeda & Hovencamp ¶227,\nat 226. This conclusion does not question the good faith of\nstate officers but rather is an assessment of the structural\nrisk of market participants’ confusing their own interests\nwith the State’s policy goals. See Patrick, 486 U. S., at\n100–101.\n   The Court applied this reasoning to a state agency in\nGoldfarb. There the Court denied immunity to a state\nagency (the Virginia State Bar) controlled by market\nparticipants (lawyers) because the agency had “joined in\nwhat is essentially a private anticompetitive activity” for\n“the benefit of its members.” 421 U. S., at 791, 792. This\nemphasis on the Bar’s private interests explains why\nGoldfarb, though it predates Midcal, considered the lack\nof supervision by the Virginia Supreme Court to be a\nprincipal reason for denying immunity. See 421 U. S., at\n791; see also Hoover, 466 U. S., at 569 (emphasizing lack\nof active supervision in Goldfarb); Bates v. State Bar of\nAriz., 433 U. S. 350, 361–362 (1977) (granting the Arizona\nBar state-action immunity partly because its “rules are\nsubject to pointed re-examination by the policymaker”).\n   While Hallie stated “it is likely that active state super­\nvision would also not be required” for agencies, 471 U. S.,\nat 46, n. 10, the entity there, as was later the case in\nOmni, was an electorally accountable municipality with\ngeneral regulatory powers and no private price-fixing\nagenda. In that and other respects the municipality was\nmore like prototypical state agencies, not specialized\nboards dominated by active market participants. In im­\nportant regards, agencies controlled by market partici­\n14        NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\npants are more similar to private trade associations vested\nby States with regulatory authority than to the agencies\nHallie considered. And as the Court observed three years\nafter Hallie, “[t]here is no doubt that the members of such\nassociations often have economic incentives to restrain\ncompetition and that the product standards set by such\nassociations have a serious potential for anticompetitive\nharm.” Allied Tube, 486 U. S., at 500. For that reason,\nthose associations must satisfy Midcal’s active supervision\nstandard. See Midcal, 445 U. S., at 105–106.\n   The similarities between agencies controlled by active\nmarket participants and private trade associations are not\neliminated simply because the former are given a formal\ndesignation by the State, vested with a measure of gov­\nernment power, and required to follow some procedural\nrules. See Hallie, supra, at 39 (rejecting “purely formalis­\ntic” analysis). Parker immunity does not derive from\nnomenclature alone. When a State empowers a group of\nactive market participants to decide who can participate\nin its market, and on what terms, the need for supervision\nis manifest. See Areeda & Hovencamp ¶227, at 226. The\nCourt holds today that a state board on which a control­\nling number of decisionmakers are active market partici­\npants in the occupation the board regulates must satisfy\nMidcal’s active supervision requirement in order to invoke\nstate-action antitrust immunity.\n                            D\n  The State argues that allowing this FTC order to stand\nwill discourage dedicated citizens from serving on state\nagencies that regulate their own occupation. If this were\nso—and, for reasons to be noted, it need not be so—there\nwould be some cause for concern. The States have a sov­\nereign interest in structuring their governments, see\nGregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991), and may\nconclude there are substantial benefits to staffing their\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

United\nStates, 471 U. S. 48, 64 (1985). There is, moreover, a long\ntradition of citizens esteemed by their professional col­\nleagues devoting time, energy, and talent to enhancing the\ndignity of their calling.\n   Adherence to the idea that those who pursue a calling\nmust embrace ethical standards that derive from a duty\nseparate from the dictates of the State reaches back at\nleast to the Hippocratic Oath. See generally S. Miles, The\nHippocratic Oath and the Ethics of Medicine (2004). In\nthe United States, there is a strong tradition of profes­\nsional self-regulation, particularly with respect to the\ndevelopment of ethical rules. See generally R. Rotunda &\nJ. Dzienkowski, Legal Ethics: The Lawyer’s Deskbook on\nProfessional Responsibility (2014); R. Baker, Before Bio­\nethics: A History of American Medical Ethics From the\nColonial Period to the Bioethics Revolution (2013). Den­\ntists are no exception. The American Dental Association,\nfor example, in an exercise of “the privilege and obligation\nof self-government,” has “call[ed] upon dentists to follow\nhigh ethical standards,” including “honesty, compassion,\nkindness, integrity, fairness and charity.”       American\nDental Association, Principles of Ethics and Code of Pro­\nfessional Conduct 3–4 (2012). State laws and institutions\nare sustained by this tradition when they draw upon the\nexpertise and commitment of professionals.\n   Today’s holding is not inconsistent with that idea. The\nBoard argues, however, that the potential for money dam­\nages will discourage members of regulated occupations\nfrom participating in state government. Cf. Filarsky v.\nDelia, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 12) (warning\nin the context of civil rights suits that the “the most tal­\nented candidates will decline public engagements if they\ndo not receive the same immunity enjoyed by their public\nemployee counterparts”). But this case, which does not\n16         NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                    EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\npresent a claim for money damages, does not offer occasion\nto address the question whether agency officials, including\nboard members, may, under some circumstances, enjoy\nimmunity from damages liability. See Goldfarb, 421 U. S.,\nat 792, n. 22; see also Brief for Respondent 56. And, of\ncourse, the States may provide for the defense and indem­\nnification of agency members in the event of litigation.\n  States, furthermore, can ensure Parker immunity is\navailable to agencies by adopting clear policies to displace\ncompetition; and, if agencies controlled by active market\nparticipants interpret or enforce those policies, the States\nmay provide active supervision. Precedent confirms this\nprinciple. The Court has rejected the argument that it\nwould be unwise to apply the antitrust laws to professional\nregulation absent compliance with the prerequisites for\ninvoking Parker immunity:\n     “[Respondents] contend that effective peer review is\n     essential to the provision of quality medical care and\n     that any threat of antitrust liability will prevent phy­\n     sicians from participating openly and actively in peer-\n     review proceedings. This argument, however, essen­\n     tially challenges the wisdom of applying the antitrust\n     laws to the sphere of medical care, and as such is\n     properly directed to the legislative branch. To the ex­\n     tent that Congress has declined to exempt medical\n     peer review from the reach of the antitrust laws, peer\n     review is immune from antitrust scrutiny only if the\n     State effectively has made this conduct its own.” Pat-\n     rick, 486 U. S. at 105–106 (footnote omitted).\n  The reasoning of Patrick v. Burget applies to this case\nwith full force, particularly in light of the risks licensing\nboards dominated by market participants may pose to the\nfree market. See generally Edlin & Haw, Cartels by An­\nother Name: Should Licensed Occupations Face Antitrust\nScrutiny? 162 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1093 (2014).\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              E\n  The Board does not contend in this Court that its anti­\ncompetitive conduct was actively supervised by the State\nor that it should receive Parker immunity on that basis.\n  By statute, North Carolina delegates control over the\npractice of dentistry to the Board. The Act, however, says\nnothing about teeth whitening, a practice that did not\nexist when it was passed. After receiving complaints from\nother dentists about the nondentists’ cheaper services, the\nBoard’s dentist members—some of whom offered whiten­\ning services—acted to expel the dentists’ competitors from\nthe market. In so doing the Board relied upon cease-and­\ndesist letters threatening criminal liability, rather than\nany of the powers at its disposal that would invoke over­\nsight by a politically accountable official. With no active\nsupervision by the State, North Carolina officials may well\nhave been unaware that the Board had decided teeth\nwhitening constitutes “the practice of dentistry” and\nsought to prohibit those who competed against dentists\nfrom participating in the teeth whitening market. Whether\nor not the Board exceeded its powers under North Carolina\nlaw, cf. Omni, 499 U. S., at 371–372, there is no evidence\nhere of any decision by the State to initiate or concur with\nthe Board’s actions against the nondentists.\n                             IV\n   The Board does not claim that the State exercised ac­\ntive, or indeed any, supervision over its conduct regarding\nnondentist teeth whiteners; and, as a result, no specific\nsupervisory systems can be reviewed here. It suffices to\nnote that the inquiry regarding active supervision is flexi­\nble and context-dependent. Active supervision need not\nentail day-to-day involvement in an agency’s operations or\nmicromanagement of its every decision. Rather, the ques­\ntion is whether the State’s review mechanisms provide\n“realistic assurance” that a nonsovereign actor’s anticom­\n18        NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD.

S., at 639–640.\n  The Court has identified only a few constant require­\nments of active supervision: The supervisor must review\nthe substance of the anticompetitive decision, not merely\nthe procedures followed to produce it, see Patrick, 486\nU. S., at 102–103; the supervisor must have the power to\nveto or modify particular decisions to ensure they accord\nwith state policy, see ibid.; and the “mere potential for\nstate supervision is not an adequate substitute for a deci­\nsion by the State,” Ticor, supra, at 638. Further, the state\nsupervisor may not itself be an active market participant.\nIn general, however, the adequacy of supervision other­\nwise will depend on all the circumstances of a case.\n                        *    *     *\n  The Sherman Act protects competition while also re­\nspecting federalism. It does not authorize the States to\nabandon markets to the unsupervised control of active\nmarket participants, whether trade associations or hybrid\nagencies. If a State wants to rely on active market partic­\nipants as regulators, it must provide active supervision if\nstate-action immunity under Parker is to be invoked.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit is affirmed.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943). In Parker,\nthe Court held that the Sherman Act does not prevent the\nStates from continuing their age-old practice of enacting\nmeasures, such as licensing requirements, that are de-\nsigned to protect the public health and welfare. Id., at\n352. The case now before us involves precisely this type of\nstate regulation—North Carolina’s laws governing the\npractice of dentistry, which are administered by the North\nCarolina Board of Dental Examiners (Board).\n   Today, however, the Court takes the unprecedented step\nof holding that Parker does not apply to the North Caro-\nlina Board because the Board is not structured in a way\nthat merits a good-government seal of approval; that is, it\nis made up of practicing dentists who have a financial\nincentive to use the licensing laws to further the financial\ninterests of the State’s dentists. There is nothing new\nabout the structure of the North Carolina Board. When\nthe States first created medical and dental boards, well\nbefore the Sherman Act was enacted, they began to staff\n2           NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                     EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthem in this way.1 Nor is there anything new about the\nsuspicion that the North Carolina Board—in attempting to\nprevent persons other than dentists from performing\nteeth-whitening procedures—was serving the interests of\ndentists and not the public. Professional and occupational\nlicensing requirements have often been used in such a\nway.2 But that is not what Parker immunity is about.\nIndeed, the very state program involved in that case was\nunquestionably designed to benefit the regulated entities,\nCalifornia raisin growers.\n   The question before us is not whether such programs\nserve the public interest. The question, instead, is whether\nthis case is controlled by Parker, and the answer to that\nquestion is clear. Under Parker, the Sherman Act (and\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act, see FTC v. Ticor Title\nIns. Co., 504 U. S. 621, 635 (1992)) do not apply to state\nagencies; the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners\nis a state agency; and that is the end of the matter. By\nstraying from this simple path, the Court has not only\ndistorted Parker; it has headed into a morass. Determin-\ning whether a state agency is structured in a way that\nmilitates against regulatory capture is no easy task, and\nthere is reason to fear that today’s decision will spawn\nconfusion. The Court has veered off course, and therefore\nI cannot go along.\n\n\n\n——————\n  1 S.

At\nthat time, this Court and Congress had an understanding\nof the scope of federal and state power that is very differ-\nent from our understanding today. The States were un-\nderstood to possess the exclusive authority to regulate\n“their purely internal affairs.” Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S.\n100, 122 (1890). In exercising their police power in this\narea, the States had long enacted measures, such as price\ncontrols and licensing requirements, that had the effect of\nrestraining trade.3\n   The Sherman Act was enacted pursuant to Congress’\npower to regulate interstate commerce, and in passing the\nAct, Congress wanted to exercise that power “to the ut-\nmost extent.” United States v. South-Eastern Underwrit-\ners Assn., 322 U. S. 533, 558 (1944). But in 1890, the\nunderstanding of the commerce power was far more lim-\nited than it is today. See, e.g., Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S.\n1, 17–18 (1888). As a result, the Act did not pose a threat\nto traditional state regulatory activity.\n   By 1943, when Parker was decided, however, the situa-\ntion had changed dramatically. This Court had held that\nthe commerce power permitted Congress to regulate even\nlocal activity if it “exerts a substantial economic effect on\ninterstate commerce.” Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111,\n125 (1942). This meant that Congress could regulate\nmany of the matters that had once been thought to fall\nexclusively within the jurisdiction of the States. The new\ninterpretation of the commerce power brought about an\nexpansion of the reach of the Sherman Act. See Hospital\n\n——————\n  3 See Handler, The Current Attack on the Parker v. Brown State\n\nAction Doctrine, 76 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 4–6 (1976) (collecting cases).\n4         NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v.

S. 738,\n743, n. 2 (1976) (“[D]ecisions by this Court have permitted\nthe reach of the Sherman Act to expand along with ex-\npanding notions of congressional power”). And the ex-\npanded reach of the Sherman Act raised an important\nquestion. The Sherman Act does not expressly exempt\nStates from its scope. Does that mean that the Act applies\nto the States and that it potentially outlaws many tradi-\ntional state regulatory measures? The Court confronted\nthat question in Parker.\n   In Parker, a raisin producer challenged the California\nAgricultural Prorate Act, an agricultural price support\nprogram. The California Act authorized the creation of an\nAgricultural Prorate Advisory Commission (Commission)\nto establish marketing plans for certain agricultural com-\nmodities within the State. 317 U. S., at 346–347. Raisins\nwere among the regulated commodities, and so the Com-\nmission established a marketing program that governed\nmany aspects of raisin sales, including the quality and\nquantity of raisins sold, the timing of sales, and the price\nat which raisins were sold. Id., at 347–348. The Parker\nCourt assumed that this program would have violated “the\nSherman Act if it were organized and made effective solely\nby virtue of a contract, combination or conspiracy of pri-\nvate persons,” and the Court also assumed that Congress\ncould have prohibited a State from creating a program like\nCalifornia’s if it had chosen to do so. Id., at 350. Never-\ntheless, the Court concluded that the California program\ndid not violate the Sherman Act because the Act did not\ncircumscribe state regulatory power. Id., at 351.\n   The Court’s holding in Parker was not based on either\nthe language of the Sherman Act or anything in the legis-\nlative history affirmatively showing that the Act was not\nmeant to apply to the States. Instead, the Court reasoned\nthat “[i]n a dual system of government in which, under the\nConstitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Con-\n                    Cite as: 574 U.

S., at 351. For the Congress that enacted\nthe Sherman Act in 1890, it would have been a truly radi-\ncal and almost certainly futile step to attempt to prevent\nthe States from exercising their traditional regulatory\nauthority, and the Parker Court refused to assume that\nthe Act was meant to have such an effect.\n   When the basis for the Parker state-action doctrine is\nunderstood, the Court’s error in this case is plain. In\n1890, the regulation of the practice of medicine and den-\ntistry was regarded as falling squarely within the States’\nsovereign police power. By that time, many States had\nestablished medical and dental boards, often staffed by\ndoctors or dentists,4 and had given those boards the au-\nthority to confer and revoke licenses.5 This was quintes-\nsential police power legislation, and although state laws\nwere often challenged during that era under the doctrine\nof substantive due process, the licensing of medical profes-\nsionals easily survived such assaults. Just one year before\nthe enactment of the Sherman Act, in Dent v. West Vir-\nginia, 129 U. S. 114, 128 (1889), this Court rejected such a\nchallenge to a state law requiring all physicians to obtain\na certificate from the state board of health attesting to\ntheir qualifications. And in Hawker v. New York, 170\nU. S. 189, 192 (1898), the Court reiterated that a law\n\n——————\n  4 Shrylock 54–55; D. Johnson and H.

S. 189 (1898), the Court cited state\n\nlaws authorizing such boards to refuse or revoke medical licenses. Id.,\nat 191–193, n. 1. See also Douglas v. Noble, 261 U. S. 165, 166 (1923)\n(“In 1893 the legislature of Washington provided that only licensed\npersons should practice dentistry” and “vested the authority to license\nin a board of examiners, consisting of five practicing dentists”).\n6         NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC \n\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\nspecifying the qualifications to practice medicine was\nclearly a proper exercise of the police power. Thus, the\nNorth Carolina statutes establishing and specifying the\npowers of the State Board of Dental Examiners represent\nprecisely the kind of state regulation that the Parker\nexemption was meant to immunize.\n                               II\n  As noted above, the only question in this case is whether\nthe North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners is really a\nstate agency, and the answer to that question is clearly\nyes.\n   The North Carolina Legislature determined that the\n     practice of dentistry “affect[s] the public health, safety\n     and welfare” of North Carolina’s citizens and that\n     therefore the profession should be “subject to regula-\n     tion and control in the public interest” in order to en-\n     sure “that only qualified persons be permitted to\n     practice dentistry in the State.” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n     §90–22(a) (2013).\n   To further that end, the legislature created the North\n     Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners “as the\n     agency of the State for the regulation of the practice\n     of dentistry in th[e] State.” §90–22(b).\n   The legislature specified the membership of the\n     Board. §90–22(c). It defined the “practice of dentis-\n     try,” §90–29(b), and it set out standards for licensing\n     practitioners, §90–30. The legislature also set out\n     standards under which the Board can initiate disci-\n     plinary proceedings against licensees who engage in\n     certain improper acts. §90–41(a).\n   The legislature empowered the Board to “maintain an\n     action in the name of the State of North Carolina to\n     perpetually enjoin any person from . . . unlawfully\n     practicing dentistry.” §90–40.1(a). It authorized the\n     Board to conduct investigations and to hire legal\n                 Cite as: 574 U.

It has required that any such rules be in-\n     cluded in the Board’s annual report, which the Board\n     must file with the North Carolina secretary of state,\n     the state attorney general, and the legislature’s Joint\n     Regulatory Reform Committee. §93B–2. And if the\n     Board fails to file the required report, state law de-\n     mands that it be automatically suspended until it\n     does so. Ibid.\n   As this regulatory regime demonstrates, North Caro-\nlina’s Board of Dental Examiners is unmistakably a state\nagency created by the state legislature to serve a pre-\nscribed regulatory purpose and to do so using the State’s\npower in cooperation with other arms of state government.\n   The Board is not a private or “nonsovereign” entity that\nthe State of North Carolina has attempted to immunize\nfrom federal antitrust scrutiny. Parker made it clear that\na State may not “ ‘give immunity to those who violate the\nSherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by de-\nclaring that their action is lawful.’ ” Ante, at 7 (quoting\nParker, 317 U. S., at 351). When the Parker Court disap-\nproved of any such attempt, it cited Northern Securities\nCo. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197 (1904), to show what it\nhad in mind. In that case, the Court held that a State’s\nact of chartering a corporation did not shield the corpora-\ntion’s monopolizing activities from federal antitrust law.\nId., at 344–345. Nothing similar is involved here. North\nCarolina did not authorize a private entity to enter into an\nanticompetitive arrangement; rather, North Carolina\ncreated a state agency and gave that agency the power to\nregulate a particular subject affecting public health and\n8           NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                     EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsafety.\n   Nothing in Parker supports the type of inquiry that the\nCourt now prescribes. The Court crafts a test under which\nstate agencies that are “controlled by active market partic-\nipants,” ante, at 12, must demonstrate active state super-\nvision in order to be immune from federal antitrust law.\nThe Court thus treats these state agencies like private\nentities. But in Parker, the Court did not examine the\nstructure of the California program to determine if it had\nbeen captured by private interests. If the Court had done\nso, the case would certainly have come out differently,\nbecause California conditioned its regulatory measures on\nthe participation and approval of market actors in the\nrelevant industry.\n   Establishing a prorate marketing plan under Califor-\nnia’s law first required the petition of at least 10 producers\nof the particular commodity. Parker, 317 U. S., at 346. If\nthe Commission then agreed that a marketing plan was\nwarranted, the Commission would “select a program\ncommittee from among nominees chosen by the qualified\nproducers.” Ibid. (emphasis added). That committee\nwould then formulate the proration marketing program,\nwhich the Commission could modify or approve. But even\nafter Commission approval, the program became law (and\nthen, automatically) only if it gained the approval of 65\npercent of the relevant producers, representing at least 51\npercent of the acreage of the regulated crop. Id., at 347.\nThis scheme gave decisive power to market participants.\nBut despite these aspects of the California program, Par-\nker held that California was acting as a “sovereign” when\nit “adopt[ed] and enforc[ed] the prorate program.” Id., at\n352. This reasoning is irreconcilable with the Court’s\ntoday.\n                             III\n    The Court goes astray because it forgets the origin of the\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nParker doctrine and is misdirected by subsequent cases\nthat extended that doctrine (in certain circumstances) to\nprivate entities. The Court requires the North Carolina\nBoard to satisfy the two-part test set out in California\nRetail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445\nU. S. 97 (1980), but the party claiming Parker immunity in\nthat case was not a state agency but a private trade asso-\nciation. Such an entity is entitled to Parker immunity,\nMidcal held, only if the anticompetitive conduct at issue\nwas both “ ‘clearly articulated’ ” and “ ‘actively supervised\nby the State itself.’ ” 445 U. S., at 105. Those require-\nments are needed where a State authorizes private parties\nto engage in anticompetitive conduct. They serve to iden-\ntify those situations in which conduct by private parties\ncan be regarded as the conduct of a State. But when the\nconduct in question is the conduct of a state agency, no\nsuch inquiry is required.\n   This case falls into the latter category, and therefore\nMidcal is inapposite. The North Carolina Board is not a\nprivate trade association. It is a state agency, created and\nempowered by the State to regulate an industry affecting\npublic health. It would not exist if the State had not\ncreated it. And for purposes of Parker, its membership is\nirrelevant; what matters is that it is part of the govern-\nment of the sovereign State of North Carolina.\n   Our decision in Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34 (1985),\nwhich involved Sherman Act claims against a municipal-\nity, not a State agency, is similarly inapplicable. In Hal-\nlie, the plaintiff argued that the two-pronged Midcal test\nshould be applied, but the Court disagreed. The Court\nacknowledged that municipalities “are not themselves\nsovereign.” 471 U. S., at 38. But recognizing that a munic-\nipality is “an arm of the State,” id., at 45, the Court held\nthat a municipality should be required to satisfy only the\nfirst prong of the Midcal test (requiring a clearly articu-\nlated state policy), 471 U. S., at 46. That municipalities\n10        NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD. OF DENTAL\n                   EXAMINERS v. FTC\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nare not sovereign was critical to our analysis in Hallie,\nand thus that decision has no application in a case, like\nthis one, involving a state agency.\n   Here, however, the Court not only disregards the North\nCarolina Board’s status as a full-fledged state agency; it\ntreats the Board less favorably than a municipality. This\nis puzzling. States are sovereign, Northern Ins. Co. of\nN. Y. v. Chatham County, 547 U. S. 189, 193 (2006), and\nCalifornia’s sovereignty provided the foundation for the\ndecision in Parker, supra, at 352. Municipalities are not\nsovereign. Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 466\n(2003). And for this reason, federal law often treats mu-\nnicipalities differently from States. Compare Will v. Mich-\nigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 71 (1989)\n(“[N]either a State nor its officials acting it their official\ncapacities are ‘persons’ under [42 U. S. C.] §1983”), with\nMonell v. City Dept. of Social Servs., New York, 436 U. S.\n658, 694 (1978) (municipalities liable under §1983 where\n“execution of a government’s policy or custom . . . inflicts\nthe injury”).\n   The Court recognizes that municipalities, although not\nsovereign, nevertheless benefit from a more lenient stand-\nard for state-action immunity than private entities. Yet\nunder the Court’s approach, the North Carolina Board of\nDental Examiners, a full-fledged state agency, is treated\nlike a private actor and must demonstrate that the State\nactively supervises its actions.\n   The Court’s analysis seems to be predicated on an as-\nsessment of the varying degrees to which a municipality\nand a state agency like the North Carolina Board are\nlikely to be captured by private interests. But until today,\nParker immunity was never conditioned on the proper use\nof state regulatory authority. On the contrary, in Colum-\nbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U. S. 365\n(1991), we refused to recognize an exception to Parker for\ncases in which it was shown that the defendants had\n                  Cite as: 574 U.

The\nSherman Act, we said, is not an anticorruption or good-\ngovernment statute. 499 U. S., at 398. We were unwilling\nin Omni to rewrite Parker in order to reach the allegedly\nabusive behavior of city officials. 499 U. S., at 374–379.\nBut that is essentially what the Court has done here.\n                              III\n   Not only is the Court’s decision inconsistent with the\nunderlying theory of Parker; it will create practical prob-\nlems and is likely to have far-reaching effects on the\nStates’ regulation of professions. As previously noted,\nstate medical and dental boards have been staffed by\npractitioners since they were first created, and there are\nobvious advantages to this approach. It is reasonable for\nStates to decide that the individuals best able to regulate\ntechnical professions are practitioners with expertise in\nthose very professions. Staffing the State Board of Dental\nExaminers with certified public accountants would cer-\ntainly lessen the risk of actions that place the well-being of\ndentists over those of the public, but this would also com-\npromise the State’s interest in sensibly regulating a tech-\nnical profession in which lay people have little expertise.\n   As a result of today’s decision, States may find it neces-\nsary to change the composition of medical, dental, and\nother boards, but it is not clear what sort of changes are\nneeded to satisfy the test that the Court now adopts. The\nCourt faults the structure of the North Carolina Board\nbecause “active market participants” constitute “a control-\nling number of [the] decisionmakers,” ante, at 14, but this\ntest raises many questions.\n   What is a “controlling number”? Is it a majority? And if\nso, why does the Court eschew that term? Or does the\nCourt mean to leave open the possibility that something\nless than a majority might suffice in particular circum-\n12          NORTH CAROLINA STATE BD.

Suppose that active market participants consti-\ntute a voting bloc that is generally able to get its way?\nHow about an obstructionist minority or an agency chair\nempowered to set the agenda or veto regulations?\n   Who is an “active market participant”? If Board mem-\nbers withdraw from practice during a short term of service\nbut typically return to practice when their terms end, does\nthat mean that they are not active market participants\nduring their period of service?\n   What is the scope of the market in which a member may\nnot participate while serving on the board? Must the\nmarket be relevant to the particular regulation being\nchallenged or merely to the jurisdiction of the entire agency?\nWould the result in the present case be different if a\nmajority of the Board members, though practicing den-\ntists, did not provide teeth whitening services? What if\nthey were orthodontists, periodontists, and the like? And\nhow much participation makes a person “active” in the\nmarket?\n   The answers to these questions are not obvious, but the\nStates must predict the answers in order to make in-\nformed choices about how to constitute their agencies.\n   I suppose that all this will be worked out by the lower\ncourts and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), but the\nCourt’s approach raises a more fundamental question, and\nthat is why the Court’s inquiry should stop with an exam-\nination of the structure of a state licensing board. When\nthe Court asks whether market participants control the\nNorth Carolina Board, the Court in essence is asking\nwhether this regulatory body has been captured by the\nentities that it is supposed to regulate. Regulatory cap-\nture can occur in many ways.6 So why ask only whether\n——————\n  6 See,\n       e.g., R. Noll, Reforming Regulation 40–43, 46 (1971); J.
