Argued December 1, 2014—Decided March 9, 2015*\nThe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) establishes the procedures\n  federal administrative agencies use for “rule making,” defined as the\n  process of “formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.” 5 U. S. C.\n  §551(5). The APA distinguishes between two types of rules: So-called\n  “legislative rules” are issued through notice-and-comment rulemak-\n  ing, see §§553(b), (c), and have the “force and effect of law,” Chrysler\n  Corp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281, 302–303. “Interpretive rules,” by con-\n  trast, are “issued . . . to advise the public of the agency’s construction\n  of the statutes and rules which it administers,” Shalala v.

S. 87, 99, do not require notice-and-\n  comment rulemaking, and “do not have the force and effect of law,”\n  ibid.\n     In 1999 and 2001, the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Divi-\n  sion issued letters opining that mortgage-loan officers do not qualify\n  for the administrative exemption to overtime pay requirements under\n  the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. In 2004, the Department is-\n  sued new regulations regarding the exemption. Respondent Mort-\n  gage Bankers Association (MBA) requested a new interpretation of\n  the revised regulations as they applied to mortgage-loan officers, and\n  in 2006, the Wage and Hour Division issued an opinion letter finding\n  that mortgage-loan officers fell within the administrative exemption\n  under the 2004 regulations. In 2010, the Department again altered\n  its interpretation of the administrative exemption. Without notice or\n  an opportunity for comment, the Department withdrew the 2006\n——————\n  * Together with No. 13–1052, Nickols et al. v.

C. Circuit’s\n    decision in Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. D. C. Arena L. P., 117 F. 3d\n    579. The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine holds that an agency must use\n    the APA’s notice-and-comment procedures when it wishes to issue a\n    new interpretation of a regulation that deviates significantly from a\n    previously adopted interpretation. The District Court granted sum-\n    mary judgment to the Department, but the D. C. Circuit applied Par-\n    alyzed Veterans and reversed.\nHeld: The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine is contrary to the clear text of\n the APA’s rulemaking provisions and improperly imposes on agencies\n an obligation beyond the APA’s maximum procedural requirements.\n Pp. 6–14.\n      (a) The APA’s categorical exemption of interpretive rules from\n the notice-and-comment process is fatal to the Paralyzed Veterans\n doctrine. The D. C. Circuit’s reading of the APA conflates the differ-\n ing purposes of §§1 and 4 of the Act. Section 1 requires agencies to\n use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they\n used to issue the rule, see 5 U. S. C. §551(5), but it does not say what\n procedures an agency must use when it engages in rulemaking. That\n is the purpose of §4. And §4 specifically exempts interpretive rules\n from notice-and-comment requirements. Because an agency is not\n required to use notice-and-comment procedures to issue an initial in-\n terpretive rule, it is also not required to use those procedures to\n amend or repeal that rule. Pp. 7–8.\n      (b) This straightforward reading of the APA harmonizes with\n longstanding principles of this Court’s administrative law jurispru-\n dence, which has consistently held that the APA “sets forth the full\n extent of judicial authority to review executive agency action for pro-\n cedural correctness,” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S.\n 502, 513. The APA’s rulemaking provisions are no exception: §4 es-\n tablishes “the maximum procedural requirements” that courts may\n impose upon agencies engaged in rulemaking. Vermont Yankee Nu-\n clear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435\n U. S. 519, 524. By mandating notice-and-comment procedures when\n an agency changes its interpretation of one of the regulations it en-\n forces, Paralyzed Veterans creates a judge-made procedural right that\n is inconsistent with Congress’ standards. Pp. 8–9.\n      (c) MBA’s reasons for upholding the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine\n are unpersuasive. Pp. 9–14.\n         (1) MBA asserts that an agency interpretation of a regulation\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  that significantly alters the agency’s prior interpretation effectively\n  amends the underlying regulation. That assertion conflicts with the\n  ordinary meaning of the words “amend” and “interpret,” and it is im-\n  possible to reconcile with the longstanding recognition that interpre-\n  tive rules do not have the force and effect of law. MBA’s theory is\n  particularly odd in light of the limitations of the Paralyzed Veterans\n  doctrine, which applies only when an agency has previously adopted\n  an interpretation of its regulation. MBA fails to explain why its ar-\n  gument regarding revised interpretations should not also extend to\n  the agency’s first interpretation. Christensen v. Harris County, 529\n  U. S. 576, and Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S. 87,\n  distinguished. Pp. 9–12.\n          (2) MBA also contends that the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine re-\n  inforces the APA’s goal of procedural fairness. But the APA already\n  provides recourse to regulated entities from agency decisions that\n  skirt notice-and-comment provisions by placing a variety of con-\n  straints on agency decisionmaking, e.g., the arbitrary and capricious\n  standard. In addition, Congress may include safe-harbor provisions\n  in legislation to shelter regulated entities from liability when they re-\n  ly on previous agency interpretations. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §§259(a),\n  (b)(1). Pp. 12–13.\n          (3) MBA has waived its argument that the 2010 Administra-\n  tor’s Interpretation should be classified as a legislative rule. From\n  the beginning, this suit has been litigated on the understanding that\n  the Administrator’s Interpretation is an interpretive rule. Neither\n  the District Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed this argument\n  below, and MBA did not raise it here in opposing certiorari.

See 5 U. S. C. §553(b)(A). The United States Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has never-\ntheless held, in a line of cases beginning with Paralyzed\nVeterans of Am. v. D. C. Arena L. P., 117 F. 3d 579 (1997),\nthat an agency must use the APA’s notice-and-comment\nprocedures when it wishes to issue a new interpretation of\na regulation that deviates significantly from one the agency\nhas previously adopted. The question in these cases is\nwhether the rule announced in Paralyzed Veterans is\nconsistent with the APA. We hold that it is not.\n2           PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n                              A\n   The APA establishes the procedures federal administra-\ntive agencies use for “rule making,” defined as the process\nof “formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.” §551(5).\n“Rule,” in turn, is defined broadly to include “statement[s]\nof general or particular applicability and future effect”\nthat are designed to “implement, interpret, or prescribe\nlaw or policy.” §551(4).\n   Section 4 of the APA, 5 U. S. C. §553, prescribes a three-\nstep procedure for so-called “notice-and-comment rulemak-\ning.” First, the agency must issue a “[g]eneral notice of\nproposed rule making,” ordinarily by publication in the\nFederal Register. §553(b). Second, if “notice [is] re-\nquired,” the agency must “give interested persons an\nopportunity to participate in the rule making through\nsubmission of written data, views, or arguments.” §553(c).\nAn agency must consider and respond to significant com-\nments received during the period for public comment. See\nCitizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S.\n402, 416 (1971); Thompson v. Clark, 741 F. 2d 401, 408\n(CADC 1984). Third, when the agency promulgates the\nfinal rule, it must include in the rule’s text “a concise\ngeneral statement of [its] basis and purpose.” §553(c).\nRules issued through the notice-and-comment process are\noften referred to as “legislative rules” because they have\nthe “force and effect of law.” Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,\n441 U. S. 281, 302–303 (1979) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Not all “rules” must be issued through the notice-and-\ncomment process. Section 4(b)(A) of the APA provides\nthat, unless another statute states otherwise, the notice-\nand-comment requirement “does not apply” to “interpreta-\ntive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency\norganization, procedure, or practice.”           5 U. S. C.\n§553(b)(A). The term “interpretative rule,” or “interpre-\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntive rule,”1 is not further defined by the APA, and its\nprecise meaning is the source of much scholarly and judi-\ncial debate. See generally Pierce, Distinguishing Legisla-\ntive Rules From Interpretative Rules, 52 Admin. L. Rev.\n547 (2000); Manning, Nonlegislative Rules, 72 Geo. Wash.\nL. Rev. 893 (2004). We need not, and do not, wade into\nthat debate here. For our purposes, it suffices to say that\nthe critical feature of interpretive rules is that they are\n“issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency’s\nconstruction of the statutes and rules which it adminis-\nters.” Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S.\n87, 99 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nabsence of a notice-and-comment obligation makes the\nprocess of issuing interpretive rules comparatively easier\nfor agencies than issuing legislative rules. But that con-\nvenience comes at a price: Interpretive rules “do not have\nthe force and effect of law and are not accorded that\nweight in the adjudicatory process.” Ibid.\n                              B\n   These cases began as a dispute over efforts by the De-\npartment of Labor to determine whether mortgage-loan\nofficers are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act of\n1938 (FLSA), 52 Stat. 1060, as amended, 29 U. S. C. §201\net seq. The FLSA “establishe[s] a minimum wage and\novertime compensation for each hour worked in excess of\n40 hours in each workweek” for many employees. Integ-\nrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Busk, 574 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 3). Certain classes of employees, how-\never, are exempt from these provisions. Among these\nexempt individuals are those “employed in a bona fide\nexecutive, administrative, or professional capacity . . . or\nin the capacity of outside salesman . . . .” §213(a)(1). The\n\n——————\n  1 The latter is the more common phrasing today, and the one we use\n\nthroughout this opinion.\n4          PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nexemption for such employees is known as the “adminis-\ntrative” exemption.\n   The FLSA grants the Secretary of Labor authority to\n“defin[e]” and “delimi[t]” the categories of exempt admin-\nistrative employees. Ibid. The Secretary’s current regu-\nlations regarding the administrative exemption were\npromulgated in 2004 through a notice-and-comment\nrulemaking. As relevant here, the 2004 regulations dif-\nfered from the previous regulations in that they contained\na new section providing several examples of exempt ad-\nministrative employees. See 29 CFR §541.203. One of the\nexamples is “[e]mployees in the financial services indus-\ntry,” who, depending on the nature of their day-to-day\nwork, “generally meet the duties requirements for the\nadministrative exception.” §541.203(b). The financial\nservices example ends with a caveat, noting that “an\nemployee whose primary duty is selling financial products\ndoes not qualify for the administrative exemption.” Ibid.\n   In 1999 and again in 2001, the Department’s Wage and\nHour Division issued letters opining that mortgage-loan\nofficers do not qualify for the administrative exemption.\nSee Opinion Letter, Loan Officers/Exempt Status, 6A\nLRR, Wages and Hours Manual 99:8351 (Feb. 16, 2001);\nOpinion Letter, Mortgage Loan Officers/Exempt Status,\nid., at 99:8249. (May 17, 1999). In other words, the De-\npartment concluded that the FLSA’s minimum wage and\nmaximum hour requirements applied to mortgage-loan\nofficers. When the Department promulgated its current\nFLSA regulations in 2004, respondent Mortgage Bankers\nAssociation (MBA), a national trade association represent-\ning real estate finance companies, requested a new opinion\ninterpreting the revised regulations. In 2006, the De-\npartment issued an opinion letter finding that mortgage-\nloan officers fell within the administrative exemption\nunder the 2004 regulations. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 13–1041, pp. 70a–84a. Four years later, however, the\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWage and Hour Division again altered its interpretation of\nthe FLSA’s administrative exemption as it applied to\nmortgage-loan officers. Id., at 49a–69a. Reviewing the\nprovisions of the 2004 regulations and judicial decisions\naddressing the administrative exemption, the Depart-\nment’s 2010 Administrator’s Interpretation concluded that\nmortgage-loan officers “have a primary duty of making\nsales for their employers, and, therefore, do not qualify”\nfor the administrative exemption. Id., at 49a, 69a. The\nDepartment accordingly withdrew its 2006 opinion letter,\nwhich it now viewed as relying on “misleading assump-\ntion[s] and selective and narrow analysis” of the exemp-\ntion example in §541.203(b). Id., at 68a. Like the 1999,\n2001, and 2006 opinion letters, the 2010 Administrator’s\nInterpretation was issued without notice or an opportunity\nfor comment.\n                             C\n  MBA filed a complaint in Federal District Court chal-\nlenging the Administrator’s Interpretation. MBA con-\ntended that the document was inconsistent with the 2004\nregulation it purported to interpret, and thus arbitrary\nand capricious in violation of §10 of the APA, 5 U. S. C.\n§706. More pertinent to this case, MBA also argued that\nthe Administrator’s Interpretation was procedurally in-\nvalid in light of the D. C. Circuit’s decision in Paralyzed\nVeterans, 117 F. 3d 579. Under the Paralyzed Veterans\ndoctrine, if “an agency has given its regulation a definitive\ninterpretation, and later significantly revises that inter-\npretation, the agency has in effect amended its rule, some-\nthing it may not accomplish” under the APA “without\nnotice and comment.” Alaska Professional Hunters Assn.,\nInc. v. FAA, 177 F. 3d 1030, 1034 (CADC 1999). Three\nformer mortgage-loan officers—Beverly Buck, Ryan Henry,\nand Jerome Nickols—subsequently intervened in the\n6             PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncase to defend the Administrator’s Interpretation.2\n   The District Court granted summary judgment to the\nDepartment.      Mortgage Bankers Assn. v. Solis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (DC 2012). Though it accepted the par-\nties’ characterization of the Administrator’s Interpretation\nas an interpretive rule, id., at 203, n. 7, the District Court\ndetermined that the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine was\ninapplicable because MBA had failed to establish its reli-\nance on the contrary interpretation expressed in the De-\npartment’s 2006 opinion letter. The Administrator’s In-\nterpretation, the District Court further determined, was\nfully supported by the text of the 2004 FLSA regulations.\nThe court accordingly held that the 2010 interpretation\nwas not arbitrary or capricious.3\n   The D. C. Circuit reversed. Mortgage Bankers Assn. v.\nHarris, 720 F. 3d 966 (2013). Bound to the rule of Para-\nlyzed Veterans by precedent, the Court of Appeals rejected\nthe Government’s call to abandon the doctrine. 720 F. 3d.,\nat 967, n. 1. In the court’s view, “[t]he only question”\nproperly before it was whether the District Court had\nerred in requiring MBA to prove that it relied on the\nDepartment’s prior interpretation. Id., at 967. Explaining\nthat reliance was not a required element of the Paralyzed\nVeterans doctrine, and noting the Department’s concession\nthat a prior, conflicting interpretation of the 2004 regula-\ntions existed, the D. C. Circuit concluded that the 2010\nAdministrator’s Interpretation had to be vacated.\n   We granted certiorari, 573 U. S. __ (2014), and now\nreverse.\n                            II\n    The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine is contrary to the clear\n——————\n    2 Buck,\n         Henry, and Nickols are petitioners in No. 13–1052 and re-\nspondents in No. 13–1041.\n  3 MBA did not challenge this aspect of the District Court’s decision on\n\nappeal.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntext of the APA’s rulemaking provisions, and it improperly\nimposes on agencies an obligation beyond the “maximum\nprocedural requirements” specified in the APA, Vermont\nYankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, 524 (1978).\n                              A\n  The text of the APA answers the question presented.\nSection 4 of the APA provides that “notice of proposed rule\nmaking shall be published in the Federal Register.” 5\nU. S. C. §553(b). When such notice is required by the\nAPA, “the agency shall give interested persons an oppor-\ntunity to participate in the rule making.” §553(c). But §4\nfurther states that unless “notice or hearing is required by\nstatute,” the Act’s notice-and-comment requirement “does\nnot apply . . . to interpretative rules.” §553(b)(A). This\nexemption of interpretive rules from the notice-and-\ncomment process is categorical, and it is fatal to the rule\nannounced in Paralyzed Veterans.\n  Rather than examining the exemption for interpretive\nrules contained in §4(b)(A) of the APA, the D. C. Circuit in\nParalyzed Veterans focused its attention on §1 of the Act.\nThat section defines “rule making” to include not only the\ninitial issuance of new rules, but also “repeal[s]” or\n“amend[ments]” of existing rules. See §551(5). Because\nnotice-and-comment requirements may apply even to\nthese later agency actions, the court reasoned, “allow[ing]\nan agency to make a fundamental change in its interpre-\ntation of a substantive regulation without notice and\ncomment” would undermine the APA’s procedural frame-\nwork. 117 F. 3d, at 586.\n  This reading of the APA conflates the differing purposes\nof §§1 and 4 of the Act. Section 1 defines what a rule-\nmaking is. It does not, however, say what procedures an\nagency must use when it engages in rulemaking. That is\nthe purpose of §4. And §4 specifically exempts interpretive\n8           PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrules from the notice-and-comment requirements that\napply to legislative rules. So, the D. C. Circuit correctly\nread §1 of the APA to mandate that agencies use the same\nprocedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used\nto issue the rule in the first instance. See FCC v. Fox\nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502, 515 (2009) (the\nAPA “make[s] no distinction . . . between initial agency\naction and subsequent agency action undoing or revising\nthat action”). Where the court went wrong was in failing\nto apply that accurate understanding of §1 to the exemp-\ntion for interpretive rules contained in §4: Because an\nagency is not required to use notice-and-comment proce-\ndures to issue an initial interpretive rule, it is also not\nrequired to use those procedures when it amends or re-\npeals that interpretive rule.\n                              B\n  The straightforward reading of the APA we now adopt\nharmonizes with longstanding principles of our adminis-\ntrative law jurisprudence. Time and again, we have reit-\nerated that the APA “sets forth the full extent of judicial\nauthority to review executive agency action for procedural\ncorrectness.” Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S., at\n513. Beyond the APA’s minimum requirements, courts\nlack authority “to impose upon [an] agency its own notion\nof which procedures are ‘best’ or most likely to further\nsome vague, undefined public good.” Vermont Yankee, 435\nU. S., at 549. To do otherwise would violate “the very\nbasic tenet of administrative law that agencies should be\nfree to fashion their own rules of procedure.” Id., at 544.\n   These foundational principles apply with equal force to\nthe APA’s procedures for rulemaking. We explained in\nVermont Yankee that §4 of the Act “established the maxi-\nmum procedural requirements which Congress was willing\nto have the courts impose upon agencies in conducting\nrulemaking procedures.” Id., at 524. “Agencies are free to\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngrant additional procedural rights in the exercise of their\ndiscretion, but reviewing courts are generally not free to\nimpose them if the agencies have not chosen to grant\nthem.” Ibid.\n   The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine creates just such a\njudge-made procedural right: the right to notice and an\nopportunity to comment when an agency changes its\ninterpretation of one of the regulations it enforces. That\nrequirement may be wise policy. Or it may not. Regard-\nless, imposing such an obligation is the responsibility of\nCongress or the administrative agencies, not the courts.\nWe trust that Congress weighed the costs and benefits of\nplacing more rigorous procedural restrictions on the issu-\nance of interpretive rules. See id., at 523 (when Congress\nenacted the APA, it “settled long-continued and hard-\nfought contentions, and enact[ed] a formula upon which\nopposing social and political forces have come to rest”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). In the end, Congress\ndecided to adopt standards that permit agencies to prom-\nulgate freely such rules—whether or not they are con-\nsistent with earlier interpretations. That the D. C. Circuit\nwould have struck the balance differently does not permit\nthat court or this one to overturn Congress’ contrary\njudgment. Cf. Law v. Siegel, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\nop., at 11).\n                           III\n  MBA offers several reasons why the Paralyzed Veterans\ndoctrine should be upheld. They are not persuasive.\n                              A\n   MBA begins its defense of the Paralyzed Veterans doc-\ntrine by attempting to bolster the D. C. Circuit’s reading of\nthe APA. “Paralyzed Veterans,” MBA contends, “simply\nacknowledges the reality that where an agency significantly\nalters a prior, definitive interpretation of a regulation, it\n10            PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhas effectively amended the regulation itself,” something\nthat under the APA requires use of notice-and-comment\nprocedures. Brief for Respondent 20–21.\n   The act of “amending,” however, in both ordinary par-\nlance and legal usage, has its own meaning separate and\napart from the act of “interpreting.” Compare Black’s Law\nDictionary 98 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “amend” as “[t]o\nchange the wording of ” or “formally alter . . . by striking\nout, inserting, or substituting words”), with id., at 943\n(defining “interpret” as “[t]o ascertain the meaning and\nsignificance of thoughts expressed in words”). One would\nnot normally say that a court “amends” a statute when it\ninterprets its text. So too can an agency “interpret” a\nregulation without “effectively amend[ing]” the underlying\nsource of law. MBA does not explain how, precisely, an\ninterpretive rule changes the regulation it interprets, and\nits assertion is impossible to reconcile with the longstand-\ning recognition that interpretive rules do not have the\nforce and effect of law. See Chrysler Corp., 441 U. S., at\n302, n. 31 (citing Attorney General’s Manual on the Ad-\nministrative Procedure Act 30, n. 3 (1947)); Skidmore v.\nSwift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944).\n   MBA’s “interpretation-as-amendment” theory is particu-\nlarly odd in light of the limitations of the Paralyzed Veter-\nans doctrine. Recall that the rule of Paralyzed Veterans\napplies only when an agency has previously adopted an\ninterpretation of its regulation. Yet in that initial inter-\npretation as much as all that come after, the agency is\ngiving a definite meaning to an ambiguous text—the very\nact MBA insists requires notice and comment. MBA is\nunable to say why its arguments regarding revised inter-\npretations should not also extend to the agency’s first\ninterpretation.4\n——————\n  4 MBA alternatively suggests that interpretive rules have the force of\n\nlaw because an agency’s interpretation of its own regulations may be\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Next, MBA argues that the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine\nis more consistent with this Court’s “functional” approach\nto interpreting the APA. Relying on Christensen v. Harris\nCounty, 529 U. S. 576 (2000), and Shalala v. Guernsey\nMemorial Hospital, 514 U. S. 87, MBA contends that we\nhave already recognized that an agency may not “avoid\nnotice-and-comment procedures by cloaking its actions in\nthe mantle of mere ‘interpretation.’ ” Brief for Respondent\n23–24.\n   Neither of the cases MBA cites supports its argument.\nOur decision in Christensen did not address a change in\nagency interpretation. Instead, we there refused to give\ndeference to an agency’s interpretation of an unambiguous\nregulation, observing that to defer in such a case would\nallow the agency “to create de facto a new regulation.” 529\nU. S., at 588. Put differently, Christensen held that the\nagency interpretation at issue was substantively invalid\nbecause it conflicted with the text of the regulation the\nagency purported to interpret. That holding is irrelevant\nto this suit and to the Paralyzed Veterans rule, which\nassesses whether an agency interpretation is procedurally\ninvalid.\n\n——————\nentitled to deference under Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997), and\nBowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410 (1945). Even in\ncases where an agency’s interpretation receives Auer deference, how-\never, it is the court that ultimately decides whether a given regulation\nmeans what the agency says. Moreover, Auer deference is not an\ninexorable command in all cases. See Christopher v. SmithKline\nBeecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 10) (Auer defer-\nence is inappropriate “when the agency’s interpretation is plainly\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation” or “when there is reason\nto suspect that the agency’s interpretation does not reflect the agency’s\nfair and considered judgment” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nThomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 515 (1994) (“[A]n\nagency’s interpretation of a . . . regulation that conflicts with a prior\ninterpretation is entitled to considerably less deference than a consist-\nently held agency view” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n12         PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n  As for Guernsey, that case is fully consistent with—\nindeed, confirms—what the text of the APA makes plain:\n“Interpretive rules do not require notice and comment.”\n514 U. S., at 99. Sidestepping this inconvenient language,\nMBA instead quotes a portion of the Court’s opinion stat-\ning that “APA rulemaking would still be required if [an\nagency] adopted a new position inconsistent with . . .\nexisting regulations.” Id., at 100. But the statement on\nwhich MBA relies is dictum. Worse, it is dictum taken out\nof context. The “regulations” to which the Court referred\nwere two provisions of the Medicare reimbursement\nscheme. And it is apparent from the Court’s description of\nthese regulations in Part II of the opinion that they were\nlegislative rules, issued through the notice-and-comment\nprocess. See id., at 91–92 (noting that the disputed regu-\nlations were codified in the Code of Federal Regulations).\nRead properly, then, the cited passage from Guernsey\nmerely means that “an agency may only change its inter-\npretation if the revised interpretation is consistent with\nthe underlying regulations.” Brief for Petitioners in No.\n13–1052, p. 44.\n                            B\n  In the main, MBA attempts to justify the Paralyzed\nVeterans doctrine on practical and policy grounds. MBA\ncontends that the doctrine reinforces the APA’s goal of\n“procedural fairness” by preventing agencies from unilat-\nerally and unexpectedly altering their interpretation of\nimportant regulations. Brief for Respondent 16.\n  There may be times when an agency’s decision to issue\nan interpretive rule, rather than a legislative rule, is\ndriven primarily by a desire to skirt notice-and-comment\nprovisions. But regulated entities are not without re-\ncourse in such situations. Quite the opposite. The APA\ncontains a variety of constraints on agency decisionmak-\ning—the arbitrary and capricious standard being among\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe most notable. As we held in Fox Television Stations,\nand underscore again today, the APA requires an agency\nto provide more substantial justification when “its new\npolicy rests upon factual findings that contradict those\nwhich underlay its prior policy; or when its prior policy\nhas engendered serious reliance interests that must be\ntaken into account. It would be arbitrary and capricious\nto ignore such matters.” 556 U. S., at 515 (citation omit-\nted); see also id., at 535 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment).\n   In addition, Congress is aware that agencies sometimes\nalter their views in ways that upset settled reliance inter-\nests. For that reason, Congress sometimes includes in the\nstatutes it drafts safe-harbor provisions that shelter regu-\nlated entities from liability when they act in conformance\nwith previous agency interpretations. The FLSA includes\none such provision: As amended by the Portal-to-Portal\nAct of 1947, 29 U. S. C. §251 et seq., the FLSA provides\nthat “no employer shall be subject to any liability” for\nfailing “to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation”\nif it demonstrates that the “act or omission complained of\nwas in good faith in conformity with and in reliance on\nany written administrative regulation, order, ruling,\napproval, or interpretation” of the Administrator of the\nDepartment’s Wage and Hour Division, even when the\nguidance is later “modified or rescinded.” §§259(a), (b)(1).\nThese safe harbors will often protect parties from liability\nwhen an agency adopts an interpretation that conflicts\nwith its previous position.5\n——————\n   5 The United States acknowledged at argument that even in situa-\n\ntions where a statute does not contain a safe-harbor provision similar\nto the one included in the FLSA, an agency’s ability to pursue enforce-\nment actions against regulated entities for conduct in conformance with\nprior agency interpretations may be limited by principles of retroactiv-\nity. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44–45. We have no occasion to consider how\nsuch principles might apply here.\n14          PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              C\n   MBA changes direction in the second half of its brief,\ncontending that if the Court overturns the Paralyzed\nVeterans rule, the D. C. Circuit’s judgment should none-\ntheless be affirmed. That is so, MBA says, because the\nagency interpretation at issue—the 2010 Administrator’s\nInterpretation—should in fact be classified as a legislative\nrule.\n   We will not address this argument. From the begin-\nning, the parties litigated this suit on the understanding\nthat the Administrator’s Interpretation was—as its name\nsuggests—an interpretive rule. Indeed, if MBA did not\nthink the Administrator’s Interpretation was an interpre-\ntive rule, then its decision to invoke the Paralyzed Veter-\nans doctrine in attacking the rule is passing strange.\nAfter all, Paralyzed Veterans applied only to interpretive\nrules. Consequently, neither the District Court nor the\nD. C. Circuit considered MBA’s current claim that the\nAdministrator’s Interpretation is actually a legislative\nrule. Beyond that, and more important still, MBA’s brief\nin opposition to certiorari did not dispute petitioners’\nassertions—in their framing of the question presented and\nin the substance of their petitions—that the Administra-\ntor’s Interpretation is an interpretive rule. Thus, even\nassuming MBA did not waive the argument below, it has\ndone so in this Court. See this Court’s Rule 15.2; Carcieri\nv. Salazar, 555 U.

The crea-\ntion of that doctrine may have been prompted by an un-\nderstandable concern about the aggrandizement of the\npower of administrative agencies as a result of the com-\nbined effect of (1) the effective delegation to agencies by\nCongress of huge swaths of lawmaking authority, (2) the\nexploitation by agencies of the uncertain boundary be-\ntween legislative and interpretive rules, and (3) this\nCourt’s cases holding that courts must ordinarily defer to\nan agency’s interpretation of its own ambiguous regula-\ntions. See Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S.\n410 (1945). I do not dismiss these concerns, but the Para-\nlyzed Veterans doctrine is not a viable cure for these prob-\n2           PEREZ v.

C. Circuit’s\nParalyzed Veterans holding with the Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act. Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. D. C. Arena L.P.,\n117 F. 3d 579 (CADC 1997). I do not agree, however, with\nthe Court’s portrayal of the result it produces as a vindica-\ntion of the balance Congress struck when it “weighed the\ncosts and benefits of placing more rigorous . . . restrictions\non the issuance of interpretive rules.” Ante, at 9. That\ndepiction is accurate enough if one looks at this case in\nisolation. Considered alongside our law of deference to\nadministrative determinations, however, today’s decision\nproduces a balance between power and procedure quite\ndifferent from the one Congress chose when it enacted the\nAPA.\n   “The [APA] was framed against a background of rapid\nexpansion of the administrative process as a check upon\n2            PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nadministrators whose zeal might otherwise have carried\nthem to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating\ntheir offices.” United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U. S.\n632, 644 (1950). The Act guards against excesses in rule-\nmaking by requiring notice and comment. Before an\nagency makes a rule, it normally must notify the public of\nthe proposal, invite them to comment on its shortcomings,\nconsider and respond to their arguments, and explain its\nfinal decision in a statement of the rule’s basis and pur-\npose. 5 U. S. C. §553(b)–(c); ante, at 2.\n   The APA exempts interpretive rules from these re-\nquirements. §553(b)(A). But this concession to agencies\nwas meant to be more modest in its effects than it is today.\nFor despite exempting interpretive rules from notice and\ncomment, the Act provides that “the reviewing court\nshall . . . interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,\nand determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of\nan agency action.” §706 (emphasis added). The Act thus\ncontemplates that courts, not agencies, will authoritatively\nresolve ambiguities in statutes and regulations. In such\na regime, the exemption for interpretive rules does not add\nmuch to agency power. An agency may use interpretive\nrules to advise the public by explaining its interpretation\nof the law. But an agency may not use interpretive rules\nto bind the public by making law, because it remains the\nresponsibility of the court to decide whether the law\nmeans what the agency says it means.\n   Heedless of the original design of the APA, we have\ndeveloped an elaborate law of deference to agencies’ inter-\npretations of statutes and regulations. Never mentioning\n§706’s directive that the “reviewing court . . . interpret . . .\nstatutory provisions,” we have held that agencies may\nauthoritatively resolve ambiguities in statutes. Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 842–843 (1984). And never mentioning\n§706’s directive that the “reviewing court . . . determine\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency\naction,” we have—relying on a case decided before the\nAPA, Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410\n(1945)—held that agencies may authoritatively resolve\nambiguities in regulations. Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S.\n452, 461 (1997).\n   By supplementing the APA with judge-made doctrines\nof deference, we have revolutionized the import of inter-\npretive rules’ exemption from notice-and-comment rule-\nmaking. Agencies may now use these rules not just to\nadvise the public, but also to bind them. After all, if an\ninterpretive rule gets deference, the people are bound to\nobey it on pain of sanction, no less surely than they are\nbound to obey substantive rules, which are accorded simi-\nlar deference. Interpretive rules that command deference\ndo have the force of law.\n   The Court’s reasons for resisting this obvious point\nwould not withstand a gentle breeze. Even when an agen-\ncy’s interpretation gets deference, the Court argues, “it is\nthe court that ultimately decides whether [the text] means\nwhat the agency says.” Ante, at 10–11, n. 4. That is not\nquite so. So long as the agency does not stray beyond the\nambiguity in the text being interpreted, deference compels\nthe reviewing court to “decide” that the text means what\nthe agency says. The Court continues that “deference is\nnot an inexorable command in all cases,” because (for\nexample) it does not apply to plainly erroneous interpreta-\ntions. Ibid. True, but beside the point. Saying all inter-\npretive rules lack force of law because plainly erroneous\ninterpretations do not bind courts is like saying all sub-\nstantive rules lack force of law because arbitrary and\ncapricious rules do not bind courts. Of course an interpre-\ntive rule must meet certain conditions before it gets defer-\nence—the interpretation must, for instance, be reason-\nable—but once it does so it is every bit as binding as a\nsubstantive rule. So the point stands: By deferring to\n4           PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninterpretive rules, we have allowed agencies to make\nbinding rules unhampered by notice-and-comment\nprocedures.\n    The problem is bad enough, and perhaps insoluble if\nChevron is not to be uprooted, with respect to interpretive\nrules setting forth agency interpretation of statutes. But\nan agency’s interpretation of its own regulations is an-\nother matter. By giving that category of interpretive rules\nAuer deference, we do more than allow the agency to make\nbinding regulations without notice and comment. Because\nthe agency (not Congress) drafts the substantive rules\nthat are the object of those interpretations, giving them\ndeference allows the agency to control the extent of its\nnotice-and-comment-free domain. To expand this domain,\nthe agency need only write substantive rules more\nbroadly and vaguely, leaving plenty of gaps to be filled in\nlater, using interpretive rules unchecked by notice and\ncomment. The APA does not remotely contemplate this\nregime.\n    Still and all, what are we to do about the problem? The\nParalyzed Veterans doctrine is a courageous (indeed,\nbrazen) attempt to limit the mischief by requiring an\ninterpretive rule to go through notice and comment if it\nrevises an earlier definitive interpretation of a regulation.\nThat solution is unlawful for the reasons set forth in the\nCourt’s opinion: It contradicts the APA’s unqualified ex-\nemption of interpretive rules from notice-and-comment\nrulemaking.\n    But I think there is another solution—one unavailable\nto the D. C. Circuit since it involves the overruling of one\nthis Court’s decisions (that being even a greater fault than\nmerely ignoring the APA). As I have described elsewhere,\nthe rule of Chevron, if it did not comport with the APA, at\nleast was in conformity with the long history of judicial\nreview of executive action, where “[s]tatutory ambiguities\n. . . were left to reasonable resolution by the Executive.”\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

I would therefore restore the\nbalance originally struck by the APA with respect to an\nagency’s interpretation of its own regulations, not by\nrewriting the Act in order to make up for Auer, but by\nabandoning Auer and applying the Act as written.

This line of\nprecedents undermines our obligation to provide a judicial\ncheck on the other branches, and it subjects regulated\nparties to precisely the abuses that the Framers sought to\nprevent.\n                               I\n   The doctrine of deference to an agency’s interpretation\nof regulations is usually traced back to this Court’s deci-\nsion in Seminole Rock, supra, which involved the interpre-\ntation of a war-time price control regulation, id., at 411.\nAlong with a general price freeze, the Administrator of the\nOffice of Price Administration had promulgated special-\nized regulations governing the maximum price for differ-\nent commodities. Id., at 413. When the Administrator\nbrought an enforcement action against a manufacturer of\ncrushed stone, the manufacturer challenged the Adminis-\ntrator’s interpretation of his regulations.\n   The lower courts agreed with the manufacturer’s inter-\npretation, id., at 412–413, but this Court reversed. In\nsetting out the approach it would apply to the case, the\nCourt announced—without citation or explanation—that\nan administrative interpretation of an ambiguous regula-\ntion was entitled to “controlling weight”:\n    “Since this involves an interpretation of an adminis-\n    trative regulation a court must necessarily look to the\n    administrative construction of the regulation if the\n    meaning of the words used is in doubt. The intention\n    of Congress or the principles of the Constitution in\n    some situations may be relevant in the first instance\n    in choosing between various constructions. But the\n    ultimate criterion is the administrative interpreta-\n    tion, which becomes of controlling weight unless it is\n    plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.”\n    Id., at 413–414.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    3\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nThe Court then concluded that the rule “clearly” favored\nthe Administrator’s interpretation, rendering this discus-\nsion dictum. Id., at 415–417.\n   From this unsupported rule developed a doctrine of\ndeference that has taken on a life of its own.1 It has been\nbroadly applied to regulations issued by agencies across a\nbroad spectrum of subjects. See, e.g., Robertson v. Methow\nValley Citizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 358–359 (1989)\n(forests); Ehlert v. United States, 402 U. S. 99, 104–105\n(1971) (Selective Service); INS v. Stanisic, 395 U. S. 62, 72\n(1969) (deportation); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U. S. 1, 16–17\n(1965) (oil and gas leases). It has even been applied to an\nagency’s interpretation of another agency’s regulations.\nSee Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc., 501 U. S. 680, 696–\n699 (1991). And, it has been applied to an agency inter-\npretation that was inconsistent with a previous interpre-\ntation of the same regulation. See Long Island Care at\nHome, Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 170–171 (2007). It has\nbeen applied to formal and informal interpretations alike,\nincluding those taken during litigation. See Auer v. Rob-\nbins, 519 U. S. 452, 462 (1997). Its reasoning has also\nbeen extended outside the context of traditional agency\nregulations into the realm of criminal sentencing. See\nStinson v. United States, 508 U. S. 36, 44–45 (1993) (con-\ncluding that the Sentencing Commission’s commentary on\nits Guidelines is analogous to an agency interpretation of\nits own regulations, entitled to Seminole Rock deference).\n   The Court has even applied the doctrine to an agency\ninterpretation of a regulation cast in such vague aspira-\ntional terms as to have no substantive content. See\n——————\n  1 Although the Court has appeared to treat our agency deference\n\nregimes as precedents entitled to stare decisis effect, some scholars\nhave noted that they might instead be classified as interpretive tools.\nSee, e.g., C. Nelson, Statutory Interpretation 701 (2011). Such tools\nmight not be entitled to such effect. Because resolution of that issue is\nnot necessary to my conclusion here, I leave it for another day.\n4             PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nThomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 512–513\n(1994); see also id., at 518 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   On this steady march toward deference, the Court only\nonce expressly declined to apply Seminole Rock deference\non the ground that the agency’s interpretation was plainly\nerroneous.2 In that case, we were faced with the predict-\nable consequence of this line of precedents: An agency\nsought deference to an opinion letter that interpreted a\npermissive regulation as mandatory. See Christensen v.\nHarris County, 529 U. S. 576, 588 (2000). We rejected that\nrequest for deference as an effort, “under the guise of\ninterpreting a regulation, to create de facto a new regula-\ntion.” Ibid. This narrow limit on the broad deference\ngiven the agency interpretations, though sound, could not\nsave a doctrine that was constitutionally infirm from the\nstart. Seminole Rock was constitutionally suspect from\nthe start, and this Court’s repeated extensions of it have\nonly magnified the effects and the attendant concerns.\n\n——————\n   2 The Court has also twice expressly found Seminole Rock deference\n\ninapplicable for other reasons. Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham\nCorp., 567 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (slip op., at 13–14) (“[W]here, as\nhere, an agency’s announcement of its interpretation is preceded by a\nvery lengthy period of conspicuous inaction, the potential for unfair\nsurprise is acute. . . . [W]hatever the general merits of Auer deference,\nit is unwarranted here”); Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 256–257\n(2006) (“In our view Auer and the standard of deference it accords to an\nagency are inapplicable here. . . . The language the Interpretive Rule\naddresses comes from Congress, not the Attorney General, and the near\nequivalence of the statute and regulation belies the Government’s\nargument for Auer deference”).\n   Occasionally, Members of this Court have argued in separate writ-\nings that the Court failed appropriately to apply Seminole Rock defer-\nence, but in none of those cases did the majority opinions of the Court\nexpressly refuse to do so. See Ballard v. Commissioner, 544 U. S. 40\n(2005); Allentown Mack Sales & Service, Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U. S. 359\n(1998); Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs v.

Although this Court has\nrepeatedly invoked the “separation of powers” and “the\nconstitutional system of checks and balances” as core\nprinciples of our constitutional design, essential to the\nprotection of individual liberty, see, e.g., Stern v. Marshall,\n564 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 16–17) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), it has also endorsed a “more\npragmatic, flexible approach” to that design when it has\nseemed more convenient to permit the powers to be mixed,\nsee, e.g., Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433\nU. S. 425, 442 (1977). As the history shows, that approach\nruns the risk of compromising our constitutional\nstructure.\n                              A\n   The Constitution’s particular blend of separated powers\nand checks and balances was informed by centuries of\npolitical thought and experiences. See M. Vile, Constitu-\ntionalism and the Separation of Powers 38, 168–169 (2d\ned. 1998) (Vile). Though the theories of the separation of\npowers and checks and balances have roots in the ancient\nworld, events of the 17th and 18th centuries played a\ncrucial role in their development and informed the men\nwho crafted and ratified the Constitution.\n   Over a century before our War of Independence, the\nEnglish Civil War catapulted the theory of the separation\nof powers to prominence. As political theorists of the day\nwitnessed the conflict between the King and Parliament,\nand the dangers of tyrannical government posed by each,\nthey began to call for a clear division of authority between\nthe two. Id., at 44–45, 48–49. A 1648 work titled The\nRoyalist’s Defence offered perhaps the first extended\naccount of the theory of the separation of powers:\n“[W]hilst the Supreamacy, the Power to Judge the Law,\n6           PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nand Authority to make new Lawes, are kept in severall\nhands, the known Law is preserved, but united, it is van-\nished, instantly thereupon, and Arbytrary and Tyrannicall\npower is introduced.” The Royalist’s Defence 80 (1648)\n(italics in original).\n   John Locke and Baron de Montesquieu endorsed and\nexpanded on this concept. See Vile 63–64. They agreed\nwith the general theory set forth in The Royalist’s De-\nfence, emphasizing the need for a separation of powers to\nprotect individual liberty. J. Locke, Second Treatise of\nCivil Government §§143–144, p. 72 (J. Gough ed. 1947);\nMontesquieu, Spirit of the Laws bk. XI, ch. 6, pp. 151–152\n(O. Piest ed., T. Nugent transl. 1949). But they also advo-\ncated a system of checks and balances to reinforce that\nseparation. Vile 72–73, 102. For instance, they agreed\nthat the executive should have the power to assemble and\ndismiss the legislature and to consent to laws passed by it.\nSee Locke, supra, §§151, 156, at 75, 77–78; Montesquieu,\nSpirit of the Laws, at 157, 159. Montesquieu warned that\n“power should be a check to power” lest the legislature\n“arrogate to itself what authority it pleased . . . [and] soon\ndestroy all the other powers.” Id., at 150, 157.\n   The experience of the States during the period between\nthe War of Independence and the ratification of the Con-\nstitution confirmed the wisdom of combining these theo-\nries. Although many State Constitutions of the time\nincluded language unequivocally endorsing the separation\nof powers, they did not secure that separation with checks\nand balances, Vile 147, and actively placed traditional\nexecutive and judicial functions in the legislature,\nG. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776–\n1787, pp. 155–156 (1969). Under these arrangements,\nstate legislatures arrogated power to themselves and\nbegan to confiscate property, approve the printing of paper\nmoney, and suspend the ordinary means for the recovery\n                    Cite as: 575 U.

Id., at 403–409.3\n   When the Framers met for the Constitutional Conven-\ntion, they understood the need for greater checks and\nbalances to reinforce the separation of powers. As Madi-\nson remarked, “experience has taught us a distrust” of the\nseparation of powers alone as “a sufficient security to each\n[branch] [against] encroachments of the others.” 2 Re-\ncords of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 77 (M. Farrand\nrev. 1966). “[I]t is necessary to introduce such a balance of\npowers and interests, as will guarantee the provisions on\npaper.” Ibid. The Framers thus separated the three main\npowers of Government—legislative, executive, and judi-\ncial—into the three branches created by Articles I, II, and\nIII. But they also created checks and balances to reinforce\nthat separation. For example, they gave Congress specific\nenumerated powers to enact legislation, Art. I, §8, but\ngave the President the power to veto that legislation,\nsubject to congressional override by a supermajority vote,\nArt. I, §7, cls. 2, 3. They gave the President the power to\nappoint principal officers of the United States, but gave\nthe Senate the power to give advice and consent to those\nappointments. Art. II, §2, cl. 2. They gave the House and\nSenate the power to agree to adjourn for more than three\ndays, Art. I, §5, cl. 4, but gave the President the power, “in\nCase of Disagreement between them,” to adjourn the\nCongress “to such Time as he shall think proper.” Art. II,\n§3, cl. 3. During the ratification debates, Madison argued\nthat this structure represented “the great security” for\nliberty in the Constitution. The Federalist No. 51, p. 321\n——————\n   3 The practices of the time can perhaps best be summarized by the\n\nfollowing commentary from a contemporaneous magazine: “[S]o many\nlegal infractions of sacred right—so many public invasions of private\nproperty—so many wanton abuses of legislative powers!” Giles Hickory\n(Noah Webster), Government, The American Magazine, Mar. 1788, p.\n206.\n8           PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison).\n  To the Framers, the separation of powers and checks\nand balances were more than just theories. They were\npractical and real protections for individual liberty in the\nnew Constitution. See Mistretta v. United States, 488\nU. S. 361, 426 (1989) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[The Con-\nstitution] is a prescribed structure, a framework, for the\nconduct of government. In designing that structure, the\nFramers themselves considered how much commingling [of\ngovernmental powers] was, in the generality of things,\nacceptable, and set forth their conclusions in the docu-\nment”).    The Judiciary—no less than the other two\nbranches—has an obligation to guard against deviations\nfrom those principles. The Seminole Rock line of prece-\ndent is one such deviation.\n                             B\n  Seminole Rock raises two related constitutional con-\ncerns. It represents a transfer of judicial power to the\nExecutive Branch, and it amounts to an erosion of the\njudicial obligation to serve as a “check” on the political\nbranches.\n                              1\n  When a party properly brings a case or controversy to\nan Article III court, that court is called upon to exercise\nthe “judicial Power of the United States.” Art. III, §1. For\nthe reasons I explain in this section, the judicial power, as\noriginally understood, requires a court to exercise its\nindependent judgment in interpreting and expounding\nupon the laws.\n  Those who ratified the Constitution knew that legal\ntexts would often contain ambiguities. See generally\nMolot, The Judicial Perspective in the Administrative\nState: Reconciling Modern Doctrines of Deference with the\nJudiciary’s Structural Role, 53 Stan. L. Rev. 1, 20–21, and\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

As\nJames Madison explained, “All new laws, though penned\nwith the greatest technical skill and passed on the fullest\nand most mature deliberation, are considered as more or\nless obscure and equivocal . . . .” The Federalist No. 37,\nat 229.\n   The judicial power was understood to include the power\nto resolve these ambiguities over time. See ibid. Alexan-\nder Hamilton lauded this power, arguing that “[t]he inter-\npretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of\nthe courts.” Id., No. 78, at 467. It is undoubtedly true\nthat the other branches of Government have the authority\nand obligation to interpret the law, but only the judicial\ninterpretation would be considered authoritative in a\njudicial proceeding. Vile 360.\n   Although the Federalists and Anti-Federalists engaged\nin a public debate about this interpretive power, that\ndebate centered on the dangers inherent in the power, not\non its allocation under the Constitution. See, e.g., Letters\nfrom The Federal Farmer XV (Jan. 18, 1788), in 2 The\nComplete Anti-Federalist 315–316 (H. Storing ed. 1981)\n(arguing that the interpretive power made the Judiciary\nthe most dangerous branch). Writing as “Brutus,” one\nleading anti-Federalist argued that judges “w[ould] not\nconfine themselves to any fixed or established rules, but\nw[ould] determine, according to what appears to them, the\nreason and spirit of the constitution.” Essays of Brutus\n(Jan. 31, 1788), in 2 id., at 420. The Federalists rejected\nthese arguments, assuring the public that judges would be\nguided “by strict rules and precedents which serve to\ndefine and point out their duty in every particular case\nthat comes before them.” The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (A.\nHamilton). Those rules included principles of interpreta-\ntion that had been set out by jurists for centuries. See,\ne.g., 2 S. von Pufendorf, De Officio Hominis Et Civis Juxta\n10          PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nLegem Naturalem Libri Duo 83–86 (1682) (F. Moore\ntransl. 1927); see also 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on\nthe Laws of England 59–61 (1765).\n   One of the key elements of the Federalists’ arguments in\nsupport of the allocation of power to make binding inter-\npretations of the law was that Article III judges would\nexercise independent judgment. Although “judicial inde-\npendence” is often discussed in terms of independence\nfrom external threats, the Framers understood the concept\nto also require independence from the “internal threat” of\n“human will.” P. Hamburger, Law and Judicial Duty 507,\n508 (2008); see also The Federalist No. 78, at 465 (A.\nHamilton) (“The judiciary . . . may truly be said to have\nneither FORCE nor WILL but merely judgment . . . ”).\nIndependent judgment required judges to decide cases in\naccordance with the law of the land, not in accordance\nwith pressures placed upon them through either internal\nor external sources. Internal sources might include per-\nsonal biases, while external sources might include pres-\nsure from the political branches, the public, or other\ninterested parties. See Hamburger, supra, at 508–521.\n   The Framers made several key decisions at the Conven-\ntion with these pressures in mind. For example, they\nrejected proposals to include a federal council of revision\nafter several participants at the Convention expressed\nconcern that judicial involvement in such a council would\nfoster internal biases. Rufus King of Maryland, for exam-\nple, asserted that “the Judges ought to be able to expound\nthe law as it should come before them, free from the bias\nof having participated in its formation.” 1 Records of the\nFederal Convention of 1787, at 98. Alexander Hamilton\nrepeated these concerns in The Federalist, arguing that\n“the judges, who are to be interpreters of the law, might\nreceive an improper bias from having given a previous\nopinion in their revisionary capacities” or “be induced to\nembark too far in the political views of [the Executive]”\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfrom too much association with him. The Federalist No.\n73, at 446; see also Hamburger, supra, at 508–512.\n   The Framers also created structural protections in the\nConstitution to free judges from external influences. They\nprovided, for example, that judges should “hold their\nOffices during good Behaviour” and receive “a Compensa-\ntion, which shall not be diminished during their Continu-\nance in Office.” Art. III, §1. Hamilton noted that such\nunequivocal language had been shown necessary by the\nexperience of the States, where similar state constitutional\nprotections for judges had not been “sufficiently definite\nto preclude legislative evasions” of the separation of the\njudicial power. The Federalist No. 79, at 472. Because\n“power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over\nhis will,” he argued that Article III’s structural protections\nwould help ensure that judges fulfilled their constitutional\nrole. Ibid. (emphasis deleted).\n   The Framers made the opposite choice for legislators\nand the Executive. Instead of insulating them from exter-\nnal pressures, the Constitution tied them to those pres-\nsures. It provided for election of Members of the House of\nRepresentatives every two years, Art. I, §2, cl. 1; and\nselection of Members of the Senate every six years, Art. I,\n§3, cl. 1. It also provided for the President to be subject to\nelection every four years. Art. II, §1, cl. 1. “The President\nis [thus] directly dependent on the people, and since there\nis only one President, he is responsible. The people know\nwhom to blame . . . .” See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S.\n654, 729 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). To preserve that\naccountability, we have held that executive officers must\nbe subject to removal by the President to ensure account-\nability within the Executive Branch. See Free Enterprise\nFund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561\nU. S. 477, 495 (2010); see also Morrison, supra, at 709\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.) (“It is not for us to determine, and\nwe have never presumed to determine, how much of the\n12             PEREZ v.

The Constitution prescribes\nthat they all are”).\n   Given these structural distinctions between the branches,\nit is no surprise that judicial interpretations are defini-\ntive in cases and controversies before the courts. Courts\nact as “an intermediate body between the people and the\nlegislature, in order, among other things, to keep the\nlatter within the limits assigned to their authority.” Fed-\neralist No. 78, at 467 (A. Hamilton). The Legislature and\nExecutive may be swayed by popular sentiment to aban-\ndon the strictures of the Constitution or other rules of law.\nBut the Judiciary, insulated from both internal and exter-\nnal sources of bias, is duty bound to exercise independent\njudgment in applying the law.\n   Interpreting agency regulations calls for that exercise of\nindependent judgment. Substantive regulations have the\nforce and effect of law. See, e.g., United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 231–232 (2001).4 Agencies and pri-\n——————\n   4 These cases also raise constitutional questions about the distinction\n\nin administrative law between “substantive” (or “legislative”) and\ninterpretative rules. The United States Court of Appeals for the D. C.\nCircuit has defined a legislative rule as “[a]n agency action that pur-\nports to impose legally binding obligations or prohibitions on regulated\nparties” and an interpretative rule as “[a]n agency action that merely\ninterprets a prior statute or regulation, and does not itself purport to\nimpose new obligations or prohibitions or requirements on regulated\nparties.” National Mining Assn. v. McCarthy, 758 F. 3d 243, 251–252\n(2014). And our precedents make clear that administrative agencies\nmust exercise only executive power in promulgating these rules.\nArlington v. FCC, 569 U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2013) (slip op., at 13, n. 4).\nBut while it is easy to see the promulgation of interpretative rules as\nan “executive” function—executive officials necessarily interpret the\nlaws they enforce—it is difficult to see what authority the President\nhas “to impose legally binding obligations or prohibitions on regulated\nparties.” That definition suggests something much closer to the legisla-\ntive power, which our Constitution does not permit the Executive to\nexercise in this manner. Because these troubling questions are not\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

See, e.g., Christopher v.\nSmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012)\n(slip op., at 6–7) (private party relying on Department of\nLabor regulations); FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,\n567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (agency issuing\nnotices of liability under regulations). Just as it is critical\nfor judges to exercise independent judgment in applying\nstatutes, it is critical for judges to exercise independent\njudgment in determining that a regulation properly covers\nthe conduct of regulated parties. Defining the legal mean-\ning of the regulation is one aspect of that determination.\n   Seminole Rock deference, however, precludes judges\nfrom independently determining that meaning. Rather\nthan judges’ applying recognized tools of interpretation to\ndetermine the best meaning of a regulation, this doctrine\ndemands that courts accord “controlling weight” to the\nagency interpretation of a regulation, subject only to the\nnarrow exception for interpretations that are plainly\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. That defer-\nence amounts to a transfer of the judge’s exercise of inter-\npretive judgment to the agency. See 1 S. Johnson, Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 499 (4th ed. 1773)\n(defining “[d]efer” as “to leave to another’s judgment”).\nBut the agency, as part of the Executive Branch, lacks the\nstructural protections for independent judgment adopted\nby the Framers, including the life tenure and salary pro-\ntections of Article III. Because the agency is thus not\nproperly constituted to exercise the judicial power under\nthe Constitution, the transfer of interpretive judgment\nraises serious separation-of-powers concerns.\n\n\n—————— \n\ndirectly implicated here, I leave them for another case. See Department \n\nof Transportation v. Association of American Railroads, ante, at 19–22\n\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n\n14          PEREZ v.

Unlike the Legislative and Execu-\ntive Branches, each of which possesses several political\nchecks on the other, the Judiciary has one primary check\non the excesses of political branches. That check is the\nenforcement of the rule of law through the exercise of\njudicial power.\n   Judges have long recognized their responsibility to\napply the law, even if they did not conceive of it as a\n“check” on political power.

But\nthe King’s representative, Lord Chancellor Ellesmere,\nresponded that “he would advise the Judges to maintain\nthe power and prerogative of the King” and suggested\nthat, “in cases in which there is no authority and prece-\ndent,” the judiciary should “leave it to the King to order in\nit according to his wisdom.” Ibid. Coke famously re-\nsponded, “[T]he King cannot change any part of the com-\nmon law, nor create any offence by his proclamation,\nwhich was not an offence before, without Parliament.”\nIbid. When James I later attempted to do just that, Coke\ndeclared the proclamations “ ‘utterly against Law and\nreason, and for that void.’ ” Hamburger, supra, at 202.\n   The Framers expected Article III judges to engage in\nsimilar efforts, by applying the law as a “check” on the\nexcesses of both the Legislative and Executive Branches.\nSee, e.g., 3 J. Elliot, Debates in the Several Conventions\non the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 553 (1863) (J.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

They would\ndeclare it void”); see also Vile 174. The Framers “contem-\nplated [the Constitution], as a rule for the government of\ncourts, as well as of the legislature.” Marbury v. Madison,\n1 Cranch 137, 179–180 (1803). Thus, if a case involved a\nconflict between a law and the Constitution, judges would\nhave a duty “to adhere to the latter and disregard the\nformer.” The Federalist No. 78, at 468 (A. Hamilton); see\nalso Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 178. Similarly, if a case in-\nvolved an executive effort to extend a law beyond its\nmeaning, judges would have a duty to adhere to the law\nthat had been properly promulgated under the Constitu-\ntion. Cf. id., at 157–158 (considering the scope of the\nPresident’s constitutional power of appointment). As this\nCourt said long ago, “[T]he particular phraseology of the\nconstitution of the United States confirms and strengthens\nthe principle, supposed to be essential to all written con-\nstitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void;\nand that courts, as well as other departments, are bound\nby that instrument.” Id., at 180.\n   Article III judges cannot opt out of exercising their\ncheck. As we have long recognized, “[t]he Judiciary has a\nresponsibility to decide cases properly before it, even those\nit ‘would gladly avoid.’ ” Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.

S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\nop., at 10). In each case, the Judiciary is called upon to\nexercise its independent judgment and apply the law.\n  But we have not consistently exercised the judicial\ncheck with respect to administrative agencies. Even\nthough regulated parties have repeatedly challenged\nagency interpretations as inconsistent with existing regu-\nlations, we have just as repeatedly declined to exercise\nindependent judgment as to those claims. Instead, we\nhave deferred to the executive agency that both promul-\ngated the regulations and enforced them. Although an\nagency’s interpretation of a regulation might be the best\ninterpretation, it also might not. When courts refuse even\nto decide what the best interpretation is under the law,\nthey abandon the judicial check. That abandonment\npermits precisely the accumulation of governmental pow-\ners that the Framers warned against. See The Federalist\nNo. 47, at 302 (J. Madison).\n                             C\n   This accumulation of governmental powers allows agen-\ncies to change the meaning of regulations at their discre-\ntion and without any advance notice to the parties. It is\nprecisely this problem that the United States Court of\nAppeals for the D. C. Circuit attempted to address by\nrequiring agencies to undertake notice and comment\nprocedures before substantially revising definitive inter-\npretations of regulations. Paralyzed Veterans, supra.\nThough legally erroneous, the Court of Appeals’ reasoning\nwas practically sound. When courts give “controlling\nweight” to an administrative interpretation of a regula-\ntion—instead of to the best interpretation of it—they\neffectively give the interpretation—and not the regula-\ntion—the force and effect of law. To regulated parties, the\nnew interpretation might as well be a new regulation.\n                    Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                17\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   These cases provide a classic example of the problem.\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 establishes federal\nminimum wage and overtime requirements, but exempts\nfrom these requirements “any employee engaged in a bona\nfide executive, administrative, or professional capac-\nity . . . , or in the capacity of outside salesman (as such\nterms are defined and delimited from time to time by\nregulations of the Secretary).” 29 U. S. C. §213(a)(1). The\nDepartment of Labor has accordingly promulgated regula-\ntions providing that “an employee whose primary duty is\nselling financial products does not qualify for the adminis-\ntrative exemption.” 29 CFR §541.203(b) (2015).\n   Unsure whether certain mortgage-loan officers qualified\nas employees whose primary duty is selling financial\nproducts, the Mortgage Bankers Association asked the\nDepartment of Labor for advice. In 2006, the Department\nconcluded that the officers are not employees whose pri-\nmary duty is selling financial products. But in 2010, the\nDepartment reversed course, concluding exactly the oppo-\nsite. If courts accord “controlling weight” to both the 2006\nand 2010 interpretations, the regulated entities are sub-\nject to two opposite legal rules imposed under the same\nregulation.\n   This practice turns on its head the principle that the\nUnited States is “a government of laws, and not of men.”\nMarbury, supra, at 163. Regulations provide notice to\nregulated parties in only a limited sense because their\nmeaning will ultimately be determined by agencies rather\nthan by the “strict rules and precedents” to which Alexan-\nder Hamilton once referred.5\n——————\n  5 The notice problem is exacerbated by agency departures from the\n\nprocedures established for rulemaking in the APA. Although almost all\nrulemaking is today accomplished through informal notice and com-\nment, the APA actually contemplated a much more formal process for\nmost rulemaking. To that end, it provided for elaborate trial-like\nhearings in which proponents of particular rules would introduce\n18            PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                            III\n   Although this Court offered no theoretical justifica-\ntion for Seminole Rock deference when announcing it, sev-\neral justifications have been proposed since. None is\npersuasive.\n                             A\n   Probably the most oft-recited justification for Seminole\nRock deference is that of agency expertise in administer-\ning technical statutory schemes. Under this justification,\ndeference to administrative agencies is necessary when a\n“regulation concerns ‘a complex and highly technical regu-\nlatory program’ in which the identification and classifica-\ntion of relevant ‘criteria necessarily require significant\nexpertise and entail the exercise of judgment grounded in\npolicy concerns.’ ” Thomas Jefferson Univ., 512 U. S., at\n512.\n   This defense of Seminole Rock deference misidentifies\nthe relevant inquiry. The proper question faced by courts\nin interpreting a regulation is not what the best policy\nchoice might be, but what the regulation means. Because\nthis Court has concluded that “substantive agency regula-\ntions have the ‘force and effect of law,’ ” Chrysler Corp. v.\n\n——————\nevidence and bear the burden of proof in support of those proposed\nrules. See 5 U. S. C. §556.\n  Today, however, formal rulemaking is the Yeti of administrative law.\nThere are isolated sightings of it in the ratemaking context, but else-\nwhere it proves elusive. It is somewhat ironic for the Court so ada-\nmantly to insist that agencies be subject to no greater procedures than\nthose required by the APA when we have not been adamant in requir-\ning agencies to comply with even those baseline procedures. See United\nStates v. Florida East Coast R. Co., 410 U. S. 224, 237–238 (1973)\n(concluding that the APA’s formal procedures, which were to apply\n“[w]hen rules are required by statute to be made on the record after\nopportunity for an agency hearing,” §553(c), were not triggered by a\nstatute that permitted an agency to engage in rulemaking only “ ‘after\n[a] hearing’ ”).\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   19\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nBrown, 441 U. S. 281, 295 (1979), such regulations should\nbe interpreted like any other law. Thus, we should “as-\nsum[e] that the ordinary meaning of the regulation’s\nlanguage expresses” its purpose and enforce it “according\nto its terms.” See Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins.\nCo., 560 U. S. 242, 251 (2010) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Judges are at least as well suited as administra-\ntive agencies to engage in this task. Cf. Marbury, 1\nCranch, at 177 (“It is emphatically the province and duty\nof the judicial department to say what the law is”). In-\ndeed, judges are frequently called upon to interpret the\nmeaning of legal texts and are able to do so even when\nthose texts involve technical language. See, e.g., Barber v.\nGonzales, 347 U. S. 637, 640–643 (1954) (interpreting\ndeportation statute according to technical meaning).\n   Fundamentally, the argument about agency expertise is\nless about the expertise of agencies in interpreting lan-\nguage than it is about the wisdom of according agencies\nbroad flexibility to administer statutory schemes.6 “But\n——————\n   6 Many decisions of this Court invoke agency expertise as a justifica-\n\ntion for deference. This argument has its root in the support for admin-\nistrative agencies that developed during the Progressive Era in this\ncountry. The Era was marked by a move from the individualism that\nhad long characterized American society to the concept of a society\norganized for collective action. See A. Link, Woodrow Wilson and the\nProgressive Era 1910–1917, p. 1 (1954). That move also reflected a\ndeep disdain for the theory of popular sovereignty. As Woodrow Wilson\nwrote before he attained the presidency, “Our peculiar American\ndifficulty in organizing administration is not the danger of losing\nliberty, but the danger of not being able or willing to separate its\nessentials from its accidents. Our success is made doubtful by that\nbesetting error of ours, the error of trying to do too much by vote.”\nWilson, The Study of Administration, 2 Pol. Sci. Q. 197, 214 (1887). In\nPresident Wilson’s view, public criticism would be beneficial in the\nformation of overall policy, but “a clumsy nuisance” in the daily life of\nGovernment—“a rustic handling delicate machinery.” Id., at 215.\nReflecting this belief that bureaucrats might more effectively govern\nthe country than the American people, the progressives ushered in\n20            PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\npolicy arguments supporting even useful ‘political inven-\ntions’ are subject to the demands of the Constitution which\ndefines powers and . . . sets out . . . how those powers are\nto be exercised.” INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 945\n(1983). Even in the face of a perceived necessity, the\nConstitution protects us from ourselves. New York v.\nUnited States, 505 U. S. 144, 187–188 (1992).\n                               B\n   Another oft-recited justification for Seminole Rock def-\nerence is that agencies are better situated to define the\noriginal intent behind their regulations. See Martin v.\nOccupational Safety and Health Review Comm’n, 499 U. S.\n144, 152–153 (1991). Under this justification, “[b]ecause\nthe Secretary [of Labor] promulgates th[e] standards, the\nSecretary is in a better position . . . to reconstruct the\npurpose of the regulations in question.” Id., at 152.\n   This justification rings hollow. This Court has afforded\nSeminole Rock deference to agency interpretations even\nwhen the agency was not the original drafter. See Pauley,\n501 U. S., at 696–698 (applying Seminole Rock deference\nto one agency’s interpretation of another agency’s regula-\ntions because Congress had delegated authority to both to\nadminister the program). It has likewise granted Semi-\nnole Rock deference to agency interpretations that are\ninconsistent with interpretations adopted closer in time to\nthe promulgation of the regulations. See, e.g., Long Island\nCare at Home, 551 U. S., at 170–171.\n   Even if the scope of Seminole Rock deference more\nclosely matched the original-drafter justification, it would\nstill fail. It is the text of the regulations that have the\nforce and effect of law, not the agency’s intent. “Citizens\n——————\nsignificant expansions of the administrative state, ultimately culminat-\ning in the New Deal.

No.\n89 v. Department of Education, 550 U. S. 81, 119 (2007)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Cf. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.\n555, 586–587 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)\n(noting that only “federal standards . . . that are set forth\nin, or necessarily follow from, the statutory text that was\nproduced through the constitutionally required bicameral\nand presentment procedures”—not Congress’ “purposes\nand objectives”—can become the “law of the land”). “To be\ngoverned by legislated text rather than legislators’ inten-\ntions is what it means to be ‘a Government of laws, not of\nmen.’ ” Zuni Public School Dist. No. 89, supra, at 119\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Only the text of a regulation goes\nthrough the procedures established by Congress for agency\nrulemaking. And it is that text on which the public is\nentitled to rely. For the same reasons that we should not\naccord controlling weight to postenactment expressions of\nintent by individual Members of Congress, see Sullivan v.\nFinkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 631–632 (1990) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part), we should not accord controlling\nweight to expressions of intent by administrators of\nagencies.\n                               C\n   A third asserted justification for Seminole Rock defer-\nence is that Congress has delegated to agencies the au-\nthority to interpret their own regulations. See, e.g., Mar-\ntin, 499 U. S., at 151. The theory is that, “[b]ecause\napplying an agency’s regulation to complex or changing\ncircumstances calls upon the agency’s unique expertise\nand policymaking prerogatives, . . . the power authorita-\ntively to interpret its own regulations is a component of\nthe agency’s delegated lawmaking powers.” Ibid.\n   This justification fails because Congress lacks authority\n22          PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nto delegate the power. As we have explained in an analo-\ngous context, “[t]he structure of the Constitution does not\npermit Congress to execute the laws; it follows that Con-\ngress cannot grant to an officer under its control what it\ndoes not possess.” Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 726\n(1986). Similarly, the Constitution does not empower\nCongress to issue a judicially binding interpretation of the\nConstitution or its laws. Lacking the power itself, it can-\nnot delegate that power to an agency.\n   To hold otherwise would be to vitiate the separation of\npowers and ignore the “sense of a sharp necessity to sepa-\nrate the legislative from the judicial power . . . [that]\ntriumphed among the Framers of the new Federal Consti-\ntution.” Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211,\n221 (1995). As this Court has explained, the “essential\nbalance” of the Constitution is that the Legislature is\n“possessed of power to ‘prescrib[e] the rules by which the\nduties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated,’ but\nthe power of ‘[t]he interpretation of the laws’ [is] ‘the\nproper and peculiar province of the courts.’ ” Id., at 222\n(citation omitted; third brackets added). Although the\nConstitution imposes a duty on all three branches to\ninterpret the laws within their own spheres, the power to\ncreate legally binding interpretations rests with the Judi-\nciary. See Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 177, 179–180.\n                              D\n  A final proposed justification for Seminole Rock defer-\nence is that too much oversight of administrative matters\nwould imperil the “independence and esteem” of judges.\nSee, e.g., Charles Evans Hughes, Speech before the Elmira\nChamber of Commerce, May 3, 1907, in Addresses of\nCharles Evans Hughes, 1906–1916, p. 185 (2d ed. 1916).\nThe argument goes that questions of administration are\nthose which “lie close to the public impatience,” id., at 186,\nand thus the courts’ resolution of such questions could\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           23\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n“expose them to the fire of public criticism,” id., at 187.\n   But this argument, which boils down to a policy judg-\nment of questionable validity, cannot vitiate the constitu-\ntional allocation of powers. The Judicial Branch is sepa-\nrate from the political branches for a reason: It has the\nobligation to apply the law to cases and controversies that\ncome before it, and concerns about the popular esteem of\nindividual judges—or even the Judiciary as a whole—have\nno place in that analysis. Our system of Government\ncould not long survive absent adherence to the written\nConstitution that formed it.\n                         *     *     *\n   Although on the surface these cases require only a\nstraightforward application of the APA, closer scrutiny\nreveals serious constitutional questions lurking beneath. I\nhave “acknowledge[d] the importance of stare decisis to the\nstability of our Nation’s legal system.” “But stare decisis is\nonly an ‘adjunct’ of our duty as judges to decide by our best\nlights what the Constitution means.” McDonald v. Chicago,\n561 U. S. 742, 812 (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment) (citation omitted). By\nmy best lights, the entire line of precedent beginning with\nSeminole Rock raises serious constitutional questions and\nshould be reconsidered in an appropriate case.\n</pre>", "id": 2784695, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/03/09/perez_v._mortgage_bankers_assn..pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2014                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued December 1, 2014—Decided March 9, 2015*\nThe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) establishes the procedures\n  federal administrative agencies use for “rule making,” defined as the\n  process of “formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.” 5 U. S. C.\n  §551(5). The APA distinguishes between two types of rules: So-called\n  “legislative rules” are issued through notice-and-comment rulemak-\n  ing, see §§553(b), (c), and have the “force and effect of law,” Chrysler\n  Corp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281, 302–303. “Interpretive rules,” by con-\n  trast, are “issued . . . to advise the public of the agency’s construction\n  of the statutes and rules which it administers,” Shalala v.

C. Circuit’s\n    decision in Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. D. C. Arena L. P., 117 F. 3d\n    579. The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine holds that an agency must use\n    the APA’s notice-and-comment procedures when it wishes to issue a\n    new interpretation of a regulation that deviates significantly from a\n    previously adopted interpretation. The District Court granted sum-\n    mary judgment to the Department, but the D. C. Circuit applied Par-\n    alyzed Veterans and reversed.\nHeld: The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine is contrary to the clear text of\n the APA’s rulemaking provisions and improperly imposes on agencies\n an obligation beyond the APA’s maximum procedural requirements.\n Pp. 6–14.\n      (a) The APA’s categorical exemption of interpretive rules from\n the notice-and-comment process is fatal to the Paralyzed Veterans\n doctrine. The D. C. Circuit’s reading of the APA conflates the differ-\n ing purposes of §§1 and 4 of the Act. Section 1 requires agencies to\n use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they\n used to issue the rule, see 5 U. S. C. §551(5), but it does not say what\n procedures an agency must use when it engages in rulemaking. That\n is the purpose of §4. And §4 specifically exempts interpretive rules\n from notice-and-comment requirements. Because an agency is not\n required to use notice-and-comment procedures to issue an initial in-\n terpretive rule, it is also not required to use those procedures to\n amend or repeal that rule. Pp. 7–8.\n      (b) This straightforward reading of the APA harmonizes with\n longstanding principles of this Court’s administrative law jurispru-\n dence, which has consistently held that the APA “sets forth the full\n extent of judicial authority to review executive agency action for pro-\n cedural correctness,” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S.\n 502, 513. The APA’s rulemaking provisions are no exception: §4 es-\n tablishes “the maximum procedural requirements” that courts may\n impose upon agencies engaged in rulemaking. Vermont Yankee Nu-\n clear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435\n U. S. 519, 524. By mandating notice-and-comment procedures when\n an agency changes its interpretation of one of the regulations it en-\n forces, Paralyzed Veterans creates a judge-made procedural right that\n is inconsistent with Congress’ standards. Pp. 8–9.\n      (c) MBA’s reasons for upholding the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine\n are unpersuasive. Pp. 9–14.\n         (1) MBA asserts that an agency interpretation of a regulation\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  that significantly alters the agency’s prior interpretation effectively\n  amends the underlying regulation. That assertion conflicts with the\n  ordinary meaning of the words “amend” and “interpret,” and it is im-\n  possible to reconcile with the longstanding recognition that interpre-\n  tive rules do not have the force and effect of law. MBA’s theory is\n  particularly odd in light of the limitations of the Paralyzed Veterans\n  doctrine, which applies only when an agency has previously adopted\n  an interpretation of its regulation. MBA fails to explain why its ar-\n  gument regarding revised interpretations should not also extend to\n  the agency’s first interpretation. Christensen v. Harris County, 529\n  U. S. 576, and Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S. 87,\n  distinguished. Pp. 9–12.\n          (2) MBA also contends that the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine re-\n  inforces the APA’s goal of procedural fairness. But the APA already\n  provides recourse to regulated entities from agency decisions that\n  skirt notice-and-comment provisions by placing a variety of con-\n  straints on agency decisionmaking, e.g., the arbitrary and capricious\n  standard. In addition, Congress may include safe-harbor provisions\n  in legislation to shelter regulated entities from liability when they re-\n  ly on previous agency interpretations. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §§259(a),\n  (b)(1). Pp. 12–13.\n          (3) MBA has waived its argument that the 2010 Administra-\n  tor’s Interpretation should be classified as a legislative rule. From\n  the beginning, this suit has been litigated on the understanding that\n  the Administrator’s Interpretation is an interpretive rule. Neither\n  the District Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed this argument\n  below, and MBA did not raise it here in opposing certiorari.

See 5 U. S. C. §553(b)(A). The United States Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has never-\ntheless held, in a line of cases beginning with Paralyzed\nVeterans of Am. v. D. C. Arena L. P., 117 F. 3d 579 (1997),\nthat an agency must use the APA’s notice-and-comment\nprocedures when it wishes to issue a new interpretation of\na regulation that deviates significantly from one the agency\nhas previously adopted. The question in these cases is\nwhether the rule announced in Paralyzed Veterans is\nconsistent with the APA. We hold that it is not.\n2           PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n                              A\n   The APA establishes the procedures federal administra-\ntive agencies use for “rule making,” defined as the process\nof “formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.” §551(5).\n“Rule,” in turn, is defined broadly to include “statement[s]\nof general or particular applicability and future effect”\nthat are designed to “implement, interpret, or prescribe\nlaw or policy.” §551(4).\n   Section 4 of the APA, 5 U. S. C. §553, prescribes a three-\nstep procedure for so-called “notice-and-comment rulemak-\ning.” First, the agency must issue a “[g]eneral notice of\nproposed rule making,” ordinarily by publication in the\nFederal Register. §553(b). Second, if “notice [is] re-\nquired,” the agency must “give interested persons an\nopportunity to participate in the rule making through\nsubmission of written data, views, or arguments.” §553(c).\nAn agency must consider and respond to significant com-\nments received during the period for public comment. See\nCitizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S.\n402, 416 (1971); Thompson v. Clark, 741 F. 2d 401, 408\n(CADC 1984). Third, when the agency promulgates the\nfinal rule, it must include in the rule’s text “a concise\ngeneral statement of [its] basis and purpose.” §553(c).\nRules issued through the notice-and-comment process are\noften referred to as “legislative rules” because they have\nthe “force and effect of law.” Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,\n441 U. S. 281, 302–303 (1979) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Not all “rules” must be issued through the notice-and-\ncomment process. Section 4(b)(A) of the APA provides\nthat, unless another statute states otherwise, the notice-\nand-comment requirement “does not apply” to “interpreta-\ntive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency\norganization, procedure, or practice.”           5 U. S. C.\n§553(b)(A). The term “interpretative rule,” or “interpre-\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntive rule,”1 is not further defined by the APA, and its\nprecise meaning is the source of much scholarly and judi-\ncial debate. See generally Pierce, Distinguishing Legisla-\ntive Rules From Interpretative Rules, 52 Admin. L. Rev.\n547 (2000); Manning, Nonlegislative Rules, 72 Geo. Wash.\nL. Rev. 893 (2004). We need not, and do not, wade into\nthat debate here. For our purposes, it suffices to say that\nthe critical feature of interpretive rules is that they are\n“issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency’s\nconstruction of the statutes and rules which it adminis-\nters.” Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S.\n87, 99 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nabsence of a notice-and-comment obligation makes the\nprocess of issuing interpretive rules comparatively easier\nfor agencies than issuing legislative rules. But that con-\nvenience comes at a price: Interpretive rules “do not have\nthe force and effect of law and are not accorded that\nweight in the adjudicatory process.” Ibid.\n                              B\n   These cases began as a dispute over efforts by the De-\npartment of Labor to determine whether mortgage-loan\nofficers are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act of\n1938 (FLSA), 52 Stat. 1060, as amended, 29 U. S. C. §201\net seq. The FLSA “establishe[s] a minimum wage and\novertime compensation for each hour worked in excess of\n40 hours in each workweek” for many employees. Integ-\nrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Busk, 574 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 3). Certain classes of employees, how-\never, are exempt from these provisions. Among these\nexempt individuals are those “employed in a bona fide\nexecutive, administrative, or professional capacity . . . or\nin the capacity of outside salesman . . . .” §213(a)(1). The\n\n——————\n  1 The latter is the more common phrasing today, and the one we use\n\nthroughout this opinion.\n4          PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nexemption for such employees is known as the “adminis-\ntrative” exemption.\n   The FLSA grants the Secretary of Labor authority to\n“defin[e]” and “delimi[t]” the categories of exempt admin-\nistrative employees. Ibid. The Secretary’s current regu-\nlations regarding the administrative exemption were\npromulgated in 2004 through a notice-and-comment\nrulemaking. As relevant here, the 2004 regulations dif-\nfered from the previous regulations in that they contained\na new section providing several examples of exempt ad-\nministrative employees. See 29 CFR §541.203. One of the\nexamples is “[e]mployees in the financial services indus-\ntry,” who, depending on the nature of their day-to-day\nwork, “generally meet the duties requirements for the\nadministrative exception.” §541.203(b). The financial\nservices example ends with a caveat, noting that “an\nemployee whose primary duty is selling financial products\ndoes not qualify for the administrative exemption.” Ibid.\n   In 1999 and again in 2001, the Department’s Wage and\nHour Division issued letters opining that mortgage-loan\nofficers do not qualify for the administrative exemption.\nSee Opinion Letter, Loan Officers/Exempt Status, 6A\nLRR, Wages and Hours Manual 99:8351 (Feb. 16, 2001);\nOpinion Letter, Mortgage Loan Officers/Exempt Status,\nid., at 99:8249. (May 17, 1999). In other words, the De-\npartment concluded that the FLSA’s minimum wage and\nmaximum hour requirements applied to mortgage-loan\nofficers. When the Department promulgated its current\nFLSA regulations in 2004, respondent Mortgage Bankers\nAssociation (MBA), a national trade association represent-\ning real estate finance companies, requested a new opinion\ninterpreting the revised regulations. In 2006, the De-\npartment issued an opinion letter finding that mortgage-\nloan officers fell within the administrative exemption\nunder the 2004 regulations. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 13–1041, pp. 70a–84a. Four years later, however, the\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWage and Hour Division again altered its interpretation of\nthe FLSA’s administrative exemption as it applied to\nmortgage-loan officers. Id., at 49a–69a. Reviewing the\nprovisions of the 2004 regulations and judicial decisions\naddressing the administrative exemption, the Depart-\nment’s 2010 Administrator’s Interpretation concluded that\nmortgage-loan officers “have a primary duty of making\nsales for their employers, and, therefore, do not qualify”\nfor the administrative exemption. Id., at 49a, 69a. The\nDepartment accordingly withdrew its 2006 opinion letter,\nwhich it now viewed as relying on “misleading assump-\ntion[s] and selective and narrow analysis” of the exemp-\ntion example in §541.203(b). Id., at 68a. Like the 1999,\n2001, and 2006 opinion letters, the 2010 Administrator’s\nInterpretation was issued without notice or an opportunity\nfor comment.\n                             C\n  MBA filed a complaint in Federal District Court chal-\nlenging the Administrator’s Interpretation. MBA con-\ntended that the document was inconsistent with the 2004\nregulation it purported to interpret, and thus arbitrary\nand capricious in violation of §10 of the APA, 5 U. S. C.\n§706. More pertinent to this case, MBA also argued that\nthe Administrator’s Interpretation was procedurally in-\nvalid in light of the D. C. Circuit’s decision in Paralyzed\nVeterans, 117 F. 3d 579. Under the Paralyzed Veterans\ndoctrine, if “an agency has given its regulation a definitive\ninterpretation, and later significantly revises that inter-\npretation, the agency has in effect amended its rule, some-\nthing it may not accomplish” under the APA “without\nnotice and comment.” Alaska Professional Hunters Assn.,\nInc. v. FAA, 177 F. 3d 1030, 1034 (CADC 1999). Three\nformer mortgage-loan officers—Beverly Buck, Ryan Henry,\nand Jerome Nickols—subsequently intervened in the\n6             PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncase to defend the Administrator’s Interpretation.2\n   The District Court granted summary judgment to the\nDepartment.      Mortgage Bankers Assn. v. Solis, 864\nF. Supp. 2d 193 (DC 2012). Though it accepted the par-\nties’ characterization of the Administrator’s Interpretation\nas an interpretive rule, id., at 203, n. 7, the District Court\ndetermined that the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine was\ninapplicable because MBA had failed to establish its reli-\nance on the contrary interpretation expressed in the De-\npartment’s 2006 opinion letter. The Administrator’s In-\nterpretation, the District Court further determined, was\nfully supported by the text of the 2004 FLSA regulations.\nThe court accordingly held that the 2010 interpretation\nwas not arbitrary or capricious.3\n   The D. C. Circuit reversed. Mortgage Bankers Assn. v.\nHarris, 720 F. 3d 966 (2013). Bound to the rule of Para-\nlyzed Veterans by precedent, the Court of Appeals rejected\nthe Government’s call to abandon the doctrine. 720 F. 3d.,\nat 967, n. 1. In the court’s view, “[t]he only question”\nproperly before it was whether the District Court had\nerred in requiring MBA to prove that it relied on the\nDepartment’s prior interpretation. Id., at 967. Explaining\nthat reliance was not a required element of the Paralyzed\nVeterans doctrine, and noting the Department’s concession\nthat a prior, conflicting interpretation of the 2004 regula-\ntions existed, the D. C. Circuit concluded that the 2010\nAdministrator’s Interpretation had to be vacated.\n   We granted certiorari, 573 U. S. __ (2014), and now\nreverse.\n                            II\n    The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine is contrary to the clear\n——————\n    2 Buck,\n         Henry, and Nickols are petitioners in No. 13–1052 and re-\nspondents in No. 13–1041.\n  3 MBA did not challenge this aspect of the District Court’s decision on\n\nappeal.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntext of the APA’s rulemaking provisions, and it improperly\nimposes on agencies an obligation beyond the “maximum\nprocedural requirements” specified in the APA, Vermont\nYankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, 524 (1978).\n                              A\n  The text of the APA answers the question presented.\nSection 4 of the APA provides that “notice of proposed rule\nmaking shall be published in the Federal Register.” 5\nU. S. C. §553(b). When such notice is required by the\nAPA, “the agency shall give interested persons an oppor-\ntunity to participate in the rule making.” §553(c). But §4\nfurther states that unless “notice or hearing is required by\nstatute,” the Act’s notice-and-comment requirement “does\nnot apply . . . to interpretative rules.” §553(b)(A). This\nexemption of interpretive rules from the notice-and-\ncomment process is categorical, and it is fatal to the rule\nannounced in Paralyzed Veterans.\n  Rather than examining the exemption for interpretive\nrules contained in §4(b)(A) of the APA, the D. C. Circuit in\nParalyzed Veterans focused its attention on §1 of the Act.\nThat section defines “rule making” to include not only the\ninitial issuance of new rules, but also “repeal[s]” or\n“amend[ments]” of existing rules. See §551(5). Because\nnotice-and-comment requirements may apply even to\nthese later agency actions, the court reasoned, “allow[ing]\nan agency to make a fundamental change in its interpre-\ntation of a substantive regulation without notice and\ncomment” would undermine the APA’s procedural frame-\nwork. 117 F. 3d, at 586.\n  This reading of the APA conflates the differing purposes\nof §§1 and 4 of the Act. Section 1 defines what a rule-\nmaking is. It does not, however, say what procedures an\nagency must use when it engages in rulemaking. That is\nthe purpose of §4. And §4 specifically exempts interpretive\n8           PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrules from the notice-and-comment requirements that\napply to legislative rules. So, the D. C. Circuit correctly\nread §1 of the APA to mandate that agencies use the same\nprocedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used\nto issue the rule in the first instance. See FCC v. Fox\nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502, 515 (2009) (the\nAPA “make[s] no distinction . . . between initial agency\naction and subsequent agency action undoing or revising\nthat action”). Where the court went wrong was in failing\nto apply that accurate understanding of §1 to the exemp-\ntion for interpretive rules contained in §4: Because an\nagency is not required to use notice-and-comment proce-\ndures to issue an initial interpretive rule, it is also not\nrequired to use those procedures when it amends or re-\npeals that interpretive rule.\n                              B\n  The straightforward reading of the APA we now adopt\nharmonizes with longstanding principles of our adminis-\ntrative law jurisprudence. Time and again, we have reit-\nerated that the APA “sets forth the full extent of judicial\nauthority to review executive agency action for procedural\ncorrectness.” Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S., at\n513. Beyond the APA’s minimum requirements, courts\nlack authority “to impose upon [an] agency its own notion\nof which procedures are ‘best’ or most likely to further\nsome vague, undefined public good.” Vermont Yankee, 435\nU. S., at 549. To do otherwise would violate “the very\nbasic tenet of administrative law that agencies should be\nfree to fashion their own rules of procedure.” Id., at 544.\n   These foundational principles apply with equal force to\nthe APA’s procedures for rulemaking. We explained in\nVermont Yankee that §4 of the Act “established the maxi-\nmum procedural requirements which Congress was willing\nto have the courts impose upon agencies in conducting\nrulemaking procedures.” Id., at 524. “Agencies are free to\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngrant additional procedural rights in the exercise of their\ndiscretion, but reviewing courts are generally not free to\nimpose them if the agencies have not chosen to grant\nthem.” Ibid.\n   The Paralyzed Veterans doctrine creates just such a\njudge-made procedural right: the right to notice and an\nopportunity to comment when an agency changes its\ninterpretation of one of the regulations it enforces. That\nrequirement may be wise policy. Or it may not. Regard-\nless, imposing such an obligation is the responsibility of\nCongress or the administrative agencies, not the courts.\nWe trust that Congress weighed the costs and benefits of\nplacing more rigorous procedural restrictions on the issu-\nance of interpretive rules. See id., at 523 (when Congress\nenacted the APA, it “settled long-continued and hard-\nfought contentions, and enact[ed] a formula upon which\nopposing social and political forces have come to rest”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). In the end, Congress\ndecided to adopt standards that permit agencies to prom-\nulgate freely such rules—whether or not they are con-\nsistent with earlier interpretations. That the D. C. Circuit\nwould have struck the balance differently does not permit\nthat court or this one to overturn Congress’ contrary\njudgment. Cf. Law v. Siegel, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\nop., at 11).\n                           III\n  MBA offers several reasons why the Paralyzed Veterans\ndoctrine should be upheld. They are not persuasive.\n                              A\n   MBA begins its defense of the Paralyzed Veterans doc-\ntrine by attempting to bolster the D. C. Circuit’s reading of\nthe APA. “Paralyzed Veterans,” MBA contends, “simply\nacknowledges the reality that where an agency significantly\nalters a prior, definitive interpretation of a regulation, it\n10            PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhas effectively amended the regulation itself,” something\nthat under the APA requires use of notice-and-comment\nprocedures. Brief for Respondent 20–21.\n   The act of “amending,” however, in both ordinary par-\nlance and legal usage, has its own meaning separate and\napart from the act of “interpreting.” Compare Black’s Law\nDictionary 98 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “amend” as “[t]o\nchange the wording of ” or “formally alter . . . by striking\nout, inserting, or substituting words”), with id., at 943\n(defining “interpret” as “[t]o ascertain the meaning and\nsignificance of thoughts expressed in words”). One would\nnot normally say that a court “amends” a statute when it\ninterprets its text. So too can an agency “interpret” a\nregulation without “effectively amend[ing]” the underlying\nsource of law. MBA does not explain how, precisely, an\ninterpretive rule changes the regulation it interprets, and\nits assertion is impossible to reconcile with the longstand-\ning recognition that interpretive rules do not have the\nforce and effect of law. See Chrysler Corp., 441 U. S., at\n302, n. 31 (citing Attorney General’s Manual on the Ad-\nministrative Procedure Act 30, n. 3 (1947)); Skidmore v.\nSwift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944).\n   MBA’s “interpretation-as-amendment” theory is particu-\nlarly odd in light of the limitations of the Paralyzed Veter-\nans doctrine. Recall that the rule of Paralyzed Veterans\napplies only when an agency has previously adopted an\ninterpretation of its regulation. Yet in that initial inter-\npretation as much as all that come after, the agency is\ngiving a definite meaning to an ambiguous text—the very\nact MBA insists requires notice and comment. MBA is\nunable to say why its arguments regarding revised inter-\npretations should not also extend to the agency’s first\ninterpretation.4\n——————\n  4 MBA alternatively suggests that interpretive rules have the force of\n\nlaw because an agency’s interpretation of its own regulations may be\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Next, MBA argues that the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine\nis more consistent with this Court’s “functional” approach\nto interpreting the APA. Relying on Christensen v. Harris\nCounty, 529 U. S. 576 (2000), and Shalala v. Guernsey\nMemorial Hospital, 514 U. S. 87, MBA contends that we\nhave already recognized that an agency may not “avoid\nnotice-and-comment procedures by cloaking its actions in\nthe mantle of mere ‘interpretation.’ ” Brief for Respondent\n23–24.\n   Neither of the cases MBA cites supports its argument.\nOur decision in Christensen did not address a change in\nagency interpretation. Instead, we there refused to give\ndeference to an agency’s interpretation of an unambiguous\nregulation, observing that to defer in such a case would\nallow the agency “to create de facto a new regulation.” 529\nU. S., at 588. Put differently, Christensen held that the\nagency interpretation at issue was substantively invalid\nbecause it conflicted with the text of the regulation the\nagency purported to interpret. That holding is irrelevant\nto this suit and to the Paralyzed Veterans rule, which\nassesses whether an agency interpretation is procedurally\ninvalid.\n\n——————\nentitled to deference under Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997), and\nBowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410 (1945). Even in\ncases where an agency’s interpretation receives Auer deference, how-\never, it is the court that ultimately decides whether a given regulation\nmeans what the agency says. Moreover, Auer deference is not an\ninexorable command in all cases. See Christopher v. SmithKline\nBeecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 10) (Auer defer-\nence is inappropriate “when the agency’s interpretation is plainly\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation” or “when there is reason\nto suspect that the agency’s interpretation does not reflect the agency’s\nfair and considered judgment” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nThomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 515 (1994) (“[A]n\nagency’s interpretation of a . . . regulation that conflicts with a prior\ninterpretation is entitled to considerably less deference than a consist-\nently held agency view” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n12         PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n  As for Guernsey, that case is fully consistent with—\nindeed, confirms—what the text of the APA makes plain:\n“Interpretive rules do not require notice and comment.”\n514 U. S., at 99. Sidestepping this inconvenient language,\nMBA instead quotes a portion of the Court’s opinion stat-\ning that “APA rulemaking would still be required if [an\nagency] adopted a new position inconsistent with . . .\nexisting regulations.” Id., at 100. But the statement on\nwhich MBA relies is dictum. Worse, it is dictum taken out\nof context. The “regulations” to which the Court referred\nwere two provisions of the Medicare reimbursement\nscheme. And it is apparent from the Court’s description of\nthese regulations in Part II of the opinion that they were\nlegislative rules, issued through the notice-and-comment\nprocess. See id., at 91–92 (noting that the disputed regu-\nlations were codified in the Code of Federal Regulations).\nRead properly, then, the cited passage from Guernsey\nmerely means that “an agency may only change its inter-\npretation if the revised interpretation is consistent with\nthe underlying regulations.” Brief for Petitioners in No.\n13–1052, p. 44.\n                            B\n  In the main, MBA attempts to justify the Paralyzed\nVeterans doctrine on practical and policy grounds. MBA\ncontends that the doctrine reinforces the APA’s goal of\n“procedural fairness” by preventing agencies from unilat-\nerally and unexpectedly altering their interpretation of\nimportant regulations. Brief for Respondent 16.\n  There may be times when an agency’s decision to issue\nan interpretive rule, rather than a legislative rule, is\ndriven primarily by a desire to skirt notice-and-comment\nprovisions. But regulated entities are not without re-\ncourse in such situations. Quite the opposite. The APA\ncontains a variety of constraints on agency decisionmak-\ning—the arbitrary and capricious standard being among\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

As we held in Fox Television Stations,\nand underscore again today, the APA requires an agency\nto provide more substantial justification when “its new\npolicy rests upon factual findings that contradict those\nwhich underlay its prior policy; or when its prior policy\nhas engendered serious reliance interests that must be\ntaken into account. It would be arbitrary and capricious\nto ignore such matters.” 556 U. S., at 515 (citation omit-\nted); see also id., at 535 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment).\n   In addition, Congress is aware that agencies sometimes\nalter their views in ways that upset settled reliance inter-\nests. For that reason, Congress sometimes includes in the\nstatutes it drafts safe-harbor provisions that shelter regu-\nlated entities from liability when they act in conformance\nwith previous agency interpretations. The FLSA includes\none such provision: As amended by the Portal-to-Portal\nAct of 1947, 29 U. S. C. §251 et seq., the FLSA provides\nthat “no employer shall be subject to any liability” for\nfailing “to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation”\nif it demonstrates that the “act or omission complained of\nwas in good faith in conformity with and in reliance on\nany written administrative regulation, order, ruling,\napproval, or interpretation” of the Administrator of the\nDepartment’s Wage and Hour Division, even when the\nguidance is later “modified or rescinded.” §§259(a), (b)(1).\nThese safe harbors will often protect parties from liability\nwhen an agency adopts an interpretation that conflicts\nwith its previous position.5\n——————\n   5 The United States acknowledged at argument that even in situa-\n\ntions where a statute does not contain a safe-harbor provision similar\nto the one included in the FLSA, an agency’s ability to pursue enforce-\nment actions against regulated entities for conduct in conformance with\nprior agency interpretations may be limited by principles of retroactiv-\nity. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44–45. We have no occasion to consider how\nsuch principles might apply here.\n14          PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              C\n   MBA changes direction in the second half of its brief,\ncontending that if the Court overturns the Paralyzed\nVeterans rule, the D. C. Circuit’s judgment should none-\ntheless be affirmed. That is so, MBA says, because the\nagency interpretation at issue—the 2010 Administrator’s\nInterpretation—should in fact be classified as a legislative\nrule.\n   We will not address this argument. From the begin-\nning, the parties litigated this suit on the understanding\nthat the Administrator’s Interpretation was—as its name\nsuggests—an interpretive rule. Indeed, if MBA did not\nthink the Administrator’s Interpretation was an interpre-\ntive rule, then its decision to invoke the Paralyzed Veter-\nans doctrine in attacking the rule is passing strange.\nAfter all, Paralyzed Veterans applied only to interpretive\nrules. Consequently, neither the District Court nor the\nD. C. Circuit considered MBA’s current claim that the\nAdministrator’s Interpretation is actually a legislative\nrule. Beyond that, and more important still, MBA’s brief\nin opposition to certiorari did not dispute petitioners’\nassertions—in their framing of the question presented and\nin the substance of their petitions—that the Administra-\ntor’s Interpretation is an interpretive rule. Thus, even\nassuming MBA did not waive the argument below, it has\ndone so in this Court. See this Court’s Rule 15.2; Carcieri\nv. Salazar, 555 U.

The crea-\ntion of that doctrine may have been prompted by an un-\nderstandable concern about the aggrandizement of the\npower of administrative agencies as a result of the com-\nbined effect of (1) the effective delegation to agencies by\nCongress of huge swaths of lawmaking authority, (2) the\nexploitation by agencies of the uncertain boundary be-\ntween legislative and interpretive rules, and (3) this\nCourt’s cases holding that courts must ordinarily defer to\nan agency’s interpretation of its own ambiguous regula-\ntions. See Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S.\n410 (1945). I do not dismiss these concerns, but the Para-\nlyzed Veterans doctrine is not a viable cure for these prob-\n2           PEREZ v.

C. Circuit’s\nParalyzed Veterans holding with the Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act. Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. D. C. Arena L.P.,\n117 F. 3d 579 (CADC 1997). I do not agree, however, with\nthe Court’s portrayal of the result it produces as a vindica-\ntion of the balance Congress struck when it “weighed the\ncosts and benefits of placing more rigorous . . . restrictions\non the issuance of interpretive rules.” Ante, at 9. That\ndepiction is accurate enough if one looks at this case in\nisolation. Considered alongside our law of deference to\nadministrative determinations, however, today’s decision\nproduces a balance between power and procedure quite\ndifferent from the one Congress chose when it enacted the\nAPA.\n   “The [APA] was framed against a background of rapid\nexpansion of the administrative process as a check upon\n2            PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nadministrators whose zeal might otherwise have carried\nthem to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating\ntheir offices.” United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U. S.\n632, 644 (1950). The Act guards against excesses in rule-\nmaking by requiring notice and comment. Before an\nagency makes a rule, it normally must notify the public of\nthe proposal, invite them to comment on its shortcomings,\nconsider and respond to their arguments, and explain its\nfinal decision in a statement of the rule’s basis and pur-\npose. 5 U. S. C. §553(b)–(c); ante, at 2.\n   The APA exempts interpretive rules from these re-\nquirements. §553(b)(A). But this concession to agencies\nwas meant to be more modest in its effects than it is today.\nFor despite exempting interpretive rules from notice and\ncomment, the Act provides that “the reviewing court\nshall . . . interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,\nand determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of\nan agency action.” §706 (emphasis added). The Act thus\ncontemplates that courts, not agencies, will authoritatively\nresolve ambiguities in statutes and regulations. In such\na regime, the exemption for interpretive rules does not add\nmuch to agency power. An agency may use interpretive\nrules to advise the public by explaining its interpretation\nof the law. But an agency may not use interpretive rules\nto bind the public by making law, because it remains the\nresponsibility of the court to decide whether the law\nmeans what the agency says it means.\n   Heedless of the original design of the APA, we have\ndeveloped an elaborate law of deference to agencies’ inter-\npretations of statutes and regulations. Never mentioning\n§706’s directive that the “reviewing court . . . interpret . . .\nstatutory provisions,” we have held that agencies may\nauthoritatively resolve ambiguities in statutes. Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 842–843 (1984). And never mentioning\n§706’s directive that the “reviewing court . . . determine\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency\naction,” we have—relying on a case decided before the\nAPA, Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410\n(1945)—held that agencies may authoritatively resolve\nambiguities in regulations. Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S.\n452, 461 (1997).\n   By supplementing the APA with judge-made doctrines\nof deference, we have revolutionized the import of inter-\npretive rules’ exemption from notice-and-comment rule-\nmaking. Agencies may now use these rules not just to\nadvise the public, but also to bind them. After all, if an\ninterpretive rule gets deference, the people are bound to\nobey it on pain of sanction, no less surely than they are\nbound to obey substantive rules, which are accorded simi-\nlar deference. Interpretive rules that command deference\ndo have the force of law.\n   The Court’s reasons for resisting this obvious point\nwould not withstand a gentle breeze. Even when an agen-\ncy’s interpretation gets deference, the Court argues, “it is\nthe court that ultimately decides whether [the text] means\nwhat the agency says.” Ante, at 10–11, n. 4. That is not\nquite so. So long as the agency does not stray beyond the\nambiguity in the text being interpreted, deference compels\nthe reviewing court to “decide” that the text means what\nthe agency says. The Court continues that “deference is\nnot an inexorable command in all cases,” because (for\nexample) it does not apply to plainly erroneous interpreta-\ntions. Ibid. True, but beside the point. Saying all inter-\npretive rules lack force of law because plainly erroneous\ninterpretations do not bind courts is like saying all sub-\nstantive rules lack force of law because arbitrary and\ncapricious rules do not bind courts. Of course an interpre-\ntive rule must meet certain conditions before it gets defer-\nence—the interpretation must, for instance, be reason-\nable—but once it does so it is every bit as binding as a\nsubstantive rule. So the point stands: By deferring to\n4           PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninterpretive rules, we have allowed agencies to make\nbinding rules unhampered by notice-and-comment\nprocedures.\n    The problem is bad enough, and perhaps insoluble if\nChevron is not to be uprooted, with respect to interpretive\nrules setting forth agency interpretation of statutes. But\nan agency’s interpretation of its own regulations is an-\nother matter. By giving that category of interpretive rules\nAuer deference, we do more than allow the agency to make\nbinding regulations without notice and comment. Because\nthe agency (not Congress) drafts the substantive rules\nthat are the object of those interpretations, giving them\ndeference allows the agency to control the extent of its\nnotice-and-comment-free domain. To expand this domain,\nthe agency need only write substantive rules more\nbroadly and vaguely, leaving plenty of gaps to be filled in\nlater, using interpretive rules unchecked by notice and\ncomment. The APA does not remotely contemplate this\nregime.\n    Still and all, what are we to do about the problem? The\nParalyzed Veterans doctrine is a courageous (indeed,\nbrazen) attempt to limit the mischief by requiring an\ninterpretive rule to go through notice and comment if it\nrevises an earlier definitive interpretation of a regulation.\nThat solution is unlawful for the reasons set forth in the\nCourt’s opinion: It contradicts the APA’s unqualified ex-\nemption of interpretive rules from notice-and-comment\nrulemaking.\n    But I think there is another solution—one unavailable\nto the D. C. Circuit since it involves the overruling of one\nthis Court’s decisions (that being even a greater fault than\nmerely ignoring the APA). As I have described elsewhere,\nthe rule of Chevron, if it did not comport with the APA, at\nleast was in conformity with the long history of judicial\nreview of executive action, where “[s]tatutory ambiguities\n. . . were left to reasonable resolution by the Executive.”\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

I would therefore restore the\nbalance originally struck by the APA with respect to an\nagency’s interpretation of its own regulations, not by\nrewriting the Act in order to make up for Auer, but by\nabandoning Auer and applying the Act as written. The\nagency is free to interpret its own regulations with or\nwithout notice and comment; but courts will decide—with\nno deference to the agency—whether that interpretation is\ncorrect.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

D. C.\nArena L. P., 117 F. 3d 579 (CADC 1997), is inconsistent\nwith the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C.\n§551 et seq., and must be rejected. An agency’s substantial\nrevision of its interpretation of a regulation does not\namount to an “amendment” of the regulation as that word\nis used in the statute.\n   I write separately because these cases call into question\nthe legitimacy of our precedents requiring deference to\nadministrative interpretations of regulations. That line of\nprecedents, beginning with Bowles v. Seminole Rock &\nSand Co., 325 U. S. 410 (1945), requires judges to defer to\nagency interpretations of regulations, thus, as happened\nin these cases, giving legal effect to the interpretations\nrather than the regulations themselves. Because this\ndoctrine effects a transfer of the judicial power to an exec-\n2           PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nutive agency, it raises constitutional concerns. This line of\nprecedents undermines our obligation to provide a judicial\ncheck on the other branches, and it subjects regulated\nparties to precisely the abuses that the Framers sought to\nprevent.\n                               I\n   The doctrine of deference to an agency’s interpretation\nof regulations is usually traced back to this Court’s deci-\nsion in Seminole Rock, supra, which involved the interpre-\ntation of a war-time price control regulation, id., at 411.\nAlong with a general price freeze, the Administrator of the\nOffice of Price Administration had promulgated special-\nized regulations governing the maximum price for differ-\nent commodities. Id., at 413. When the Administrator\nbrought an enforcement action against a manufacturer of\ncrushed stone, the manufacturer challenged the Adminis-\ntrator’s interpretation of his regulations.\n   The lower courts agreed with the manufacturer’s inter-\npretation, id., at 412–413, but this Court reversed. In\nsetting out the approach it would apply to the case, the\nCourt announced—without citation or explanation—that\nan administrative interpretation of an ambiguous regula-\ntion was entitled to “controlling weight”:\n    “Since this involves an interpretation of an adminis-\n    trative regulation a court must necessarily look to the\n    administrative construction of the regulation if the\n    meaning of the words used is in doubt. The intention\n    of Congress or the principles of the Constitution in\n    some situations may be relevant in the first instance\n    in choosing between various constructions. But the\n    ultimate criterion is the administrative interpreta-\n    tion, which becomes of controlling weight unless it is\n    plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.”\n    Id., at 413–414.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    3\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nThe Court then concluded that the rule “clearly” favored\nthe Administrator’s interpretation, rendering this discus-\nsion dictum. Id., at 415–417.\n   From this unsupported rule developed a doctrine of\ndeference that has taken on a life of its own.1 It has been\nbroadly applied to regulations issued by agencies across a\nbroad spectrum of subjects. See, e.g., Robertson v. Methow\nValley Citizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 358–359 (1989)\n(forests); Ehlert v. United States, 402 U. S. 99, 104–105\n(1971) (Selective Service); INS v. Stanisic, 395 U. S. 62, 72\n(1969) (deportation); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U. S. 1, 16–17\n(1965) (oil and gas leases). It has even been applied to an\nagency’s interpretation of another agency’s regulations.\nSee Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc., 501 U. S. 680, 696–\n699 (1991). And, it has been applied to an agency inter-\npretation that was inconsistent with a previous interpre-\ntation of the same regulation. See Long Island Care at\nHome, Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 170–171 (2007). It has\nbeen applied to formal and informal interpretations alike,\nincluding those taken during litigation. See Auer v. Rob-\nbins, 519 U. S. 452, 462 (1997). Its reasoning has also\nbeen extended outside the context of traditional agency\nregulations into the realm of criminal sentencing. See\nStinson v. United States, 508 U. S. 36, 44–45 (1993) (con-\ncluding that the Sentencing Commission’s commentary on\nits Guidelines is analogous to an agency interpretation of\nits own regulations, entitled to Seminole Rock deference).\n   The Court has even applied the doctrine to an agency\ninterpretation of a regulation cast in such vague aspira-\ntional terms as to have no substantive content. See\n——————\n  1 Although the Court has appeared to treat our agency deference\n\nregimes as precedents entitled to stare decisis effect, some scholars\nhave noted that they might instead be classified as interpretive tools.\nSee, e.g., C. Nelson, Statutory Interpretation 701 (2011). Such tools\nmight not be entitled to such effect. Because resolution of that issue is\nnot necessary to my conclusion here, I leave it for another day.\n4             PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nThomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 512–513\n(1994); see also id., at 518 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   On this steady march toward deference, the Court only\nonce expressly declined to apply Seminole Rock deference\non the ground that the agency’s interpretation was plainly\nerroneous.2 In that case, we were faced with the predict-\nable consequence of this line of precedents: An agency\nsought deference to an opinion letter that interpreted a\npermissive regulation as mandatory. See Christensen v.\nHarris County, 529 U. S. 576, 588 (2000). We rejected that\nrequest for deference as an effort, “under the guise of\ninterpreting a regulation, to create de facto a new regula-\ntion.” Ibid. This narrow limit on the broad deference\ngiven the agency interpretations, though sound, could not\nsave a doctrine that was constitutionally infirm from the\nstart. Seminole Rock was constitutionally suspect from\nthe start, and this Court’s repeated extensions of it have\nonly magnified the effects and the attendant concerns.\n\n——————\n   2 The Court has also twice expressly found Seminole Rock deference\n\ninapplicable for other reasons. Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham\nCorp., 567 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (slip op., at 13–14) (“[W]here, as\nhere, an agency’s announcement of its interpretation is preceded by a\nvery lengthy period of conspicuous inaction, the potential for unfair\nsurprise is acute. . . . [W]hatever the general merits of Auer deference,\nit is unwarranted here”); Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 256–257\n(2006) (“In our view Auer and the standard of deference it accords to an\nagency are inapplicable here. . . . The language the Interpretive Rule\naddresses comes from Congress, not the Attorney General, and the near\nequivalence of the statute and regulation belies the Government’s\nargument for Auer deference”).\n   Occasionally, Members of this Court have argued in separate writ-\nings that the Court failed appropriately to apply Seminole Rock defer-\nence, but in none of those cases did the majority opinions of the Court\nexpressly refuse to do so. See Ballard v. Commissioner, 544 U. S. 40\n(2005); Allentown Mack Sales & Service, Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U. S. 359\n(1998); Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs v.

Although this Court has\nrepeatedly invoked the “separation of powers” and “the\nconstitutional system of checks and balances” as core\nprinciples of our constitutional design, essential to the\nprotection of individual liberty, see, e.g., Stern v. Marshall,\n564 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 16–17) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), it has also endorsed a “more\npragmatic, flexible approach” to that design when it has\nseemed more convenient to permit the powers to be mixed,\nsee, e.g., Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433\nU. S. 425, 442 (1977). As the history shows, that approach\nruns the risk of compromising our constitutional\nstructure.\n                              A\n   The Constitution’s particular blend of separated powers\nand checks and balances was informed by centuries of\npolitical thought and experiences. See M. Vile, Constitu-\ntionalism and the Separation of Powers 38, 168–169 (2d\ned. 1998) (Vile). Though the theories of the separation of\npowers and checks and balances have roots in the ancient\nworld, events of the 17th and 18th centuries played a\ncrucial role in their development and informed the men\nwho crafted and ratified the Constitution.\n   Over a century before our War of Independence, the\nEnglish Civil War catapulted the theory of the separation\nof powers to prominence. As political theorists of the day\nwitnessed the conflict between the King and Parliament,\nand the dangers of tyrannical government posed by each,\nthey began to call for a clear division of authority between\nthe two. Id., at 44–45, 48–49. A 1648 work titled The\nRoyalist’s Defence offered perhaps the first extended\naccount of the theory of the separation of powers:\n“[W]hilst the Supreamacy, the Power to Judge the Law,\n6           PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nand Authority to make new Lawes, are kept in severall\nhands, the known Law is preserved, but united, it is van-\nished, instantly thereupon, and Arbytrary and Tyrannicall\npower is introduced.” The Royalist’s Defence 80 (1648)\n(italics in original).\n   John Locke and Baron de Montesquieu endorsed and\nexpanded on this concept. See Vile 63–64. They agreed\nwith the general theory set forth in The Royalist’s De-\nfence, emphasizing the need for a separation of powers to\nprotect individual liberty. J. Locke, Second Treatise of\nCivil Government §§143–144, p. 72 (J. Gough ed. 1947);\nMontesquieu, Spirit of the Laws bk. XI, ch. 6, pp. 151–152\n(O. Piest ed., T. Nugent transl. 1949). But they also advo-\ncated a system of checks and balances to reinforce that\nseparation. Vile 72–73, 102. For instance, they agreed\nthat the executive should have the power to assemble and\ndismiss the legislature and to consent to laws passed by it.\nSee Locke, supra, §§151, 156, at 75, 77–78; Montesquieu,\nSpirit of the Laws, at 157, 159. Montesquieu warned that\n“power should be a check to power” lest the legislature\n“arrogate to itself what authority it pleased . . . [and] soon\ndestroy all the other powers.” Id., at 150, 157.\n   The experience of the States during the period between\nthe War of Independence and the ratification of the Con-\nstitution confirmed the wisdom of combining these theo-\nries. Although many State Constitutions of the time\nincluded language unequivocally endorsing the separation\nof powers, they did not secure that separation with checks\nand balances, Vile 147, and actively placed traditional\nexecutive and judicial functions in the legislature,\nG. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776–\n1787, pp. 155–156 (1969). Under these arrangements,\nstate legislatures arrogated power to themselves and\nbegan to confiscate property, approve the printing of paper\nmoney, and suspend the ordinary means for the recovery\n                    Cite as: 575 U.

Id., at 403–409.3\n   When the Framers met for the Constitutional Conven-\ntion, they understood the need for greater checks and\nbalances to reinforce the separation of powers. As Madi-\nson remarked, “experience has taught us a distrust” of the\nseparation of powers alone as “a sufficient security to each\n[branch] [against] encroachments of the others.” 2 Re-\ncords of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 77 (M. Farrand\nrev. 1966). “[I]t is necessary to introduce such a balance of\npowers and interests, as will guarantee the provisions on\npaper.” Ibid. The Framers thus separated the three main\npowers of Government—legislative, executive, and judi-\ncial—into the three branches created by Articles I, II, and\nIII. But they also created checks and balances to reinforce\nthat separation. For example, they gave Congress specific\nenumerated powers to enact legislation, Art. I, §8, but\ngave the President the power to veto that legislation,\nsubject to congressional override by a supermajority vote,\nArt. I, §7, cls. 2, 3. They gave the President the power to\nappoint principal officers of the United States, but gave\nthe Senate the power to give advice and consent to those\nappointments. Art. II, §2, cl. 2. They gave the House and\nSenate the power to agree to adjourn for more than three\ndays, Art. I, §5, cl. 4, but gave the President the power, “in\nCase of Disagreement between them,” to adjourn the\nCongress “to such Time as he shall think proper.” Art. II,\n§3, cl. 3. During the ratification debates, Madison argued\nthat this structure represented “the great security” for\nliberty in the Constitution. The Federalist No. 51, p. 321\n——————\n   3 The practices of the time can perhaps best be summarized by the\n\nfollowing commentary from a contemporaneous magazine: “[S]o many\nlegal infractions of sacred right—so many public invasions of private\nproperty—so many wanton abuses of legislative powers!” Giles Hickory\n(Noah Webster), Government, The American Magazine, Mar. 1788, p.\n206.\n8           PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison).\n  To the Framers, the separation of powers and checks\nand balances were more than just theories. They were\npractical and real protections for individual liberty in the\nnew Constitution. See Mistretta v. United States, 488\nU. S. 361, 426 (1989) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[The Con-\nstitution] is a prescribed structure, a framework, for the\nconduct of government. In designing that structure, the\nFramers themselves considered how much commingling [of\ngovernmental powers] was, in the generality of things,\nacceptable, and set forth their conclusions in the docu-\nment”).    The Judiciary—no less than the other two\nbranches—has an obligation to guard against deviations\nfrom those principles. The Seminole Rock line of prece-\ndent is one such deviation.\n                             B\n  Seminole Rock raises two related constitutional con-\ncerns. It represents a transfer of judicial power to the\nExecutive Branch, and it amounts to an erosion of the\njudicial obligation to serve as a “check” on the political\nbranches.\n                              1\n  When a party properly brings a case or controversy to\nan Article III court, that court is called upon to exercise\nthe “judicial Power of the United States.” Art. III, §1. For\nthe reasons I explain in this section, the judicial power, as\noriginally understood, requires a court to exercise its\nindependent judgment in interpreting and expounding\nupon the laws.\n  Those who ratified the Constitution knew that legal\ntexts would often contain ambiguities. See generally\nMolot, The Judicial Perspective in the Administrative\nState: Reconciling Modern Doctrines of Deference with the\nJudiciary’s Structural Role, 53 Stan. L. Rev. 1, 20–21, and\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

As\nJames Madison explained, “All new laws, though penned\nwith the greatest technical skill and passed on the fullest\nand most mature deliberation, are considered as more or\nless obscure and equivocal . . . .” The Federalist No. 37,\nat 229.\n   The judicial power was understood to include the power\nto resolve these ambiguities over time. See ibid. Alexan-\nder Hamilton lauded this power, arguing that “[t]he inter-\npretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of\nthe courts.” Id., No. 78, at 467. It is undoubtedly true\nthat the other branches of Government have the authority\nand obligation to interpret the law, but only the judicial\ninterpretation would be considered authoritative in a\njudicial proceeding. Vile 360.\n   Although the Federalists and Anti-Federalists engaged\nin a public debate about this interpretive power, that\ndebate centered on the dangers inherent in the power, not\non its allocation under the Constitution. See, e.g., Letters\nfrom The Federal Farmer XV (Jan. 18, 1788), in 2 The\nComplete Anti-Federalist 315–316 (H. Storing ed. 1981)\n(arguing that the interpretive power made the Judiciary\nthe most dangerous branch). Writing as “Brutus,” one\nleading anti-Federalist argued that judges “w[ould] not\nconfine themselves to any fixed or established rules, but\nw[ould] determine, according to what appears to them, the\nreason and spirit of the constitution.” Essays of Brutus\n(Jan. 31, 1788), in 2 id., at 420. The Federalists rejected\nthese arguments, assuring the public that judges would be\nguided “by strict rules and precedents which serve to\ndefine and point out their duty in every particular case\nthat comes before them.” The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (A.\nHamilton). Those rules included principles of interpreta-\ntion that had been set out by jurists for centuries. See,\ne.g., 2 S. von Pufendorf, De Officio Hominis Et Civis Juxta\n10          PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nLegem Naturalem Libri Duo 83–86 (1682) (F. Moore\ntransl. 1927); see also 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on\nthe Laws of England 59–61 (1765).\n   One of the key elements of the Federalists’ arguments in\nsupport of the allocation of power to make binding inter-\npretations of the law was that Article III judges would\nexercise independent judgment. Although “judicial inde-\npendence” is often discussed in terms of independence\nfrom external threats, the Framers understood the concept\nto also require independence from the “internal threat” of\n“human will.” P. Hamburger, Law and Judicial Duty 507,\n508 (2008); see also The Federalist No. 78, at 465 (A.\nHamilton) (“The judiciary . . . may truly be said to have\nneither FORCE nor WILL but merely judgment . . . ”).\nIndependent judgment required judges to decide cases in\naccordance with the law of the land, not in accordance\nwith pressures placed upon them through either internal\nor external sources. Internal sources might include per-\nsonal biases, while external sources might include pres-\nsure from the political branches, the public, or other\ninterested parties. See Hamburger, supra, at 508–521.\n   The Framers made several key decisions at the Conven-\ntion with these pressures in mind. For example, they\nrejected proposals to include a federal council of revision\nafter several participants at the Convention expressed\nconcern that judicial involvement in such a council would\nfoster internal biases. Rufus King of Maryland, for exam-\nple, asserted that “the Judges ought to be able to expound\nthe law as it should come before them, free from the bias\nof having participated in its formation.” 1 Records of the\nFederal Convention of 1787, at 98. Alexander Hamilton\nrepeated these concerns in The Federalist, arguing that\n“the judges, who are to be interpreters of the law, might\nreceive an improper bias from having given a previous\nopinion in their revisionary capacities” or “be induced to\nembark too far in the political views of [the Executive]”\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfrom too much association with him. The Federalist No.\n73, at 446; see also Hamburger, supra, at 508–512.\n   The Framers also created structural protections in the\nConstitution to free judges from external influences. They\nprovided, for example, that judges should “hold their\nOffices during good Behaviour” and receive “a Compensa-\ntion, which shall not be diminished during their Continu-\nance in Office.” Art. III, §1. Hamilton noted that such\nunequivocal language had been shown necessary by the\nexperience of the States, where similar state constitutional\nprotections for judges had not been “sufficiently definite\nto preclude legislative evasions” of the separation of the\njudicial power. The Federalist No. 79, at 472. Because\n“power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over\nhis will,” he argued that Article III’s structural protections\nwould help ensure that judges fulfilled their constitutional\nrole. Ibid. (emphasis deleted).\n   The Framers made the opposite choice for legislators\nand the Executive. Instead of insulating them from exter-\nnal pressures, the Constitution tied them to those pres-\nsures. It provided for election of Members of the House of\nRepresentatives every two years, Art. I, §2, cl. 1; and\nselection of Members of the Senate every six years, Art. I,\n§3, cl. 1. It also provided for the President to be subject to\nelection every four years. Art. II, §1, cl. 1. “The President\nis [thus] directly dependent on the people, and since there\nis only one President, he is responsible. The people know\nwhom to blame . . . .” See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S.\n654, 729 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). To preserve that\naccountability, we have held that executive officers must\nbe subject to removal by the President to ensure account-\nability within the Executive Branch. See Free Enterprise\nFund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561\nU. S. 477, 495 (2010); see also Morrison, supra, at 709\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.) (“It is not for us to determine, and\nwe have never presumed to determine, how much of the\n12             PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\npurely executive powers of government must be within the\nfull control of the President. The Constitution prescribes\nthat they all are”).\n   Given these structural distinctions between the branches,\nit is no surprise that judicial interpretations are defini-\ntive in cases and controversies before the courts. Courts\nact as “an intermediate body between the people and the\nlegislature, in order, among other things, to keep the\nlatter within the limits assigned to their authority.” Fed-\neralist No. 78, at 467 (A. Hamilton). The Legislature and\nExecutive may be swayed by popular sentiment to aban-\ndon the strictures of the Constitution or other rules of law.\nBut the Judiciary, insulated from both internal and exter-\nnal sources of bias, is duty bound to exercise independent\njudgment in applying the law.\n   Interpreting agency regulations calls for that exercise of\nindependent judgment. Substantive regulations have the\nforce and effect of law. See, e.g., United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 231–232 (2001).4 Agencies and pri-\n——————\n   4 These cases also raise constitutional questions about the distinction\n\nin administrative law between “substantive” (or “legislative”) and\ninterpretative rules. The United States Court of Appeals for the D. C.\nCircuit has defined a legislative rule as “[a]n agency action that pur-\nports to impose legally binding obligations or prohibitions on regulated\nparties” and an interpretative rule as “[a]n agency action that merely\ninterprets a prior statute or regulation, and does not itself purport to\nimpose new obligations or prohibitions or requirements on regulated\nparties.” National Mining Assn. v. McCarthy, 758 F. 3d 243, 251–252\n(2014). And our precedents make clear that administrative agencies\nmust exercise only executive power in promulgating these rules.\nArlington v. FCC, 569 U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2013) (slip op., at 13, n. 4).\nBut while it is easy to see the promulgation of interpretative rules as\nan “executive” function—executive officials necessarily interpret the\nlaws they enforce—it is difficult to see what authority the President\nhas “to impose legally binding obligations or prohibitions on regulated\nparties.” That definition suggests something much closer to the legisla-\ntive power, which our Constitution does not permit the Executive to\nexercise in this manner. Because these troubling questions are not\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

See, e.g., Christopher v.\nSmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012)\n(slip op., at 6–7) (private party relying on Department of\nLabor regulations); FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,\n567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (agency issuing\nnotices of liability under regulations). Just as it is critical\nfor judges to exercise independent judgment in applying\nstatutes, it is critical for judges to exercise independent\njudgment in determining that a regulation properly covers\nthe conduct of regulated parties. Defining the legal mean-\ning of the regulation is one aspect of that determination.\n   Seminole Rock deference, however, precludes judges\nfrom independently determining that meaning. Rather\nthan judges’ applying recognized tools of interpretation to\ndetermine the best meaning of a regulation, this doctrine\ndemands that courts accord “controlling weight” to the\nagency interpretation of a regulation, subject only to the\nnarrow exception for interpretations that are plainly\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. That defer-\nence amounts to a transfer of the judge’s exercise of inter-\npretive judgment to the agency. See 1 S. Johnson, Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 499 (4th ed. 1773)\n(defining “[d]efer” as “to leave to another’s judgment”).\nBut the agency, as part of the Executive Branch, lacks the\nstructural protections for independent judgment adopted\nby the Framers, including the life tenure and salary pro-\ntections of Article III. Because the agency is thus not\nproperly constituted to exercise the judicial power under\nthe Constitution, the transfer of interpretive judgment\nraises serious separation-of-powers concerns.\n\n\n—————— \n\ndirectly implicated here, I leave them for another case. See Department \n\nof Transportation v. Association of American Railroads, ante, at 19–22\n\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n\n14          PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                               2\n   Seminole Rock is constitutionally questionable for an\nadditional reason: It undermines the judicial “check” on\nthe political branches. Unlike the Legislative and Execu-\ntive Branches, each of which possesses several political\nchecks on the other, the Judiciary has one primary check\non the excesses of political branches. That check is the\nenforcement of the rule of law through the exercise of\njudicial power.\n   Judges have long recognized their responsibility to\napply the law, even if they did not conceive of it as a\n“check” on political power. During the 17th century, for\nexample, King James I sought to pressure Chief Justice\nCoke to affirm the lawfulness of his efforts to raise reve-\nnue without the participation of Parliament. Hamburger,\nLaw and Judicial Duty, at 200–201. Coke sought time to\nconfer with his fellow jurists to “make an advised answer\naccording to law and reason.” Case of Proclamations, 12\nCo. Rep. 74, 75, 77 Eng. Rep. 1352, 1353 (K. B. 1611). But\nthe King’s representative, Lord Chancellor Ellesmere,\nresponded that “he would advise the Judges to maintain\nthe power and prerogative of the King” and suggested\nthat, “in cases in which there is no authority and prece-\ndent,” the judiciary should “leave it to the King to order in\nit according to his wisdom.” Ibid. Coke famously re-\nsponded, “[T]he King cannot change any part of the com-\nmon law, nor create any offence by his proclamation,\nwhich was not an offence before, without Parliament.”\nIbid. When James I later attempted to do just that, Coke\ndeclared the proclamations “ ‘utterly against Law and\nreason, and for that void.’ ” Hamburger, supra, at 202.\n   The Framers expected Article III judges to engage in\nsimilar efforts, by applying the law as a “check” on the\nexcesses of both the Legislative and Executive Branches.\nSee, e.g., 3 J. Elliot, Debates in the Several Conventions\non the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 553 (1863) (J.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

They would\ndeclare it void”); see also Vile 174. The Framers “contem-\nplated [the Constitution], as a rule for the government of\ncourts, as well as of the legislature.” Marbury v. Madison,\n1 Cranch 137, 179–180 (1803). Thus, if a case involved a\nconflict between a law and the Constitution, judges would\nhave a duty “to adhere to the latter and disregard the\nformer.” The Federalist No. 78, at 468 (A. Hamilton); see\nalso Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 178. Similarly, if a case in-\nvolved an executive effort to extend a law beyond its\nmeaning, judges would have a duty to adhere to the law\nthat had been properly promulgated under the Constitu-\ntion. Cf. id., at 157–158 (considering the scope of the\nPresident’s constitutional power of appointment). As this\nCourt said long ago, “[T]he particular phraseology of the\nconstitution of the United States confirms and strengthens\nthe principle, supposed to be essential to all written con-\nstitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void;\nand that courts, as well as other departments, are bound\nby that instrument.” Id., at 180.\n   Article III judges cannot opt out of exercising their\ncheck. As we have long recognized, “[t]he Judiciary has a\nresponsibility to decide cases properly before it, even those\nit ‘would gladly avoid.’ ” Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S.\n___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5) (quoting Cohens v. Virginia,\n6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821)). This responsibility applies not\nonly to constitutional challenges to particular statutes,\nsee, e.g., Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(slip op., at 2), including those based on the separation of\npowers, Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.

S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\nop., at 10). In each case, the Judiciary is called upon to\nexercise its independent judgment and apply the law.\n  But we have not consistently exercised the judicial\ncheck with respect to administrative agencies. Even\nthough regulated parties have repeatedly challenged\nagency interpretations as inconsistent with existing regu-\nlations, we have just as repeatedly declined to exercise\nindependent judgment as to those claims. Instead, we\nhave deferred to the executive agency that both promul-\ngated the regulations and enforced them. Although an\nagency’s interpretation of a regulation might be the best\ninterpretation, it also might not. When courts refuse even\nto decide what the best interpretation is under the law,\nthey abandon the judicial check. That abandonment\npermits precisely the accumulation of governmental pow-\ners that the Framers warned against. See The Federalist\nNo. 47, at 302 (J. Madison).\n                             C\n   This accumulation of governmental powers allows agen-\ncies to change the meaning of regulations at their discre-\ntion and without any advance notice to the parties. It is\nprecisely this problem that the United States Court of\nAppeals for the D. C. Circuit attempted to address by\nrequiring agencies to undertake notice and comment\nprocedures before substantially revising definitive inter-\npretations of regulations. Paralyzed Veterans, supra.\nThough legally erroneous, the Court of Appeals’ reasoning\nwas practically sound. When courts give “controlling\nweight” to an administrative interpretation of a regula-\ntion—instead of to the best interpretation of it—they\neffectively give the interpretation—and not the regula-\ntion—the force and effect of law. To regulated parties, the\nnew interpretation might as well be a new regulation.\n                    Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                17\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   These cases provide a classic example of the problem.\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 establishes federal\nminimum wage and overtime requirements, but exempts\nfrom these requirements “any employee engaged in a bona\nfide executive, administrative, or professional capac-\nity . . . , or in the capacity of outside salesman (as such\nterms are defined and delimited from time to time by\nregulations of the Secretary).” 29 U. S. C. §213(a)(1). The\nDepartment of Labor has accordingly promulgated regula-\ntions providing that “an employee whose primary duty is\nselling financial products does not qualify for the adminis-\ntrative exemption.” 29 CFR §541.203(b) (2015).\n   Unsure whether certain mortgage-loan officers qualified\nas employees whose primary duty is selling financial\nproducts, the Mortgage Bankers Association asked the\nDepartment of Labor for advice. In 2006, the Department\nconcluded that the officers are not employees whose pri-\nmary duty is selling financial products. But in 2010, the\nDepartment reversed course, concluding exactly the oppo-\nsite. If courts accord “controlling weight” to both the 2006\nand 2010 interpretations, the regulated entities are sub-\nject to two opposite legal rules imposed under the same\nregulation.\n   This practice turns on its head the principle that the\nUnited States is “a government of laws, and not of men.”\nMarbury, supra, at 163. Regulations provide notice to\nregulated parties in only a limited sense because their\nmeaning will ultimately be determined by agencies rather\nthan by the “strict rules and precedents” to which Alexan-\nder Hamilton once referred.5\n——————\n  5 The notice problem is exacerbated by agency departures from the\n\nprocedures established for rulemaking in the APA. Although almost all\nrulemaking is today accomplished through informal notice and com-\nment, the APA actually contemplated a much more formal process for\nmost rulemaking. To that end, it provided for elaborate trial-like\nhearings in which proponents of particular rules would introduce\n18            PEREZ v.

None is\npersuasive.\n                             A\n   Probably the most oft-recited justification for Seminole\nRock deference is that of agency expertise in administer-\ning technical statutory schemes. Under this justification,\ndeference to administrative agencies is necessary when a\n“regulation concerns ‘a complex and highly technical regu-\nlatory program’ in which the identification and classifica-\ntion of relevant ‘criteria necessarily require significant\nexpertise and entail the exercise of judgment grounded in\npolicy concerns.’ ” Thomas Jefferson Univ., 512 U. S., at\n512.\n   This defense of Seminole Rock deference misidentifies\nthe relevant inquiry. The proper question faced by courts\nin interpreting a regulation is not what the best policy\nchoice might be, but what the regulation means. Because\nthis Court has concluded that “substantive agency regula-\ntions have the ‘force and effect of law,’ ” Chrysler Corp. v.\n\n——————\nevidence and bear the burden of proof in support of those proposed\nrules. See 5 U. S. C. §556.\n  Today, however, formal rulemaking is the Yeti of administrative law.\nThere are isolated sightings of it in the ratemaking context, but else-\nwhere it proves elusive. It is somewhat ironic for the Court so ada-\nmantly to insist that agencies be subject to no greater procedures than\nthose required by the APA when we have not been adamant in requir-\ning agencies to comply with even those baseline procedures. See United\nStates v. Florida East Coast R. Co., 410 U. S. 224, 237–238 (1973)\n(concluding that the APA’s formal procedures, which were to apply\n“[w]hen rules are required by statute to be made on the record after\nopportunity for an agency hearing,” §553(c), were not triggered by a\nstatute that permitted an agency to engage in rulemaking only “ ‘after\n[a] hearing’ ”).\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   19\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nBrown, 441 U. S. 281, 295 (1979), such regulations should\nbe interpreted like any other law. Thus, we should “as-\nsum[e] that the ordinary meaning of the regulation’s\nlanguage expresses” its purpose and enforce it “according\nto its terms.” See Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins.\nCo., 560 U. S. 242, 251 (2010) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Judges are at least as well suited as administra-\ntive agencies to engage in this task. Cf. Marbury, 1\nCranch, at 177 (“It is emphatically the province and duty\nof the judicial department to say what the law is”). In-\ndeed, judges are frequently called upon to interpret the\nmeaning of legal texts and are able to do so even when\nthose texts involve technical language. See, e.g., Barber v.\nGonzales, 347 U. S. 637, 640–643 (1954) (interpreting\ndeportation statute according to technical meaning).\n   Fundamentally, the argument about agency expertise is\nless about the expertise of agencies in interpreting lan-\nguage than it is about the wisdom of according agencies\nbroad flexibility to administer statutory schemes.6 “But\n——————\n   6 Many decisions of this Court invoke agency expertise as a justifica-\n\ntion for deference. This argument has its root in the support for admin-\nistrative agencies that developed during the Progressive Era in this\ncountry. The Era was marked by a move from the individualism that\nhad long characterized American society to the concept of a society\norganized for collective action. See A. Link, Woodrow Wilson and the\nProgressive Era 1910–1917, p. 1 (1954). That move also reflected a\ndeep disdain for the theory of popular sovereignty. As Woodrow Wilson\nwrote before he attained the presidency, “Our peculiar American\ndifficulty in organizing administration is not the danger of losing\nliberty, but the danger of not being able or willing to separate its\nessentials from its accidents. Our success is made doubtful by that\nbesetting error of ours, the error of trying to do too much by vote.”\nWilson, The Study of Administration, 2 Pol. Sci. Q. 197, 214 (1887). In\nPresident Wilson’s view, public criticism would be beneficial in the\nformation of overall policy, but “a clumsy nuisance” in the daily life of\nGovernment—“a rustic handling delicate machinery.” Id., at 215.\nReflecting this belief that bureaucrats might more effectively govern\nthe country than the American people, the progressives ushered in\n20            PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\npolicy arguments supporting even useful ‘political inven-\ntions’ are subject to the demands of the Constitution which\ndefines powers and . . . sets out . . . how those powers are\nto be exercised.” INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 945\n(1983). Even in the face of a perceived necessity, the\nConstitution protects us from ourselves. New York v.\nUnited States, 505 U. S. 144, 187–188 (1992).\n                               B\n   Another oft-recited justification for Seminole Rock def-\nerence is that agencies are better situated to define the\noriginal intent behind their regulations. See Martin v.\nOccupational Safety and Health Review Comm’n, 499 U. S.\n144, 152–153 (1991). Under this justification, “[b]ecause\nthe Secretary [of Labor] promulgates th[e] standards, the\nSecretary is in a better position . . . to reconstruct the\npurpose of the regulations in question.” Id., at 152.\n   This justification rings hollow. This Court has afforded\nSeminole Rock deference to agency interpretations even\nwhen the agency was not the original drafter. See Pauley,\n501 U. S., at 696–698 (applying Seminole Rock deference\nto one agency’s interpretation of another agency’s regula-\ntions because Congress had delegated authority to both to\nadminister the program). It has likewise granted Semi-\nnole Rock deference to agency interpretations that are\ninconsistent with interpretations adopted closer in time to\nthe promulgation of the regulations. See, e.g., Long Island\nCare at Home, 551 U. S., at 170–171.\n   Even if the scope of Seminole Rock deference more\nclosely matched the original-drafter justification, it would\nstill fail. It is the text of the regulations that have the\nforce and effect of law, not the agency’s intent. “Citizens\n——————\nsignificant expansions of the administrative state, ultimately culminat-\ning in the New Deal. See generally M. Keller, Regulating a New\nEconomy: Public Policy and Economic Change in America, 1900–1933\n(1990).\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

No.\n89 v. Department of Education, 550 U. S. 81, 119 (2007)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Cf. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.\n555, 586–587 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)\n(noting that only “federal standards . . . that are set forth\nin, or necessarily follow from, the statutory text that was\nproduced through the constitutionally required bicameral\nand presentment procedures”—not Congress’ “purposes\nand objectives”—can become the “law of the land”). “To be\ngoverned by legislated text rather than legislators’ inten-\ntions is what it means to be ‘a Government of laws, not of\nmen.’ ” Zuni Public School Dist. No. 89, supra, at 119\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Only the text of a regulation goes\nthrough the procedures established by Congress for agency\nrulemaking. And it is that text on which the public is\nentitled to rely. For the same reasons that we should not\naccord controlling weight to postenactment expressions of\nintent by individual Members of Congress, see Sullivan v.\nFinkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 631–632 (1990) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part), we should not accord controlling\nweight to expressions of intent by administrators of\nagencies.\n                               C\n   A third asserted justification for Seminole Rock defer-\nence is that Congress has delegated to agencies the au-\nthority to interpret their own regulations. See, e.g., Mar-\ntin, 499 U. S., at 151. The theory is that, “[b]ecause\napplying an agency’s regulation to complex or changing\ncircumstances calls upon the agency’s unique expertise\nand policymaking prerogatives, . . . the power authorita-\ntively to interpret its own regulations is a component of\nthe agency’s delegated lawmaking powers.” Ibid.\n   This justification fails because Congress lacks authority\n22          PEREZ v. MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSN.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nto delegate the power. As we have explained in an analo-\ngous context, “[t]he structure of the Constitution does not\npermit Congress to execute the laws; it follows that Con-\ngress cannot grant to an officer under its control what it\ndoes not possess.” Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 726\n(1986). Similarly, the Constitution does not empower\nCongress to issue a judicially binding interpretation of the\nConstitution or its laws. Lacking the power itself, it can-\nnot delegate that power to an agency.\n   To hold otherwise would be to vitiate the separation of\npowers and ignore the “sense of a sharp necessity to sepa-\nrate the legislative from the judicial power . . . [that]\ntriumphed among the Framers of the new Federal Consti-\ntution.” Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211,\n221 (1995). As this Court has explained, the “essential\nbalance” of the Constitution is that the Legislature is\n“possessed of power to ‘prescrib[e] the rules by which the\nduties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated,’ but\nthe power of ‘[t]he interpretation of the laws’ [is] ‘the\nproper and peculiar province of the courts.’ ” Id., at 222\n(citation omitted; third brackets added). Although the\nConstitution imposes a duty on all three branches to\ninterpret the laws within their own spheres, the power to\ncreate legally binding interpretations rests with the Judi-\nciary. See Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 177, 179–180.\n                              D\n  A final proposed justification for Seminole Rock defer-\nence is that too much oversight of administrative matters\nwould imperil the “independence and esteem” of judges.\nSee, e.g., Charles Evans Hughes, Speech before the Elmira\nChamber of Commerce, May 3, 1907, in Addresses of\nCharles Evans Hughes, 1906–1916, p. 185 (2d ed. 1916).\nThe argument goes that questions of administration are\nthose which “lie close to the public impatience,” id., at 186,\nand thus the courts’ resolution of such questions could\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           23\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n“expose them to the fire of public criticism,” id., at 187.\n   But this argument, which boils down to a policy judg-\nment of questionable validity, cannot vitiate the constitu-\ntional allocation of powers. The Judicial Branch is sepa-\nrate from the political branches for a reason: It has the\nobligation to apply the law to cases and controversies that\ncome before it, and concerns about the popular esteem of\nindividual judges—or even the Judiciary as a whole—have\nno place in that analysis. Our system of Government\ncould not long survive absent adherence to the written\nConstitution that formed it.\n                         *     *     *\n   Although on the surface these cases require only a\nstraightforward application of the APA, closer scrutiny\nreveals serious constitutional questions lurking beneath. I\nhave “acknowledge[d] the importance of stare decisis to the\nstability of our Nation’s legal system.” “But stare decisis is\nonly an ‘adjunct’ of our duty as judges to decide by our best\nlights what the Constitution means.” McDonald v. Chicago,\n561 U. S. 742, 812 (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment) (citation omitted). By\nmy best lights, the entire line of precedent beginning with\nSeminole Rock raises serious constitutional questions and\nshould be reconsidered in an appropriate case.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2784695/", "sha1": "0fb2dccb60673dc5ed00afac7407c73a083f240c", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-03-09T08:01:08.663755"}
