TEXAS\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF \n\n              CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TEXAS\n\n              No. 14–292.   Decided March 23, 2015\n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting from the denial of\ncertiorari.\n  On April 28, 1984, petitioner Lester Leroy Bower was\nconvicted in a Texas court of murdering four men. Each of\nthe four men had been shot multiple times. Their bodies\nwere left in an airplane hangar, and an ultralight aircraft\nwas missing.\n  The State sought the death penalty. Bower introduced\nevidence that was, in his view, mitigating. He noted that\nhe was 36 years old, married, employed full-time, and a\nfather of two. He had no prior criminal record. Through\nthe testimony of Bower’s family members and friends, the\njury also heard about Bower’s religious devotion, his com­\nmitment to his family, his community service, his concern\nfor others, his even temperament, and his lack of any\nprevious violent (or criminal) behavior.\n  At the time of Bower’s sentencing, Texas law permitted\nthe jury to consider this mitigating evidence only insofar\nas it was relevant to three “special issues”: (1) whether the\nconduct of the defendant that caused the death of the four\nvictims was committed deliberately and with the reason-\nable expectation that the victims’ deaths would result; (2)\nwhether there was a probability that the defendant would\ncontinue to commit violent criminal acts, and as such\nwould be a continuing threat to society; and (3) whether\nthe defendant acted in response to provocation. See Tex.\nCode Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071(b) (Vernon 1981 and\n2                    BOWER v. TEXAS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCum. Supp. 1986). Since the third issue was irrelevant in\nBower’s case, the court asked the jury to consider only the\nfirst two. Because the jury answered “yes” to both, the\ntrial judge automatically imposed a death sentence, as\nrequired by then-controlling Texas law. Arts. 37.071(c)–\n(e).\n   Bower appealed his case, lost, sought state postconvic­\ntion relief, lost, appealed that loss, and lost again. See\nBower v. Texas, 769 S. W. 2d 887 (Tex. Crim. App.), cert.\ndenied, 492 U. S. 927 (1989); Ex parte Bower, 823 S. W. 2d\n284 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 835\n(1992). But a week before Bower’s conviction became\nfinal, this Court decided in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S.\n302 (1989), that Texas’ special issues procedure was un­\nconstitutional. Specifically, the Court held that Texas’\nprocedure impermissibly prevented the jury from consider­\ning or acting upon potentially mitigating evidence. The\nCourt wrote that a State cannot\n    “consistent with the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend­\n    ments, prevent the sentencer from considering and\n    giving effect to evidence relevant to the defendant’s\n    background or character or to the circumstances of the\n    offense that mitigate against imposing the death pen­\n    alty.” Id., at 318.\n   Penry himself had offered evidence of mental retarda­\ntion and childhood abuse. This Court decided that Texas’\nspecial issues, while allowing the jury to decide if Penry\nmight commit violent crimes in the future, did not give the\njury the constitutionally requisite opportunity to consider\nwhether Penry’s mental retardation or childhood abuse\nconstituted significantly mitigating evidence regardless.\nIt “is not enough,” the Court wrote,\n    “simply to allow the defendant to present mitigating\n    evidence to the sentencer. The sentencer must also be\n    able to consider and give effect to that evidence in im­\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    posing [a] sentence. Only then can [the court] be sure\n    that the sentencer has treated the defendant as a\n    uniquely individual human bein[g] and has made a re­\n    liable determination that death is the appropriate\n    sentence.” Id., at 319 (citations and internal quota­\n    tion marks omitted; last alteration in original).\n   After this Court decided Penry, Bower filed a petition for\nhabeas corpus in Federal District Court. He argued,\namong other things, that, given Penry, his own sentencing\nproceeding was constitutionally deficient. After a hearing,\nthe court denied his petition and also refused to issue a\ncertificate of appealability on the Penry issue. The Fifth\nCircuit affirmed the District Court’s denial of a certificate\nof appealability, reasoning that, in Bower’s case, the sec­\nond special issue (about future dangerousness) sufficiently\npermitted the jury to take account of Bower’s mitigating\nevidence. Bower v. Dretke, 145 Fed. Appx. 879, 885, 887\n(2005). In doing so, the Circuit referred to several of its\nearlier decisions reaching the same conclusion in similar\ncircumstances. See ibid. (citing Coble v. Dretke, 417 F. 3d\n508 (2005); Boyd v. Johnson, 167 F. 3d 907 (1999); Bar-\nnard v. Collins, 958 F. 2d 634 (1992)). Bower then sought\ncertiorari here, but we denied his petition. Bower v.\nDretke, 546 U. S. 1140 (2006).\n   The Fifth Circuit subsequently changed its mind about\nthe meaning of Penry. And, in doing so, it specifically said\nthat it had been wrong about Bower’s Penry claim. See\nPierce v. Thaler, 604 F. 3d 197, 210, n. 9 (2010). It said\nthis not in Bower’s case, but in an unrelated one. At that\npoint, Bower’s case was no longer in federal court. So\nBower could not take advantage of the Fifth Circuit’s\nchange of mind; he had already brought a subsequent\napplication for postconviction relief in Texas court, argu­\ning (among other things) that Texas had used an unconsti­\ntutional sentencing procedure in his case.\n4                     BOWER v. TEXAS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    The Texas trial court decided that Bower was right.\nConclusions of Law ¶97 in Ex parte Bower, No. 33426–B\n(15th Jud. Dist. Ct., Grayson Cty., Dec. 10, 2012), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 127 (hereinafter Conclusions of Law). It\nissued an opinion requiring a new sentencing proceeding.\nSee ibid. But the State appealed, and the Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals reversed the trial court. See Order in\nEx parte Bower, No. WR–21005–02, etc. (Tex. Ct. Crim.\nApp., June 11, 2014), App. to Pet. for Cert. 1. It explained\nthat “unlike the double-edged evidence in Penry . . . , the\nmitigating evidence presented by [Bower] during the\npunishment phase of his trial—evidence of his good and\nnon-violent character, his good deeds, and the absence of a\nprior criminal record—was not outside the scope of special\nissues given.” Id., at 4 (citing Ex parte Bower, 823 S. W.\n2d, at 286). Because Bower’s evidence was not “double­\nedged” as Penry’s had been, the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals believed that the use of the special issues proceed­\ning in Bower’s sentencing proceeding did not constitution­\nally entitle him to resentencing. See ibid.\n    Bower now asks us to grant certiorari and to reverse the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals. In my view, we should\ndo so. Penry’s holding rested on the fact that Texas’ for­\nmer special issues did not tell the jury “what ‘to do if it\ndecided that [the defendant] . . . should not be executed’ ”\nbecause of his mitigating evidence. Abdul-Kabir v. Quar-\nterman, 550 U. S. 233, 256 (2007) (quoting Penry, supra, at\n324). Bower’s sentencing procedure suffered from this\ndefect just as Penry’s did. The distinction that the Texas\ncourt drew between Penry’s and Bower’s evidence is irrel­\nevant. Indeed, we have expressly made “clear that Penry\n. . . applies in cases involving evidence that is neither\ndouble edged nor purely aggravating, because in some\ncases a defendant’s evidence may have mitigating effect\nbeyond its ability to negate the special issues.” 550 U. S.,\nat 255, n. 16. The trial court and the Fifth Circuit both\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrecognized that Bower’s Penry claim was improperly re­\njected on that basis. See Conclusions of Law ¶97; Pierce,\nsupra, at 210, n. 9.\n   The Constitution accordingly entitles Bower to a new\nsentencing proceeding. I recognize that we do not often\nintervene only to correct a case-specific legal error. But\nthe error here is glaring, and its consequence may well be\ndeath. After all, because Bower already filed an applica­\ntion for federal habeas relief raising his Penry claim, the\nlaw may bar him from filing another application raising\nthis same issue. See 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(1). In these\ncircumstances, I believe we should act and act now. I\nwould grant the petition and summarily reverse the judg­\nment below. I dissent from the Court’s decision not to\ndo so.\n</pre>", "id": 2788474, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/03/23/bower_v._texas.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 575 U.
