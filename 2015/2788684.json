Argued November 3, 2014—Decided March 24, 2015\nThe Securities Act of 1933 requires that a company wishing to issue\n  securities must first file a registration statement containing specified\n  information about the issuing company and the securities offered.\n  See 15 U. S. C. §§77g, 77aa. The registration statement may also in-\n  clude other representations of fact or opinion. To protect investors\n  and promote compliance with these disclosure requirements, §11 of\n  the Act creates two ways to hold issuers liable for a registration\n  statement’s contents: A purchaser of securities may sue an issuer if\n  the registration statement either “contain[s] an untrue statement of a\n  material fact” or “omit[s] to state a material fact . . . necessary to\n  make the statements therein not misleading.” §77k(a). In either\n  case, the buyer need not prove that the issuer acted with any intent\n  to deceive or defraud. Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S.\n  375, 381–382.\n    Petitioner Omnicare, a pharmacy services company, filed a regis-\n  tration statement in connection with a public offering of common\n  stock. In addition to the required disclosures, the registration state-\n  ment contained two statements expressing the company’s opinion\n  that it was in compliance with federal and state laws. After the Fed-\n  eral Government filed suit against Omnicare for allegedly receiving\n  kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers, respondents, pension\n  funds that purchased Omnicare stock (hereinafter Funds), sued Om-\n  nicare under §11. They claimed that Omnicare’s legal-compliance\n  statements constituted “untrue statement[s] of . . . material fact” and\n  that Omnicare “omitted to state [material] facts necessary” to make\n  those statements not misleading.\n2         OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n             CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                            Syllabus\n\n\n    The District Court granted Omnicare’s motion to dismiss. Because\n the Funds had not alleged that Omnicare’s officers knew they were\n violating the law, the court found that the Funds had failed to state a\n §11 claim. The Sixth Circuit reversed. Acknowledging that the\n statements at issue expressed opinions, the court held that no show-\n ing of subjective disbelief was required. In the court’s view, the\n Funds’ allegations that Omnicare’s legal-compliance opinions were\n objectively false sufficed to support their claim.\nHeld:\n    1. A statement of opinion does not constitute an “untrue statement\n of . . . fact” simply because the stated opinion ultimately proves incor-\n rect. The Sixth Circuit’s contrary holding wrongly conflates facts and\n opinions. A statement of fact expresses certainty about a thing,\n whereas a statement of opinion conveys only an uncertain view as to\n that thing. Section 11 incorporates that distinction in its first clause\n by exposing issuers to liability only for “untrue statement[s] of . . .\n fact.” §77k(a) (emphasis added). Because a statement of opinion ad-\n mits the possibility of error, such a statement remains true—and\n thus is not an “untrue statement of . . . fact”—even if the opinion\n turns out to have been wrong.\n    But opinion statements are not wholly immune from liability under\n §11’s first clause. Every such statement explicitly affirms one fact:\n that the speaker actually holds the stated belief. A statement of\n opinion thus qualifies as an “untrue statement of . . . fact” if that fact\n is untrue—i.e., if the opinion expressed was not sincerely held. In\n addition, opinion statements can give rise to false-statement liability\n under §11 if they contain embedded statements of untrue facts.\n Here, however, Omnicare’s sincerity is not contested and the state-\n ments at issue are pure opinion statements. The Funds thus cannot\n establish liability under §11’s first clause. Pp. 6–10.\n    2. If a registration statement omits material facts about the issu-\n er’s inquiry into, or knowledge concerning, a statement of opinion,\n and if those facts conflict with what a reasonable investor, reading\n the statement fairly and in context, would take from the statement\n itself, then §11’s omissions clause creates liability. Pp. 10–20.\n       (a) For purposes of §11’s omissions clause, whether a statement\n is “misleading” is an objective inquiry that depends on a reasonable\n investor’s perspective. Cf. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426\n U. S. 438, 445. Omnicare goes too far by claiming that no reasonable\n person, in any context, can understand a statement of opinion to con-\n vey anything more than the speaker’s own mindset. A reasonable in-\n vestor may, depending on the circumstances, understand an opinion\n statement to convey facts about the speaker’s basis for holding that\n view. Specifically, an issuer’s statement of opinion may fairly imply\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  facts about the inquiry the issuer conducted or the knowledge it had.\n  And if the real facts are otherwise, but not provided, the opinion\n  statement will mislead by omission.\n     An opinion statement, however, is not misleading simply because\n  the issuer knows, but fails to disclose, some fact cutting the other\n  way. A reasonable investor does not expect that every fact known to\n  an issuer supports its opinion statement. Moreover, whether an\n  omission makes an expression of opinion misleading always depends\n  on context. Reasonable investors understand opinion statements in\n  light of the surrounding text, and §11 creates liability only for the\n  omission of material facts that cannot be squared with a fair reading\n  of the registration statement as a whole. Omnicare’s arguments to\n  the contrary are unavailing. Pp. 10–19.\n       (b) Because neither court below considered the Funds’ omissions\n  theory under the right standard, this case is remanded for a determi-\n  nation of whether the Funds have stated a viable omissions claim.\n  On remand, the court must review the Funds’ complaint to determine\n  whether it adequately alleges that Omnicare omitted from the regis-\n  tration statement some specific fact that would have been material to\n  a reasonable investor. If so, the court must decide whether the al-\n  leged omission rendered Omnicare’s opinion statements misleading\n  in context.

If that document\neither “contain[s] an untrue statement of a material fact”\nor “omit[s] to state a material fact . . . necessary to make\nthe statements therein not misleading,” a purchaser of the\nstock may sue for damages. 15 U. S. C. §77k(a). This case\nrequires us to decide how each of those phrases applies to\nstatements of opinion.\n                                I\n   The Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, 15 U. S. C. §77a\net seq., protects investors by ensuring that companies\nissuing securities (known as “issuers”) make a “full and\nfair disclosure of information” relevant to a public offering.\nPinter v. Dahl, 486 U. S. 622, 646 (1988). The linchpin of\nthe Act is its registration requirement. With limited\nexceptions not relevant here, an issuer may offer securi-\nties to the public only after filing a registration statement.\nSee §§77d, 77e. That statement must contain specified\n2       OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ninformation about both the company itself and the security\nfor sale. See §§77g, 77aa. Beyond those required disclo-\nsures, the issuer may include additional representations of\neither fact or opinion.\n  Section 11 of the Act promotes compliance with these\ndisclosure provisions by giving purchasers a right of action\nagainst an issuer or designated individuals (directors,\npartners, underwriters, and so forth) for material mis-\nstatements or omissions in registration statements. As\nrelevant here, that section provides:\n    “In case any part of the registration statement, when\n    such part became effective, contained an untrue\n    statement of a material fact or omitted to state a ma-\n    terial fact required to be stated therein or necessary to\n    make the statements therein not misleading, any per-\n    son acquiring such security . . . [may] sue.” §77k(a).\nSection 11 thus creates two ways to hold issuers liable for\nthe contents of a registration statement—one focusing on\nwhat the statement says and the other on what it leaves\nout. Either way, the buyer need not prove (as he must to\nestablish certain other securities offenses) that the de-\nfendant acted with any intent to deceive or defraud.\nHerman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 381–\n382 (1983).\n  This case arises out of a registration statement that\npetitioner Omnicare filed in connection with a public\noffering of common stock. Omnicare is the nation’s largest\nprovider of pharmacy services for residents of nursing\nhomes. Its registration statement contained (along with\nall mandated disclosures) analysis of the effects of various\nfederal and state laws on its business model, including its\nacceptance of rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers.\nSee, e.g., App. 88–107, 132–140, 154–166. Of significance\nhere, two sentences in the registration statement ex-\npressed Omnicare’s view of its compliance with legal\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirements:\n     “We believe our contract arrangements with other\n       healthcare providers, our pharmaceutical suppli-\n       ers and our pharmacy practices are in compliance\n       with applicable federal and state laws.” Id., at 95.\n     “We believe that our contracts with pharmaceutical\n       manufacturers are legally and economically valid\n       arrangements that bring value to the healthcare\n       system and the patients that we serve.” Id., at 137.\nAccompanying those legal opinions were some caveats. On\nthe same page as the first statement above, Omnicare\nmentioned several state-initiated “enforcement actions\nagainst pharmaceutical manufacturers” for offering pay-\nments to pharmacies that dispensed their products; it then\ncautioned that the laws relating to that practice might “be\ninterpreted in the future in a manner inconsistent with\nour interpretation and application.” Id., at 96. And adja-\ncent to the second statement, Omnicare noted that the\nFederal Government had expressed “significant concerns”\nabout some manufacturers’ rebates to pharmacies and\nwarned that business might suffer “if these price conces-\nsions were no longer provided.” Id., at 136–137.\n  Respondents here, pension funds that purchased Om-\nnicare stock in the public offering (hereinafter Funds),\nbrought suit alleging that the company’s two opinion\nstatements about legal compliance give rise to liability\nunder §11. Citing lawsuits that the Federal Government\nlater pressed against Omnicare, the Funds’ complaint\nmaintained that the company’s receipt of payments from\ndrug manufacturers violated anti-kickback laws. See id.,\nat 181–186, 203–226. Accordingly, the complaint asserted,\nOmnicare made “materially false” representations about\nlegal compliance. Id., at 274. And so too, the complaint\ncontinued, the company “omitted to state [material] facts\nnecessary” to make its representations not misleading.\n4       OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nId., at 273. The Funds claimed that none of Omnicare’s\nofficers and directors “possessed reasonable grounds” for\nthinking that the opinions offered were truthful and com-\nplete. Id., at 274. Indeed, the complaint noted that one of\nOmnicare’s attorneys had warned that a particular con-\ntract “carrie[d] a heightened risk” of liability under anti-\nkickback laws. Id., at 225 (emphasis deleted). At the\nsame time, the Funds made clear that in light of §11’s\nstrict liability standard, they chose to “exclude and dis-\nclaim any allegation that could be construed as alleging\nfraud or intentional or reckless misconduct.” Id., at 273.\n  The District Court granted Omnicare’s motion to dis-\nmiss. See Civ. No. 2006–26 (ED Ky., Feb. 13, 2012), App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 28a, 38a–40a, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">462551</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *4–*5. In\nthe court’s view, “statements regarding a company’s belief\nas to its legal compliance are considered ‘soft’ information”\nand are actionable only if those who made them “knew\n[they] were untrue at the time.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a.\nThe court concluded that the Funds’ complaint failed to\nmeet that standard because it nowhere claimed that “the\ncompany’s officers knew they were violating the law.” Id.,\nat 39a. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit re-\nversed. See 719 F. 3d 498 (2013). It acknowledged that\nthe two statements highlighted in the Funds’ complaint\nexpressed Omnicare’s “opinion” of legal compliance, rather\nthan “hard facts.” Id., at 504 (quoting In re Sofamor\nDanek Group Inc., 123 F. 3d 394, 401–402 (CA6 1997)).\nBut even so, the court held, the Funds had to allege only\nthat the stated belief was “objectively false”; they did not\nneed to contend that anyone at Omnicare “disbelieved [the\nopinion] at the time it was expressed.” 719 F. 3d, at 506\n(quoting Fait v. Regions Financial Corp., 655 F. 3d 105,\n110 (CA2 2011)).\n  We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014), to consider\nhow §11 pertains to statements of opinion. We do so in\ntwo steps, corresponding to the two parts of §11 and the\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntwo theories in the Funds’ complaint. We initially address\nthe Funds’ claim that Omnicare made “untrue state-\nment[s] of . . . material fact” in offering its views on legal\ncompliance. §77k(a); see App. 273–274. We then take up\nthe Funds’ argument that Omnicare “omitted to state a\nmaterial fact . . . necessary to make the statements [in its\nregistration filing] not misleading.” §77k(a); see App.\n273–274. Unlike both courts below, we see those allega-\ntions as presenting different issues.1 In resolving the first,\nwe discuss when an opinion itself constitutes a factual\nmisstatement. In analyzing the second, we address when\nan opinion may be rendered misleading by the omission of\ndiscrete factual representations. Because we find that the\nCourt of Appeals applied the wrong standard, we vacate\nits decision.\n——————\n   1 In his concurrence, JUSTICE THOMAS contends that the lower courts’\n\nerroneous conflation of these two questions should limit the scope of our\nreview: We should say nothing about omissions, he maintains, because\nthat issue was not pressed or passed on below. We disagree. Although\nthe Funds could have written a clearer complaint, they raised a discrete\nomissions claim. See, e.g., App. 191 (“[T]he Company’s 2005 Registra-\ntion Statement . . . omitted material information that was . . . necessary\nto make the Registration Statement not misleading”); id., at 273 (“The\nRegistration Statement . . . omitted to state facts necessary to make the\nstatements made not misleading, and failed to adequately disclose\nmaterial facts as described above”). The lower courts chose not to\naddress that claim separately, but understood that the complaint\nalleged not only misstatements but also omissions. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 38a (describing the Funds’ claims as relating to “misstate-\nments/omissions” and dismissing the lot as “not actionable”); 719 F. 3d,\nat 501 (giving a single rationale for reversing the District Court’s\ndismissal of the Funds’ claims “for material misstatements and omis-\nsions”). And the omissions issue was the crux of the parties’ dispute\nbefore this Court. The question was fully briefed by both parties (plus\nthe Solicitor General), and omissions played a starring role at oral\nargument. Neither in its briefs nor at argument did Omnicare ever\nobject that the Funds’ omissions theory had been forfeited or was not\nproperly before this Court. We therefore see no reason to ignore the\nissue.\n6       OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                                II\n    The Sixth Circuit held, and the Funds now urge, that a\nstatement of opinion that is ultimately found incorrect—\neven if believed at the time made—may count as an “un-\ntrue statement of a material fact.” 15 U. S. C §77k(a); see\n719 F. 3d, at 505; Brief for Respondents 20–26. As the\nFunds put the point, a statement of belief may make an\nimplicit assertion about the belief ’s “subject matter”: To\nsay “we believe X is true” is often to indicate that “X is in\nfact true.” Id., at 23; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 36. In just that\nway, the Funds conclude, an issuer’s statement that “we\nbelieve we are following the law” conveys that “we in fact\nare following the law”—which is “materially false,” no\nmatter what the issuer thinks, if instead it is violating an\nanti-kickback statute. Brief for Respondents 1.\n    But that argument wrongly conflates facts and opinions.\nA fact is “a thing done or existing” or “[a]n actual happen-\ning.” Webster’s New International Dictionary 782 (1927).\nAn opinion is “a belief[,] a view,” or a “sentiment which the\nmind forms of persons or things.” Id., at 1509. Most\nimportant, a statement of fact (“the coffee is hot”) expresses\ncertainty about a thing, whereas a statement of opinion\n(“I think the coffee is hot”) does not. See ibid. (“An opin-\nion, in ordinary usage . . . does not imply . . . definiteness\n. . . or certainty”); 7 Oxford English Dictionary 151 (1933)\n(an opinion “rests[s] on grounds insufficient for complete\ndemonstration”). Indeed, that difference between the two\nis so ingrained in our everyday ways of speaking and\nthinking as to make resort to old dictionaries seem a mite\nsilly. And Congress effectively incorporated just that\ndistinction in §11’s first part by exposing issuers to liabil-\nity not for “untrue statement[s]” full stop (which would\nhave included ones of opinion), but only for “untrue state-\nment[s] of . . . fact.” §77k(a) (emphasis added).\n    Consider that statutory phrase’s application to two\nhypothetical statements, couched in ways the Funds claim\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nare equivalent. A company’s CEO states: “The TVs we\nmanufacture have the highest resolution available on the\nmarket.” Or, alternatively, the CEO transforms that\nfactual statement into one of opinion: “I believe” (or “I\nthink”) “the TVs we manufacture have the highest resolu-\ntion available on the market.” The first version would be\nan untrue statement of fact if a competitor had introduced\na higher resolution TV a month before—even assuming\nthe CEO had not yet learned of the new product. The\nCEO’s assertion, after all, is not mere puffery, but a de-\nterminate, verifiable statement about her company’s TVs;\nand the CEO, however innocently, got the facts wrong.\nBut in the same set of circumstances, the second version\nwould remain true. Just as she said, the CEO really did\nbelieve, when she made the statement, that her company’s\nTVs had the sharpest picture around. And although a\nplaintiff could later prove that opinion erroneous, the\nwords “I believe” themselves admitted that possibility,\nthus precluding liability for an untrue statement of fact.\nThat remains the case if the CEO’s opinion, as here, con-\ncerned legal compliance. If, for example, she said, “I\nbelieve our marketing practices are lawful,” and actually\ndid think that, she could not be liable for a false statement\nof fact—even if she afterward discovered a longtime viola-\ntion of law. Once again, the statement would have been\ntrue, because all she expressed was a view, not a certainty,\nabout legal compliance.\n   That still leaves some room for §11’s false-statement\nprovision to apply to expressions of opinion. As even\nOmnicare acknowledges, every such statement explicitly\naffirms one fact: that the speaker actually holds the stated\nbelief. See Brief for Petitioners 15–16; W. Keeton, D.\nDobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on the\nLaw of Torts §109, p. 755 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser and\nKeeton) (“[A]n expression of opinion is itself always a\nstatement of . . . the fact of the belief, the existing state of\n8         OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n             CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nmind, of the one who asserts it”). For that reason, the\nCEO’s statement about product quality (“I believe our TVs\nhave the highest resolution available on the market”)\nwould be an untrue statement of fact—namely, the fact of\nher own belief—if she knew that her company’s TVs only\nplaced second. And so too the statement about legal com-\npliance (“I believe our marketing practices are lawful”)\nwould falsely describe her own state of mind if she thought\nher company was breaking the law. In such cases, §11’s\nfirst part would subject the issuer to liability (assuming\nthe misrepresentation were material).2\n   In addition, some sentences that begin with opinion\nwords like “I believe” contain embedded statements of\nfact—as, once again, Omnicare recognizes. See Reply\nBrief 6. Suppose the CEO in our running hypothetical\nsaid: “I believe our TVs have the highest resolution avail-\nable because we use a patented technology to which our\ncompetitors do not have access.” That statement may be\nread to affirm not only the speaker’s state of mind, as\n——————\n   2 Our decision in Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S.\n\n1083 (1991), qualifies this statement in one respect. There, the Court\nconsidered when corporate directors’ statements of opinion in a proxy\nsolicitation give rise to liability under §14(a) of the Securities Exchange\nAct, 15 U. S. C. §78n(a), which bars conduct similar to that described in\n§11. In discussing that issue, the Court raised the hypothetical possi-\nbility that a director could think he was lying while actually (i.e.,\naccidentally) telling the truth about the matter addressed in his opin-\nion. See Virginia Bankshares, 501 U. S., at 1095–1096. That rare set\nof facts, the Court decided, would not lead to liability under §14(a). See\nibid. The Court reasoned that such an inadvertently correct assess-\nment is unlikely to cause anyone harm and that imposing liability\nmerely for the “impurities” of a director’s “unclean heart” might pro-\nvoke vexatious litigation. Id., at 1096 (quoting Stedman v.

So if our CEO\ndid not believe that her company’s TVs had the highest resolution on\nthe market, but (surprise!) they really did, §11 would not impose\nliability for her statement.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndescribed above, but also an underlying fact: that the\ncompany uses a patented technology. See Virginia Bank-\nshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083, 1109 (1991)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-\nment) (showing that a statement can sometimes be “most\nfairly read as affirming separately both the fact of the\n[speaker’s] opinion and the accuracy of the facts” given to\nsupport or explain it (emphasis deleted)). Accordingly,\nliability under §11’s false-statement provision would\nfollow (once again, assuming materiality) not only if the\nspeaker did not hold the belief she professed but also if the\nsupporting fact she supplied were untrue.\n   But the Funds cannot avail themselves of either of those\nways of demonstrating liability. The two sentences to\nwhich the Funds object are pure statements of opinion: To\nsimplify their content only a bit, Omnicare said in each\nthat “we believe we are obeying the law.” And the Funds\ndo not contest that Omnicare’s opinion was honestly held.\nRecall that their complaint explicitly “exclude[s] and\ndisclaim[s]” any allegation sounding in fraud or deception.\nApp. 273. What the Funds instead claim is that Omni-\ncare’s belief turned out to be wrong—that whatever the\ncompany thought, it was in fact violating anti-kickback\nlaws. But that allegation alone will not give rise to liabil-\nity under §11’s first clause because, as we have shown, a\nsincere statement of pure opinion is not an “untrue state-\nment of material fact,” regardless whether an investor can\nultimately prove the belief wrong. That clause, limited as\nit is to factual statements, does not allow investors to\nsecond-guess inherently subjective and uncertain assess-\nments. In other words, the provision is not, as the Court\nof Appeals and the Funds would have it, an invitation to\nMonday morning quarterback an issuer’s opinions.\n10        OMNICARE, INC. v.

Cf. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway,\nInc., 426 U. S. 438, 445 (1976) (noting that the securities\nlaws care only about the “significance of an omitted or\nmisrepresented fact to a reasonable investor”). We there-\nfore must consider when, if ever, the omission of a fact can\nmake a statement of opinion like Omnicare’s, even if\nliterally accurate, misleading to an ordinary investor.\n   Omnicare claims that is just not possible. On its view,\nno reasonable person, in any context, can understand a\npure statement of opinion to convey anything more than\nthe speaker’s own mindset. See Reply Brief 5–6. As long\nas an opinion is sincerely held, Omnicare argues, it cannot\nmislead as to any matter, regardless what related facts\nthe speaker has omitted. Such statements of belief (con-\ncludes Omnicare) are thus immune from liability under\n§11’s second part, just as they are under its first.4\n——————\n  3 Section 11’s omissions clause also applies when an issuer fails to\n\nmake mandated disclosures—those “required to be stated”—in a\nregistration statement. §77k(a). But the Funds do not object to Om-\nnicare’s filing on that score.\n  4 In a different argument that arrives at the same conclusion, Om-\n\nnicare maintains that §11, by its terms, bars only those omissions that\nmake statements of fact—not opinion—misleading. See Reply Brief 3–\n5. The language of the omissions clause, however, is not so limited. It\nasks whether an omitted fact is necessary to make “statements” in “any\npart of the registration statement” not misleading; unlike in §11’s first\nclause, here the word “statements” is unmodified, thus including both\nfact and opinion. In any event, Omnicare’s alternative interpretation\n                    Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  That claim has more than a kernel of truth. A reason-\nable person understands, and takes into account, the differ-\nence we have discussed above between a statement of fact\nand one of opinion. See supra, at 6–7. She recognizes the\nimport of words like “I think” or “I believe,” and grasps\nthat they convey some lack of certainty as to the state-\nment’s content. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Con-\ntracts §168, Comment a, p. 456 (1979) (noting that a\nstatement of opinion “implies that [the speaker] . . . is not\ncertain enough of what he says” to do without the qualify-\ning language). And that may be especially so when the\nphrases appear in a registration statement, which the\nreasonable investor expects has been carefully word-\nsmithed to comply with the law. When reading such a\ndocument, the investor thus distinguishes between the\nsentences “we believe X is true” and “X is true.” And\nbecause she does so, the omission of a fact that merely\nrebuts the latter statement fails to render the former\nmisleading. In other words, a statement of opinion is not\nmisleading just because external facts show the opinion to\nbe incorrect. Reasonable investors do not understand such\nstatements as guarantees, and §11’s omissions clause\ntherefore does not treat them that way.\n  But Omnicare takes its point too far, because a reason-\nable investor may, depending on the circumstances, under-\nstand an opinion statement to convey facts about how the\nspeaker has formed the opinion—or, otherwise put, about\nthe speaker’s basis for holding that view. And if the real\nfacts are otherwise, but not provided, the opinion state-\nment will mislead its audience. Consider an unadorned\n——————\nsucceeds merely in rephrasing the critical issue. Omnicare recognizes\nthat every opinion statement is also a factual statement about the\nspeaker’s own belief. See supra, at 7–8. On Omnicare’s view, the\nquestion thus becomes when, if ever, an omission can make a statement\nof that fact misleading to an ordinary investor. The following analysis\napplies just as well to that reformulation.\n12        OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n             CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nstatement of opinion about legal compliance: “We believe\nour conduct is lawful.” If the issuer makes that statement\nwithout having consulted a lawyer, it could be misleadingly\nincomplete. In the context of the securities market, an\ninvestor, though recognizing that legal opinions can prove\nwrong in the end, still likely expects such an assertion to\nrest on some meaningful legal inquiry—rather than, say,\non mere intuition, however sincere.5 Similarly, if the\nissuer made the statement in the face of its lawyers’ con-\ntrary advice, or with knowledge that the Federal Govern-\nment was taking the opposite view, the investor again has\ncause to complain: He expects not just that the issuer\nbelieves the opinion (however irrationally), but that it\nfairly aligns with the information in the issuer’s posses-\nsion at the time.6 Thus, if a registration statement omits\nmaterial facts about the issuer’s inquiry into or knowledge\nconcerning a statement of opinion, and if those facts\nconflict with what a reasonable investor would take from\nthe statement itself, then §11’s omissions clause creates\nliability.7\n——————\n  5  In some circumstances, however, reliance on advice from regulators\nor consistent industry practice might accord with a reasonable inves-\ntor’s expectations.\n  6 The hypothetical used earlier could demonstrate the same points.\n\nSuppose the CEO, in claiming that her company’s TV had the highest\nresolution available on the market, had failed to review any of her\ncompetitors’ product specifications. Or suppose she had recently\nreceived information from industry analysts indicating that a new\nproduct had surpassed her company’s on this metric. The CEO may\nstill honestly believe in her TV’s superiority. But under §11’s omissions\nprovision, that subjective belief, in the absence of the expected inquiry\nor in the face of known contradictory evidence, would not insulate her\nfrom liability.\n  7 Omnicare contends at length that Virginia Bankshares forecloses\n\nthis result, see Brief for Petitioners 16–21, relying on the following\nsentence: “A statement of belief may be open to objection . . . solely as a\nmisstatement of the psychological fact of the speaker’s belief in what he\nsays,” 501 U. S., at 1095. But Omnicare’s argument plucks that state-\n                      Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                      13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   An opinion statement, however, is not necessarily mis-\nleading when an issuer knows, but fails to disclose, some\nfact cutting the other way. Reasonable investors under-\nstand that opinions sometimes rest on a weighing of com-\npeting facts; indeed, the presence of such facts is one\nreason why an issuer may frame a statement as an opin-\nion, thus conveying uncertainty. See supra, at 6–7, 11.\nSuppose, for example, that in stating an opinion about\nlegal compliance, the issuer did not disclose that a single\njunior attorney expressed doubts about a practice’s legal-\nity, when six of his more senior colleagues gave a stamp of\napproval. That omission would not make the statement of\nopinion misleading, even if the minority position ulti-\nmately proved correct: A reasonable investor does not\nexpect that every fact known to an issuer supports its\nopinion statement.8\n——————\nment from its context and thereby transforms its meaning. Virginia\nBankshares concerned an expression of opinion that the speaker did not\nhonestly hold—i.e., one making an “untrue statement of fact” about the\nspeaker’s own state of mind, §77k(a). See id., at 1090 (“[W]e interpret\nthe jury verdict as finding that the . . . directors did not hold the beliefs\nor opinions expressed, and we confine our discussion to statements so\nmade”). The Court held that such a statement gives rise to liability\nunder §14(a) when it is also “false or misleading about its subject\nmatter.” Id., at 1096. Having done so, the Court went on to consider\nthe rare hypothetical case, described in this opinion’s second footnote,\nin which a speaker expresses an opinion that she does not actually\nhold, but that turns out to be right. See supra, at 8, n. 2. The sentence\nOmnicare cites did no more than introduce that hypothetical; it was a\nway of saying “someone might object to a statement—even when the\nopinion it expressed proved correct—solely on the ground that it was\ndisbelieved.” And the Court then held, as noted above, that such an\nobjection would fail. See ibid. The language thus provides no support\nfor Omnicare’s argument here.\n  8 We note, too, that a reasonable investor generally considers the\n\nspecificity of an opinion statement in making inferences about its basis.\nCompare two new statements from our ever-voluble CEO. In the first,\nshe says: “I believe we have 1.3 million TVs in our warehouse.” In the\nsecond, she says: “I believe we have enough supply on hand to meet\n14        OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n             CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   Moreover, whether an omission makes an expression of\nopinion misleading always depends on context. Registra-\ntion statements as a class are formal documents, filed with\nthe SEC as a legal prerequisite for selling securities to the\npublic. Investors do not, and are right not to, expect opin-\nions contained in those statements to reflect baseless, off-\nthe-cuff judgments, of the kind that an individual might\ncommunicate in daily life. At the same time, an investor\nreads each statement within such a document, whether of\nfact or of opinion, in light of all its surrounding text, in-\ncluding hedges, disclaimers, and apparently conflicting\ninformation. And the investor takes into account the\ncustoms and practices of the relevant industry. So an\nomission that renders misleading a statement of opinion\nwhen viewed in a vacuum may not do so once that state-\nment is considered, as is appropriate, in a broader frame.\nThe reasonable investor understands a statement of opin-\nion in its full context, and §11 creates liability only for the\nomission of material facts that cannot be squared with\nsuch a fair reading.\n   These principles are not unique to §11: They inhere, too,\nin much common law respecting the tort of misrepresenta-\ntion.9 The Restatement of Torts, for example, recognizes\nthat “[a] statement of opinion as to facts not disclosed and\nnot otherwise known to the recipient may” in some cir-\ncumstances reasonably “be interpreted by him as an im-\nplied statement” that the speaker “knows facts sufficient\nto justify him in forming” the opinion, or that he at least\n——————\ndemand.” All else equal, a reasonable person would think that a more\ndetailed investigation lay behind the former statement.\n   9 Section 11 is, of course, “not coextensive with common-law doctrines\n\nof fraud”; in particular, it establishes “a stringent standard of liability,”\nnot dependent on proof of intent to defraud. Herman & MacLean v.\nHuddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 381, 388–389 (1983); see supra, at 2; infra,\nat 15, n. 11. But we may still look to the common law for its insights\ninto how a reasonable person understands statements of opinion.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nknows no facts “incompatible with [the] opinion.” Re-\nstatement (Second) of Torts §539, p. 85 (1976).10 When\nthat is so, the Restatement explains, liability may result\nfrom omission of facts—for example, the fact that the\nspeaker failed to conduct any investigation—that rebut\nthe recipient’s predictable inference. See id., Comment a,\nat 86; id., Comment b, at 87. Similarly, the leading trea-\ntise in the area explains that “it has been recognized very\noften that the expression of an opinion may carry with it\nan implied assertion, not only that the speaker knows no\nfacts which would preclude such an opinion, but that he\ndoes know facts which justify it.” Prosser and Keeton\n§109, at 760. That is especially (and traditionally) the\ncase, the treatise continues, where—as in a registration\nstatement—a speaker “holds himself out or is understood\nas having special knowledge of the matter which is not\navailable to the plaintiff.” Id., at 760–761 (footnote omit-\nted); see Restatement (Second) of Torts §539, Comment b,\nat 86 (noting that omissions relating to an opinion’s basis\nare “particularly” likely to give rise to liability when the\nspeaker has “special knowledge of facts unknown to the\nrecipient”); Smith v. Land and House Property Corp.,\n[1884] 28 Ch. D. 7, 15 (App. Cas.) (appeal taken from Eng.)\n(opinion of Bowen, L. J.) (When “the facts are not equally\nknown to both sides, then a statement of opinion by the\none who knows the facts best . . . impliedly states that [the\nspeaker] knows facts which justify his opinion”).11\n——————\n  10 The Restatement of Contracts, discussing misrepresentations that\n\ncan void an agreement, says much the same: “[T]he recipient of an\nassertion of a person’s opinion as to facts not disclosed” may sometimes\n“properly interpret it as an assertion (a) that the facts known to that\nperson are not incompatible with his opinion, or (b) that he knows facts\nsufficient to justify him in forming it.” Restatement (Second) of Con-\ntracts §168, p. 455 (1979).\n  11 In invoking these principles, we disagree with JUSTICE SCALIA’s\n\ncommon-law-based opinion in two crucial ways. First, we view the\ncommon law’s emphasis on special knowledge and expertise as support-\n16        OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n             CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  And the purpose of §11 supports this understanding of\nhow the omissions clause maps onto opinion statements.\nCongress adopted §11 to ensure that issuers “tell[ ] the\nwhole truth” to investors. H. R. Rep. No. 85, 73d Cong.,\n1st Sess., 2 (1933) (quoting President Roosevelt’s message\nto Congress). For that reason, literal accuracy is not\nenough: An issuer must as well desist from misleading\ninvestors by saying one thing and holding back another.\nOmnicare would nullify that statutory requirement for all\nsentences starting with the phrases “we believe” or “we\nthink.” But those magic words can preface nearly any\nconclusion, and the resulting statements, as we have\nshown, remain perfectly capable of misleading investors.\nSee supra, at 11–12. Thus, Omnicare’s view would punch\na hole in the statute for half-truths in the form of opinion\nstatements. And the difficulty of showing that such\nstatements are literally false—which requires proving an\nissuer did not believe them, see supra, at 7–8—would\nmake that opening yet more consequential: Were Omni-\ncare right, companies would have virtual carte blanche to\nassert opinions in registration statements free from worry\n——————\ning, rather than contradicting, our view of what issuers’ opinion state-\nments fairly imply. That is because an issuer has special knowledge of\nits business—including the legal issues the company faces—not avail-\nable to an ordinary investor. Second, we think JUSTICE SCALIA’s reliance\non the common law’s requirement of an intent to deceive is inconsistent\nwith §11’s standard of liability. As we understand him, JUSTICE SCALIA\nwould limit liability for omissions under §11 to cases in which a speaker\n“subjectively intend[s] the deception” arising from the omission, on\nthe ground that the common law did the same. Post, at 6 (opinion\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted).\nBut §11 discards the common law’s intent requirement, making omis-\nsions unlawful—regardless of the issuer’s state of mind—so long as\nthey render statements misleading. See Herman & MacLean, 459\nU. S., at 382 (emphasizing that §11 imposes liability “even for innocent”\nmisstatements or omissions). The common law can help illuminate\nwhen an omission has that effect, but cannot change §11’s insistence on\nstrict liability. See supra, at 14, n. 9.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nabout §11. That outcome would ill-fit Congress’s decision\nto establish a strict liability offense promoting “full and\nfair disclosure” of material information. Pinter, 486 U. S.,\nat 646; see supra, at 1–2.\n   Omnicare argues, in response, that applying §11’s omis-\nsions clause in the way we have described would have\n“adverse policy consequences.” Reply Brief 17 (capitaliza-\ntion omitted). According to Omnicare, any inquiry into the\nissuer’s basis for holding an opinion is “hopelessly amor-\nphous,” threatening “unpredictable” and possibly “mas-\nsive” liability. Id., at 2; Brief for Petitioners 34, 36. And\nbecause that is so, Omnicare claims, many issuers will\nchoose not to disclose opinions at all, thus “depriving\n[investors] of potentially helpful information.” Reply Brief\n19; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 59–61.\n   But first, that claim is, just as Omnicare labels it, one of\n“policy”; and Congress gets to make policy, not the courts.\nThe decision Congress made, for the reasons we have\nindicated, was to extend §11 liability to all statements\nrendered misleading by omission. In doing so, Congress\nno doubt made §11 less cut-and-dry than a law prohibiting\nonly false factual statements. Section 11’s omissions\nclause, as applied to statements of both opinion and fact,\nnecessarily brings the reasonable person into the analysis,\nand asks what she would naturally understand a state-\nment to convey beyond its literal meaning. And for ex-\npressions of opinion, that means considering the founda-\ntion she would expect an issuer to have before making the\nstatement. See supra, at 11–12. All that, however, is a\nfeature, not a bug, of the omissions provision.\n   Moreover, Omnicare way overstates both the looseness\nof the inquiry Congress has mandated and the breadth of\nliability that approach threatens. As we have explained,\nan investor cannot state a claim by alleging only that an\nopinion was wrong; the complaint must as well call into\nquestion the issuer’s basis for offering the opinion. See\n18      OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsupra, at 11–12. And to do so, the investor cannot just say\nthat the issuer failed to reveal its basis. Section 11’s\nomissions clause, after all, is not a general disclosure\nrequirement; it affords a cause of action only when an\nissuer’s failure to include a material fact has rendered a\npublished statement misleading. To press such a claim,\nan investor must allege that kind of omission—and not\nmerely by means of conclusory assertions. See Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 678 (2009) (“Threadbare recitals of\nthe elements of a cause of action, supported by mere con-\nclusory statements, do not suffice”). To be specific: The\ninvestor must identify particular (and material) facts\ngoing to the basis for the issuer’s opinion—facts about the\ninquiry the issuer did or did not conduct or the knowledge\nit did or did not have—whose omission makes the opinion\nstatement at issue misleading to a reasonable person\nreading the statement fairly and in context. See supra, at\n11–14. That is no small task for an investor.\n   Nor does the inquiry such a complaint triggers ask\nanything unusual of courts. Numerous legal rules hinge\non what a reasonable person would think or expect. In\nrequiring courts to view statements of opinion from an\nordinary investor’s perspective, §11’s omissions clause\ndemands nothing more complicated or unmanageable.\nIndeed, courts have for decades engaged in just that in-\nquiry, with no apparent trouble, in applying the common\nlaw of misrepresentation. See supra, at 14–15.\n   Finally, we see no reason to think that liability for\nmisleading opinions will chill disclosures useful to inves-\ntors. Nothing indicates that §11’s application to mislead-\ning factual assertions in registration statements has\ncaused such a problem. And likewise, common-law doc-\ntrines of opinion liability have not, so far as anyone knows,\ndeterred merchants in ordinary commercial transactions\nfrom asserting helpful opinions about their products. That\nabsence of fallout is unsurprising. Sellers (whether of\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstock or other items) have strong economic incentives to\n. . . well, sell (i.e., hawk or peddle). Those market-based\nforces push back against any inclination to underdisclose.\nAnd to avoid exposure for omissions under §11, an issuer\nneed only divulge an opinion’s basis, or else make clear the\nreal tentativeness of its belief. Such ways of conveying\nopinions so that they do not mislead will keep valuable\ninformation flowing. And that is the only kind of infor-\nmation investors need. To the extent our decision today\nchills misleading opinions, that is all to the good: In enact-\ning §11, Congress worked to ensure better, not just more,\ninformation.\n                             B\n   Our analysis on this score counsels in favor of sending\nthe case back to the lower courts for decision. Neither\ncourt below considered the Funds’ omissions theory with\nthe right standard in mind—or indeed, even recognized\nthe distinct statutory questions that theory raises. See\nsupra, at 4–5. We therefore follow our ordinary practice of\nremanding for a determination of whether the Funds have\nstated a viable omissions claim (or, if not, whether they\nshould have a chance to replead).\n   In doing so, however, we reemphasize a few crucial\npoints pertinent to the inquiry on remand. Initially, as we\nhave said, the Funds cannot proceed without identifying\none or more facts left out of Omnicare’s registration\nstatement. See supra, at 17–18. The Funds’ recitation of\nthe statutory language—that Omnicare “omitted to state\nfacts necessary to make the statements made not mislead-\ning”—is not sufficient; neither is the Funds’ conclusory\nallegation that Omnicare lacked “reasonable grounds for\nthe belief ” it stated respecting legal compliance. App.\n273–274. At oral argument, however, the Funds high-\nlighted another, more specific allegation in their com-\nplaint: that an attorney had warned Omnicare that a\n20      OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nparticular contract “carrie[d] a heightened risk” of legal\nexposure under anti-kickback laws. Id., at 225 (emphasis\nomitted); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 42, 49; supra, at 4. On re-\nmand, the court must review the Funds’ complaint to\ndetermine whether it adequately alleged that Omnicare\nhad omitted that (purported) fact, or any other like it,\nfrom the registration statement. And if so, the court must\ndetermine whether the omitted fact would have been\nmaterial to a reasonable investor—i.e., whether “there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that a reasonable [investor] would\nconsider it important.” TSC Industries, 426 U. S., at 449.\n  Assuming the Funds clear those hurdles, the court must\nask whether the alleged omission rendered Omnicare’s\nlegal compliance opinions misleading in the way described\nearlier—i.e., because the excluded fact shows that Om-\nnicare lacked the basis for making those statements that a\nreasonable investor would expect. See supra, at 11–12.\nInsofar as the omitted fact at issue is the attorney’s warn-\ning, that inquiry entails consideration of such matters as\nthe attorney’s status and expertise and other legal infor-\nmation available to Omnicare at the time. See supra, at\n13. Further, the analysis of whether Omnicare’s opinion is\nmisleading must address the statement’s context. See\nsupra, at 14. That means the court must take account of\nwhatever facts Omnicare did provide about legal compli-\nance, as well as any other hedges, disclaimers, or qualifi-\ncations it included in its registration statement.

S. C. §77k(a). I agree with the Court’s\ndiscussion of what it means for an expression of opinion to\nstate an untrue material fact. But an expression of opin-\nion implies facts (beyond the fact that the speaker believes\nhis opinion) only where a reasonable listener would un-\nderstand it to do so. And it is only when expressions of\nopinion do imply these other facts that they can be “mis-\nleading” without the addition of other “material facts.”\nThe Court’s view would count far more expressions of\nopinion to convey collateral facts than I—or the common\nlaw—would, and I therefore concur only in part.\n   The common law recognized that most listeners hear “I\nbelieve,” “in my estimation,” and other related phrases as\ndisclaiming the assertion of a fact. Hence the (somewhat\noverbroad) common-law rule that a plaintiff cannot estab-\nlish a misrepresentation claim “for misstatements of\nopinion, as distinguished from those of fact.” W. Keeton,\nD. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on\n2        OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n            CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                    Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\nTorts §109, p. 755 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser & Keeton). A\nfraudulent misrepresentation claim based on an expres-\nsion of opinion could lie for the one fact the opinion reli-\nably conveyed: that the speaker in fact held the stated\nopinion. Restatement of Torts §525, Comment c, p. 60\n(1938). And, in some circumstances, the common law\nacknowledged that an expression of opinion reasonably\nimplied “that the maker knows of no fact incompatible\nwith his opinion.” Id. §539(1), at 91. The no-facts-\nincompatible-with-the-opinion standard was a demanding\none; it meant that a speaker’s judgment had to “var[y] so\nfar from the truth that no reasonable man in his position\ncould have such an opinion.” Restatement of Contracts\n§474(b), p. 902, and Comment b (1932). But without more,\na listener could only reasonably interpret expressions of\nopinion as conveying this limited assurance of a speaker’s\nunderstanding of facts.\n   In a few areas, the common law recognized the possibil-\nity that a listener could reasonably infer from an expres-\nsion of opinion not only (1) that the speaker sincerely held\nit, and (2) that the speaker knew of no facts incompatible\nwith the opinion, but also (3) that the speaker had a rea-\nsonable basis for holding the opinion. This exceptional\nrecognition occurred only where it was “very reasonable or\nprobable” that a listener should place special confidence in\na speaker’s opinion. Prosser & Keeton §109, at 760–761.\nThis included two main categories, both of which were\ncarve-outs from the general rule that “the ordinary man\nhas a reasonable competence to form his own opinion,” and\n“is not justified in relying [on] the . . . opinion” of another.\nRestatement of Torts §542, Comment a, at 95. First,\nexpressions of opinion made in the context of a relation-\nship of trust, such as between doctors and patients. Sec-\nond, expressions of opinion made by an expert in his ca-\npacity as an expert (for example, a jeweler’s statement of\nopinion about the value of a diamond). These exceptions\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nallowed a listener to deal with those special expressions of\nopinion as though they were facts. As the leading treatise\nput it, “the ordinary man is free to deal in reliance upon\nthe opinion of an expert jeweler as to the value of a dia-\nmond [or] of an attorney upon a point of law.” Prosser &\nKeeton §109, at 761. But what reasonable person would\nassume that a lawyer’s assessment of a diamond or a\njeweler’s opinion on a point of law implied an educated\ninvestigation?\n   The Court’s expansive application of §11’s omissions\nclause to expressions of opinion produces a far broader\nfield of misrepresentation; in fact, it produces almost the\nopposite of the common-law rule. The Court holds that a\nreasonable investor is right to expect a reasonable basis\nfor all opinions in registration statements—for example,\nthe conduct of a “meaningful . . . inquiry,”—unless that is\nsufficiently disclaimed. Ante, at 12, 14–15, 18–20. Take\nthe Court’s hypothetical opinion regarding legal compli-\nance. When a disclosure statement says “we believe our\nconduct is lawful,” ante, at 12, the Court thinks this\nshould be understood to suggest that a lawyer was con-\nsulted, since a reasonable investigation on this point\nwould require consulting a lawyer. But this approach is\nincompatible with the common law, which had no “legal\nopinions are different” exception. See Restatement of\nTorts §545, at 102.\n   It is also incompatible with common sense. It seems to\nme strange to suggest that a statement of opinion as\ngeneric as “we believe our conduct is lawful” conveys the\nimplied assertion of fact “we have conducted a meaningful\nlegal investigation before espousing this opinion.” It is\nstrange to ignore the reality that a director might rely on\nindustry practice, prior experience, or advice from regula-\ntors—rather than a meaningful legal investigation—in\nconcluding the firm’s conduct is lawful. The effect of the\nCourt’s rule is to adopt a presumption of expertise on all\n4       OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\ntopics volunteered within a registration statement.\n   It is reasonable enough to adopt such a presumption for\nthose matters that are required to be set forth in a regis-\ntration statement. Those are matters on which the man-\nagement of a corporation are experts. If, for example, the\nregistration statement said “we believe that the corpora-\ntion has $5,000,000 cash on hand,” or “we believe the\ncorporation has 7,500 shares of common stock outstand-\ning,” the public is entitled to assume that the management\nhas done the necessary research, so that the asserted\n“belief ” is undoubtedly correct. But of course a registra-\ntion statement would never preface such items, within the\nexpertise of the management, with a “we believe that.”\nFull compliance with the law, however, is another matter.\nIt is not specifically required to be set forth in the state-\nment, and when management prefaces that volunteered\ninformation with a “we believe that,” it flags the fact that\nthis is not within our area of expertise, but we think we\nare in compliance.\n   Moreover, even if one assumes that a corporation issu-\ning a registration statement is (by operation of law) an\n“expert” with regard to all matters stated or opined about,\nI would still not agree with the Court’s disposition. The\nCourt says the following:\n   “Section 11’s omissions clause, as applied to statements\n   of both opinion and fact, necessarily brings the reason-\n   able person into the analysis, and asks what she would\n   naturally understand a statement to convey beyond its\n   literal meaning. And for expressions of opinion, that\n   means considering the foundation she would expect an\n   issuer to have before making the statement.” Ante, at 17\n   (emphasis added).\nThe first sentence is true enough—but “what she [the\nreasonable (female) person, and even he, the reasonable\n(male) person] would naturally understand a statement [of\nopinion] to convey” is not that the statement has the foun-\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    5\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ndation she (the reasonable female person) considers ade-\nquate. She is not an expert, and is relying on the advice of\nan expert—who ought to know how much “foundation” is\nneeded. She would naturally understand that the expert\nhas conducted an investigation that he (or she or it) con-\nsidered adequate. That is what relying upon the opinion\nof an expert means.\n   The common law understood this distinction. An action\nfor fraudulent misrepresentation based on an opinion of\nan expert* was only allowed when the expression of the\nopinion conveyed a fact—the “fact” that summarized the\nexpert’s knowledge. Prosser and Keeton §109, at 761.\nAnd a fact was actionable only if the speaker knew it was\nfalse, if he knew he did not know it, or if he knew the\nlistener would understand the statement to have a basis\nthat the speaker knew was not true. Restatement of Torts\n§526, at 63–64. Ah!, the majority might say, so a speaker\nis liable for knowing he lacks the listener’s reasonable\nbasis! If the speaker knows—is actually aware—that the\nlistener will understand an expression of opinion to have a\nspecific basis that it does not have, then of course he satis-\nfies this element of the tort.\n   But more often, when any basis is implied at all, both\nsides will understand that the speaker implied a “reason-\nable basis,” but honestly disagree on what that means. And\nthe common law supplied a solution for this: A speaker was\nliable for ambiguous statements—misunderstandings—as\n\n——————\n  * At the time of the Act’s passage, the common law did not permit suit\nfor negligent misrepresentation under the circumstances here. An\naction for negligent misrepresentation resting upon a statement of\nopinion would lie only if the opinion—a professional opinion—was\n“given upon facts equally well known to both the supplier and the\nrecipient.” Restatement of Torts §552, Comment b, at 123 (1938). That\nis of course not the situation here. The typical opinion “given upon\nfacts equally known to both the supplier and the recipient” is a lawyer’s\nlegal advice on facts described by his client.\n6       OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\nfraudulent misrepresentations only where he both knew of\nthe ambiguity and intended that the listener fall prey to it.\nId. §527, at 66. In other words, even assuming both parties\nknew (a prerequisite to liability) that the expression of\nopinion implied a “reasonable investigation,” if the speaker\nand listener honestly disagreed on the nature of that inves-\ntigation, the speaker was not liable for a fraudulent misrep-\nresentation unless he subjectively intended the deception.\nAnd so in no circumstance would the listener’s belief of a\n“reasonable basis” control: If the speaker subjectively be-\nlieves he lacks a reasonable basis, then his statement is\nsimply a knowing misrepresentation. Id. §526(a), at 63. If\nhe does not know of the ambiguity, or knows of it, but does\nnot intend to deceive, he is not liable. Id. §527, at 66. That\nhis basis for belief was “objectively unreasonable” does not\nimpart liability, so long as the belief was genuine.\n   This aligns with common sense. When a client receives\nadvice from his lawyer, it is surely implicit in that advice\nthat the lawyer has conducted a reasonable investiga-\ntion—reasonable, that is, in the lawyer’s estimation. The\nclient is relying on the expert lawyer’s judgment for the\namount of investigation necessary, no less than for the\nlegal conclusion. To be sure, if the lawyer conducts an\ninvestigation that he does not believe is adequate, he\nwould be liable for misrepresentation. And if he conducts\nan investigation that he believes is adequate but is objec-\ntively unreasonable (and reaches an incorrect result), he\nmay be liable for malpractice. But on the latter premise\nhe is not liable for misrepresentation; all that was implicit\nin his advice was that he had conducted an investigation\nhe deemed adequate. To rely on an expert’s opinion is to\nrely on the expert’s evaluation of how much time to spend\non the question at hand.\n   The objective test proposed by the Court—inconsistent\nwith the common law and common intuitions about state-\nments of opinion—invites roundabout attacks upon ex-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\npressions of opinion. Litigants seeking recompense for a\ncorporation’s expression of belief that turned out, after the\nfact, to be incorrect can always charge that even though\nthe belief rested upon an investigation the corporation\nthought to be adequate, the investigation was not “objec-\ntively adequate.”\n   Nor is this objective test justified by §11’s absence of a\nmens rea requirement, as the Court suggests. Ante, at 15\nn.10. Some of my citation of the common law is meant to\nillustrate when a statement of opinion contains an implied\nwarranty of reasonable basis. But when it does so, the\nquestion then becomes whose reasonable basis. My illus-\ntration of the common-law requirements for misrepresen-\ntation is meant to show that a typical listener assumes\nthat the speaker’s reasonable basis controls. That show-\ning is not contradicted by §11’s absence of a mens rea\nrequirement.\n   Not to worry, says the Court. Sellers of securities need\n“only divulge an opinion’s basis, or else make clear the\nreal tentativeness of [their] belief[s].” Ante, at 18. One\nwonders what the function of “in my estimation” is, then,\nexcept as divulging such hesitation. Or what would be\nsufficient for the Court. “In my highly tentative estima-\ntion?” “In my estimation that, consistent with Omnicare,\nshould be understood as an opinion only?” Reasonable\nspeakers do not speak this way, and reasonable listeners\ndo not receive opinions this way. When an expert expresses\nan opinion instead of stating a fact, it implies (1) that\nhe genuinely believes the opinion, (2) that he believes his\nbasis for the opinion is sufficient, and (most important) (3)\nthat he is not certain of his result. Nothing more. This\napproach would have given lower courts and investors far\nmore guidance and would largely have avoided the Funds’\nattack upon Omnicare’s opinions as though Omnicare held\nthose opinions out to be facts.\n   I therefore concur only in part and in the judgment.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

I write\nseparately because I do not think it advisable to opine, as\nthe majority does, on an additional theory of liability that\nis not properly before us.\n   The question whether and under what circumstances an\nomission may make a statement of opinion misleading is\none that we should have left to the lower courts to decide\non remand.

With good\nreason: Apart from a few conclusory allegations in their\ncomplaint and some pro forma references to “misleading\nstatements and omissions” in their briefs, respondents did\nnot elaborate on the omissions theory of liability before\neither the District Court or the Court of Appeals. They\ncertainly did not articulate the theory the majority now\nadopts until they filed their merits brief before this Court.\nAnd it was not until oral argument that they identified a\nfactual allegation in their complaint that might serve to\nstate a claim under that theory.

S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 12)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, as a general\nrule, “we do not decide in the first instance issues not\ndecided below.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThis includes fashioning innovative theories of liability as\nmuch as it includes applying those theories to the circum-\nstances of the case.\n   The Court has previously relied on a lower court’s fail-\nure to address an issue below as a reason for declining to\naddress it here, even when the question was fairly pre-\nsented in the petition and fully vetted by other lower\ncourts. See, e.g., CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of\nRevenue, 562 U. S. 277, 284, n. 5 (2011); see also id., at\n303, n. 3 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Surely the feature that\ndistinguishes this case—a novel legal theory that is not\nfairly included in the question presented—counsels more\nstrongly in favor of avoidance.\n   As JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence reveals, the scope of\nthis theory of liability is far from certain. And the highly\nfact-intensive nature of the omissions theory provides an\nadditional reason not to address it at this time. The ma-\njority acknowledges that the facts a reasonable investor\nmay infer from a statement of opinion depend on the\ncontext. And yet it opines about certain facts an investor\nmay infer from an issuer’s legal compliance opinion: that\nsuch an opinion is based on legal advice, for example, or\nthat it is not contradicted by the Federal Government.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Argued November 3, 2014—Decided March 24, 2015\nThe Securities Act of 1933 requires that a company wishing to issue\n  securities must first file a registration statement containing specified\n  information about the issuing company and the securities offered.\n  See 15 U. S. C. §§77g, 77aa. The registration statement may also in-\n  clude other representations of fact or opinion. To protect investors\n  and promote compliance with these disclosure requirements, §11 of\n  the Act creates two ways to hold issuers liable for a registration\n  statement’s contents: A purchaser of securities may sue an issuer if\n  the registration statement either “contain[s] an untrue statement of a\n  material fact” or “omit[s] to state a material fact . . . necessary to\n  make the statements therein not misleading.” §77k(a). In either\n  case, the buyer need not prove that the issuer acted with any intent\n  to deceive or defraud. Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S.\n  375, 381–382.\n    Petitioner Omnicare, a pharmacy services company, filed a regis-\n  tration statement in connection with a public offering of common\n  stock. In addition to the required disclosures, the registration state-\n  ment contained two statements expressing the company’s opinion\n  that it was in compliance with federal and state laws. After the Fed-\n  eral Government filed suit against Omnicare for allegedly receiving\n  kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers, respondents, pension\n  funds that purchased Omnicare stock (hereinafter Funds), sued Om-\n  nicare under §11. They claimed that Omnicare’s legal-compliance\n  statements constituted “untrue statement[s] of . . . material fact” and\n  that Omnicare “omitted to state [material] facts necessary” to make\n  those statements not misleading.\n2         OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n             CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                            Syllabus\n\n\n    The District Court granted Omnicare’s motion to dismiss. Because\n the Funds had not alleged that Omnicare’s officers knew they were\n violating the law, the court found that the Funds had failed to state a\n §11 claim. The Sixth Circuit reversed. Acknowledging that the\n statements at issue expressed opinions, the court held that no show-\n ing of subjective disbelief was required. In the court’s view, the\n Funds’ allegations that Omnicare’s legal-compliance opinions were\n objectively false sufficed to support their claim.\nHeld:\n    1. A statement of opinion does not constitute an “untrue statement\n of . . . fact” simply because the stated opinion ultimately proves incor-\n rect. The Sixth Circuit’s contrary holding wrongly conflates facts and\n opinions. A statement of fact expresses certainty about a thing,\n whereas a statement of opinion conveys only an uncertain view as to\n that thing. Section 11 incorporates that distinction in its first clause\n by exposing issuers to liability only for “untrue statement[s] of . . .\n fact.” §77k(a) (emphasis added). Because a statement of opinion ad-\n mits the possibility of error, such a statement remains true—and\n thus is not an “untrue statement of . . . fact”—even if the opinion\n turns out to have been wrong.\n    But opinion statements are not wholly immune from liability under\n §11’s first clause. Every such statement explicitly affirms one fact:\n that the speaker actually holds the stated belief. A statement of\n opinion thus qualifies as an “untrue statement of . . . fact” if that fact\n is untrue—i.e., if the opinion expressed was not sincerely held. In\n addition, opinion statements can give rise to false-statement liability\n under §11 if they contain embedded statements of untrue facts.\n Here, however, Omnicare’s sincerity is not contested and the state-\n ments at issue are pure opinion statements. The Funds thus cannot\n establish liability under §11’s first clause. Pp. 6–10.\n    2. If a registration statement omits material facts about the issu-\n er’s inquiry into, or knowledge concerning, a statement of opinion,\n and if those facts conflict with what a reasonable investor, reading\n the statement fairly and in context, would take from the statement\n itself, then §11’s omissions clause creates liability. Pp. 10–20.\n       (a) For purposes of §11’s omissions clause, whether a statement\n is “misleading” is an objective inquiry that depends on a reasonable\n investor’s perspective. Cf. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426\n U. S. 438, 445. Omnicare goes too far by claiming that no reasonable\n person, in any context, can understand a statement of opinion to con-\n vey anything more than the speaker’s own mindset. A reasonable in-\n vestor may, depending on the circumstances, understand an opinion\n statement to convey facts about the speaker’s basis for holding that\n view. Specifically, an issuer’s statement of opinion may fairly imply\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

If that document\neither “contain[s] an untrue statement of a material fact”\nor “omit[s] to state a material fact . . . necessary to make\nthe statements therein not misleading,” a purchaser of the\nstock may sue for damages. 15 U. S. C. §77k(a). This case\nrequires us to decide how each of those phrases applies to\nstatements of opinion.\n                                I\n   The Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, 15 U. S. C. §77a\net seq., protects investors by ensuring that companies\nissuing securities (known as “issuers”) make a “full and\nfair disclosure of information” relevant to a public offering.\nPinter v. Dahl, 486 U. S. 622, 646 (1988). The linchpin of\nthe Act is its registration requirement. With limited\nexceptions not relevant here, an issuer may offer securi-\nties to the public only after filing a registration statement.\nSee §§77d, 77e. That statement must contain specified\n2       OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ninformation about both the company itself and the security\nfor sale. See §§77g, 77aa. Beyond those required disclo-\nsures, the issuer may include additional representations of\neither fact or opinion.\n  Section 11 of the Act promotes compliance with these\ndisclosure provisions by giving purchasers a right of action\nagainst an issuer or designated individuals (directors,\npartners, underwriters, and so forth) for material mis-\nstatements or omissions in registration statements. As\nrelevant here, that section provides:\n    “In case any part of the registration statement, when\n    such part became effective, contained an untrue\n    statement of a material fact or omitted to state a ma-\n    terial fact required to be stated therein or necessary to\n    make the statements therein not misleading, any per-\n    son acquiring such security . . . [may] sue.” §77k(a).\nSection 11 thus creates two ways to hold issuers liable for\nthe contents of a registration statement—one focusing on\nwhat the statement says and the other on what it leaves\nout. Either way, the buyer need not prove (as he must to\nestablish certain other securities offenses) that the de-\nfendant acted with any intent to deceive or defraud.\nHerman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 381–\n382 (1983).\n  This case arises out of a registration statement that\npetitioner Omnicare filed in connection with a public\noffering of common stock. Omnicare is the nation’s largest\nprovider of pharmacy services for residents of nursing\nhomes. Its registration statement contained (along with\nall mandated disclosures) analysis of the effects of various\nfederal and state laws on its business model, including its\nacceptance of rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers.\nSee, e.g., App. 88–107, 132–140, 154–166. Of significance\nhere, two sentences in the registration statement ex-\npressed Omnicare’s view of its compliance with legal\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirements:\n     “We believe our contract arrangements with other\n       healthcare providers, our pharmaceutical suppli-\n       ers and our pharmacy practices are in compliance\n       with applicable federal and state laws.” Id., at 95.\n     “We believe that our contracts with pharmaceutical\n       manufacturers are legally and economically valid\n       arrangements that bring value to the healthcare\n       system and the patients that we serve.” Id., at 137.\nAccompanying those legal opinions were some caveats. On\nthe same page as the first statement above, Omnicare\nmentioned several state-initiated “enforcement actions\nagainst pharmaceutical manufacturers” for offering pay-\nments to pharmacies that dispensed their products; it then\ncautioned that the laws relating to that practice might “be\ninterpreted in the future in a manner inconsistent with\nour interpretation and application.” Id., at 96. And adja-\ncent to the second statement, Omnicare noted that the\nFederal Government had expressed “significant concerns”\nabout some manufacturers’ rebates to pharmacies and\nwarned that business might suffer “if these price conces-\nsions were no longer provided.” Id., at 136–137.\n  Respondents here, pension funds that purchased Om-\nnicare stock in the public offering (hereinafter Funds),\nbrought suit alleging that the company’s two opinion\nstatements about legal compliance give rise to liability\nunder §11. Citing lawsuits that the Federal Government\nlater pressed against Omnicare, the Funds’ complaint\nmaintained that the company’s receipt of payments from\ndrug manufacturers violated anti-kickback laws. See id.,\nat 181–186, 203–226. Accordingly, the complaint asserted,\nOmnicare made “materially false” representations about\nlegal compliance. Id., at 274. And so too, the complaint\ncontinued, the company “omitted to state [material] facts\nnecessary” to make its representations not misleading.\n4       OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nId., at 273. The Funds claimed that none of Omnicare’s\nofficers and directors “possessed reasonable grounds” for\nthinking that the opinions offered were truthful and com-\nplete. Id., at 274. Indeed, the complaint noted that one of\nOmnicare’s attorneys had warned that a particular con-\ntract “carrie[d] a heightened risk” of liability under anti-\nkickback laws. Id., at 225 (emphasis deleted). At the\nsame time, the Funds made clear that in light of §11’s\nstrict liability standard, they chose to “exclude and dis-\nclaim any allegation that could be construed as alleging\nfraud or intentional or reckless misconduct.” Id., at 273.\n  The District Court granted Omnicare’s motion to dis-\nmiss. See Civ. No. 2006–26 (ED Ky., Feb. 13, 2012), App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 28a, 38a–40a, 2012 WL 462551, *4–*5. In\nthe court’s view, “statements regarding a company’s belief\nas to its legal compliance are considered ‘soft’ information”\nand are actionable only if those who made them “knew\n[they] were untrue at the time.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a.\nThe court concluded that the Funds’ complaint failed to\nmeet that standard because it nowhere claimed that “the\ncompany’s officers knew they were violating the law.” Id.,\nat 39a. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit re-\nversed. See 719 F. 3d 498 (2013). It acknowledged that\nthe two statements highlighted in the Funds’ complaint\nexpressed Omnicare’s “opinion” of legal compliance, rather\nthan “hard facts.” Id., at 504 (quoting In re Sofamor\nDanek Group Inc., 123 F. 3d 394, 401–402 (CA6 1997)).\nBut even so, the court held, the Funds had to allege only\nthat the stated belief was “objectively false”; they did not\nneed to contend that anyone at Omnicare “disbelieved [the\nopinion] at the time it was expressed.” 719 F. 3d, at 506\n(quoting Fait v. Regions Financial Corp., 655 F. 3d 105,\n110 (CA2 2011)).\n  We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014), to consider\nhow §11 pertains to statements of opinion. We do so in\ntwo steps, corresponding to the two parts of §11 and the\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

We initially address\nthe Funds’ claim that Omnicare made “untrue state-\nment[s] of . . . material fact” in offering its views on legal\ncompliance. §77k(a); see App. 273–274. We then take up\nthe Funds’ argument that Omnicare “omitted to state a\nmaterial fact . . . necessary to make the statements [in its\nregistration filing] not misleading.” §77k(a); see App.\n273–274. Unlike both courts below, we see those allega-\ntions as presenting different issues.1 In resolving the first,\nwe discuss when an opinion itself constitutes a factual\nmisstatement. In analyzing the second, we address when\nan opinion may be rendered misleading by the omission of\ndiscrete factual representations. Because we find that the\nCourt of Appeals applied the wrong standard, we vacate\nits decision.\n——————\n   1 In his concurrence, JUSTICE THOMAS contends that the lower courts’\n\nerroneous conflation of these two questions should limit the scope of our\nreview: We should say nothing about omissions, he maintains, because\nthat issue was not pressed or passed on below. We disagree. Although\nthe Funds could have written a clearer complaint, they raised a discrete\nomissions claim. See, e.g., App. 191 (“[T]he Company’s 2005 Registra-\ntion Statement . . . omitted material information that was . . . necessary\nto make the Registration Statement not misleading”); id., at 273 (“The\nRegistration Statement . . . omitted to state facts necessary to make the\nstatements made not misleading, and failed to adequately disclose\nmaterial facts as described above”). The lower courts chose not to\naddress that claim separately, but understood that the complaint\nalleged not only misstatements but also omissions. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 38a (describing the Funds’ claims as relating to “misstate-\nments/omissions” and dismissing the lot as “not actionable”); 719 F. 3d,\nat 501 (giving a single rationale for reversing the District Court’s\ndismissal of the Funds’ claims “for material misstatements and omis-\nsions”). And the omissions issue was the crux of the parties’ dispute\nbefore this Court. The question was fully briefed by both parties (plus\nthe Solicitor General), and omissions played a starring role at oral\nargument. Neither in its briefs nor at argument did Omnicare ever\nobject that the Funds’ omissions theory had been forfeited or was not\nproperly before this Court. We therefore see no reason to ignore the\nissue.\n6       OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                                II\n    The Sixth Circuit held, and the Funds now urge, that a\nstatement of opinion that is ultimately found incorrect—\neven if believed at the time made—may count as an “un-\ntrue statement of a material fact.” 15 U. S. C §77k(a); see\n719 F. 3d, at 505; Brief for Respondents 20–26. As the\nFunds put the point, a statement of belief may make an\nimplicit assertion about the belief ’s “subject matter”: To\nsay “we believe X is true” is often to indicate that “X is in\nfact true.” Id., at 23; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 36. In just that\nway, the Funds conclude, an issuer’s statement that “we\nbelieve we are following the law” conveys that “we in fact\nare following the law”—which is “materially false,” no\nmatter what the issuer thinks, if instead it is violating an\nanti-kickback statute. Brief for Respondents 1.\n    But that argument wrongly conflates facts and opinions.\nA fact is “a thing done or existing” or “[a]n actual happen-\ning.” Webster’s New International Dictionary 782 (1927).\nAn opinion is “a belief[,] a view,” or a “sentiment which the\nmind forms of persons or things.” Id., at 1509. Most\nimportant, a statement of fact (“the coffee is hot”) expresses\ncertainty about a thing, whereas a statement of opinion\n(“I think the coffee is hot”) does not. See ibid. (“An opin-\nion, in ordinary usage . . . does not imply . . . definiteness\n. . . or certainty”); 7 Oxford English Dictionary 151 (1933)\n(an opinion “rests[s] on grounds insufficient for complete\ndemonstration”). Indeed, that difference between the two\nis so ingrained in our everyday ways of speaking and\nthinking as to make resort to old dictionaries seem a mite\nsilly. And Congress effectively incorporated just that\ndistinction in §11’s first part by exposing issuers to liabil-\nity not for “untrue statement[s]” full stop (which would\nhave included ones of opinion), but only for “untrue state-\nment[s] of . . . fact.” §77k(a) (emphasis added).\n    Consider that statutory phrase’s application to two\nhypothetical statements, couched in ways the Funds claim\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nare equivalent. A company’s CEO states: “The TVs we\nmanufacture have the highest resolution available on the\nmarket.” Or, alternatively, the CEO transforms that\nfactual statement into one of opinion: “I believe” (or “I\nthink”) “the TVs we manufacture have the highest resolu-\ntion available on the market.” The first version would be\nan untrue statement of fact if a competitor had introduced\na higher resolution TV a month before—even assuming\nthe CEO had not yet learned of the new product. The\nCEO’s assertion, after all, is not mere puffery, but a de-\nterminate, verifiable statement about her company’s TVs;\nand the CEO, however innocently, got the facts wrong.\nBut in the same set of circumstances, the second version\nwould remain true. Just as she said, the CEO really did\nbelieve, when she made the statement, that her company’s\nTVs had the sharpest picture around. And although a\nplaintiff could later prove that opinion erroneous, the\nwords “I believe” themselves admitted that possibility,\nthus precluding liability for an untrue statement of fact.\nThat remains the case if the CEO’s opinion, as here, con-\ncerned legal compliance. If, for example, she said, “I\nbelieve our marketing practices are lawful,” and actually\ndid think that, she could not be liable for a false statement\nof fact—even if she afterward discovered a longtime viola-\ntion of law. Once again, the statement would have been\ntrue, because all she expressed was a view, not a certainty,\nabout legal compliance.\n   That still leaves some room for §11’s false-statement\nprovision to apply to expressions of opinion. As even\nOmnicare acknowledges, every such statement explicitly\naffirms one fact: that the speaker actually holds the stated\nbelief. See Brief for Petitioners 15–16; W. Keeton, D.\nDobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on the\nLaw of Torts §109, p. 755 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser and\nKeeton) (“[A]n expression of opinion is itself always a\nstatement of . . . the fact of the belief, the existing state of\n8         OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n             CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nmind, of the one who asserts it”). For that reason, the\nCEO’s statement about product quality (“I believe our TVs\nhave the highest resolution available on the market”)\nwould be an untrue statement of fact—namely, the fact of\nher own belief—if she knew that her company’s TVs only\nplaced second. And so too the statement about legal com-\npliance (“I believe our marketing practices are lawful”)\nwould falsely describe her own state of mind if she thought\nher company was breaking the law. In such cases, §11’s\nfirst part would subject the issuer to liability (assuming\nthe misrepresentation were material).2\n   In addition, some sentences that begin with opinion\nwords like “I believe” contain embedded statements of\nfact—as, once again, Omnicare recognizes. See Reply\nBrief 6. Suppose the CEO in our running hypothetical\nsaid: “I believe our TVs have the highest resolution avail-\nable because we use a patented technology to which our\ncompetitors do not have access.” That statement may be\nread to affirm not only the speaker’s state of mind, as\n——————\n   2 Our decision in Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S.\n\n1083 (1991), qualifies this statement in one respect. There, the Court\nconsidered when corporate directors’ statements of opinion in a proxy\nsolicitation give rise to liability under §14(a) of the Securities Exchange\nAct, 15 U. S. C. §78n(a), which bars conduct similar to that described in\n§11. In discussing that issue, the Court raised the hypothetical possi-\nbility that a director could think he was lying while actually (i.e.,\naccidentally) telling the truth about the matter addressed in his opin-\nion. See Virginia Bankshares, 501 U. S., at 1095–1096. That rare set\nof facts, the Court decided, would not lead to liability under §14(a). See\nibid. The Court reasoned that such an inadvertently correct assess-\nment is unlikely to cause anyone harm and that imposing liability\nmerely for the “impurities” of a director’s “unclean heart” might pro-\nvoke vexatious litigation. Id., at 1096 (quoting Stedman v. Storer, 308\nF. Supp. 881, 887 (SDNY 1969)). We think the same is true (to the\nextent this scenario ever occurs in real life) under §11. So if our CEO\ndid not believe that her company’s TVs had the highest resolution on\nthe market, but (surprise!) they really did, §11 would not impose\nliability for her statement.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndescribed above, but also an underlying fact: that the\ncompany uses a patented technology. See Virginia Bank-\nshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083, 1109 (1991)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-\nment) (showing that a statement can sometimes be “most\nfairly read as affirming separately both the fact of the\n[speaker’s] opinion and the accuracy of the facts” given to\nsupport or explain it (emphasis deleted)). Accordingly,\nliability under §11’s false-statement provision would\nfollow (once again, assuming materiality) not only if the\nspeaker did not hold the belief she professed but also if the\nsupporting fact she supplied were untrue.\n   But the Funds cannot avail themselves of either of those\nways of demonstrating liability. The two sentences to\nwhich the Funds object are pure statements of opinion: To\nsimplify their content only a bit, Omnicare said in each\nthat “we believe we are obeying the law.” And the Funds\ndo not contest that Omnicare’s opinion was honestly held.\nRecall that their complaint explicitly “exclude[s] and\ndisclaim[s]” any allegation sounding in fraud or deception.\nApp. 273. What the Funds instead claim is that Omni-\ncare’s belief turned out to be wrong—that whatever the\ncompany thought, it was in fact violating anti-kickback\nlaws. But that allegation alone will not give rise to liabil-\nity under §11’s first clause because, as we have shown, a\nsincere statement of pure opinion is not an “untrue state-\nment of material fact,” regardless whether an investor can\nultimately prove the belief wrong. That clause, limited as\nit is to factual statements, does not allow investors to\nsecond-guess inherently subjective and uncertain assess-\nments. In other words, the provision is not, as the Court\nof Appeals and the Funds would have it, an invitation to\nMonday morning quarterback an issuer’s opinions.\n10        OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n             CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n   That conclusion, however, does not end this case be-\ncause the Funds also rely on §11’s omissions provision,\nalleging that Omnicare “omitted to state facts necessary”\nto make its opinion on legal compliance “not misleading.”\nApp. 273; see §77k(a).3 As all parties accept, whether a\nstatement is “misleading” depends on the perspective of a\nreasonable investor: The inquiry (like the one into materi-\nality) is objective. Cf. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway,\nInc., 426 U. S. 438, 445 (1976) (noting that the securities\nlaws care only about the “significance of an omitted or\nmisrepresented fact to a reasonable investor”). We there-\nfore must consider when, if ever, the omission of a fact can\nmake a statement of opinion like Omnicare’s, even if\nliterally accurate, misleading to an ordinary investor.\n   Omnicare claims that is just not possible. On its view,\nno reasonable person, in any context, can understand a\npure statement of opinion to convey anything more than\nthe speaker’s own mindset. See Reply Brief 5–6. As long\nas an opinion is sincerely held, Omnicare argues, it cannot\nmislead as to any matter, regardless what related facts\nthe speaker has omitted. Such statements of belief (con-\ncludes Omnicare) are thus immune from liability under\n§11’s second part, just as they are under its first.4\n——————\n  3 Section 11’s omissions clause also applies when an issuer fails to\n\nmake mandated disclosures—those “required to be stated”—in a\nregistration statement. §77k(a). But the Funds do not object to Om-\nnicare’s filing on that score.\n  4 In a different argument that arrives at the same conclusion, Om-\n\nnicare maintains that §11, by its terms, bars only those omissions that\nmake statements of fact—not opinion—misleading. See Reply Brief 3–\n5. The language of the omissions clause, however, is not so limited. It\nasks whether an omitted fact is necessary to make “statements” in “any\npart of the registration statement” not misleading; unlike in §11’s first\nclause, here the word “statements” is unmodified, thus including both\nfact and opinion. In any event, Omnicare’s alternative interpretation\n                    Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  That claim has more than a kernel of truth. A reason-\nable person understands, and takes into account, the differ-\nence we have discussed above between a statement of fact\nand one of opinion. See supra, at 6–7. She recognizes the\nimport of words like “I think” or “I believe,” and grasps\nthat they convey some lack of certainty as to the state-\nment’s content. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Con-\ntracts §168, Comment a, p. 456 (1979) (noting that a\nstatement of opinion “implies that [the speaker] . . . is not\ncertain enough of what he says” to do without the qualify-\ning language). And that may be especially so when the\nphrases appear in a registration statement, which the\nreasonable investor expects has been carefully word-\nsmithed to comply with the law. When reading such a\ndocument, the investor thus distinguishes between the\nsentences “we believe X is true” and “X is true.” And\nbecause she does so, the omission of a fact that merely\nrebuts the latter statement fails to render the former\nmisleading. In other words, a statement of opinion is not\nmisleading just because external facts show the opinion to\nbe incorrect. Reasonable investors do not understand such\nstatements as guarantees, and §11’s omissions clause\ntherefore does not treat them that way.\n  But Omnicare takes its point too far, because a reason-\nable investor may, depending on the circumstances, under-\nstand an opinion statement to convey facts about how the\nspeaker has formed the opinion—or, otherwise put, about\nthe speaker’s basis for holding that view. And if the real\nfacts are otherwise, but not provided, the opinion state-\nment will mislead its audience. Consider an unadorned\n——————\nsucceeds merely in rephrasing the critical issue. Omnicare recognizes\nthat every opinion statement is also a factual statement about the\nspeaker’s own belief. See supra, at 7–8. On Omnicare’s view, the\nquestion thus becomes when, if ever, an omission can make a statement\nof that fact misleading to an ordinary investor. The following analysis\napplies just as well to that reformulation.\n12        OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n             CONSTR.

In the context of the securities market, an\ninvestor, though recognizing that legal opinions can prove\nwrong in the end, still likely expects such an assertion to\nrest on some meaningful legal inquiry—rather than, say,\non mere intuition, however sincere.5 Similarly, if the\nissuer made the statement in the face of its lawyers’ con-\ntrary advice, or with knowledge that the Federal Govern-\nment was taking the opposite view, the investor again has\ncause to complain: He expects not just that the issuer\nbelieves the opinion (however irrationally), but that it\nfairly aligns with the information in the issuer’s posses-\nsion at the time.6 Thus, if a registration statement omits\nmaterial facts about the issuer’s inquiry into or knowledge\nconcerning a statement of opinion, and if those facts\nconflict with what a reasonable investor would take from\nthe statement itself, then §11’s omissions clause creates\nliability.7\n——————\n  5  In some circumstances, however, reliance on advice from regulators\nor consistent industry practice might accord with a reasonable inves-\ntor’s expectations.\n  6 The hypothetical used earlier could demonstrate the same points.\n\nSuppose the CEO, in claiming that her company’s TV had the highest\nresolution available on the market, had failed to review any of her\ncompetitors’ product specifications. Or suppose she had recently\nreceived information from industry analysts indicating that a new\nproduct had surpassed her company’s on this metric. The CEO may\nstill honestly believe in her TV’s superiority. But under §11’s omissions\nprovision, that subjective belief, in the absence of the expected inquiry\nor in the face of known contradictory evidence, would not insulate her\nfrom liability.\n  7 Omnicare contends at length that Virginia Bankshares forecloses\n\nthis result, see Brief for Petitioners 16–21, relying on the following\nsentence: “A statement of belief may be open to objection . . . solely as a\nmisstatement of the psychological fact of the speaker’s belief in what he\nsays,” 501 U. S., at 1095. But Omnicare’s argument plucks that state-\n                      Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                      13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   An opinion statement, however, is not necessarily mis-\nleading when an issuer knows, but fails to disclose, some\nfact cutting the other way. Reasonable investors under-\nstand that opinions sometimes rest on a weighing of com-\npeting facts; indeed, the presence of such facts is one\nreason why an issuer may frame a statement as an opin-\nion, thus conveying uncertainty. See supra, at 6–7, 11.\nSuppose, for example, that in stating an opinion about\nlegal compliance, the issuer did not disclose that a single\njunior attorney expressed doubts about a practice’s legal-\nity, when six of his more senior colleagues gave a stamp of\napproval. That omission would not make the statement of\nopinion misleading, even if the minority position ulti-\nmately proved correct: A reasonable investor does not\nexpect that every fact known to an issuer supports its\nopinion statement.8\n——————\nment from its context and thereby transforms its meaning. Virginia\nBankshares concerned an expression of opinion that the speaker did not\nhonestly hold—i.e., one making an “untrue statement of fact” about the\nspeaker’s own state of mind, §77k(a). See id., at 1090 (“[W]e interpret\nthe jury verdict as finding that the . . . directors did not hold the beliefs\nor opinions expressed, and we confine our discussion to statements so\nmade”). The Court held that such a statement gives rise to liability\nunder §14(a) when it is also “false or misleading about its subject\nmatter.” Id., at 1096. Having done so, the Court went on to consider\nthe rare hypothetical case, described in this opinion’s second footnote,\nin which a speaker expresses an opinion that she does not actually\nhold, but that turns out to be right. See supra, at 8, n. 2. The sentence\nOmnicare cites did no more than introduce that hypothetical; it was a\nway of saying “someone might object to a statement—even when the\nopinion it expressed proved correct—solely on the ground that it was\ndisbelieved.” And the Court then held, as noted above, that such an\nobjection would fail. See ibid. The language thus provides no support\nfor Omnicare’s argument here.\n  8 We note, too, that a reasonable investor generally considers the\n\nspecificity of an opinion statement in making inferences about its basis.\nCompare two new statements from our ever-voluble CEO. In the first,\nshe says: “I believe we have 1.3 million TVs in our warehouse.” In the\nsecond, she says: “I believe we have enough supply on hand to meet\n14        OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n             CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   Moreover, whether an omission makes an expression of\nopinion misleading always depends on context. Registra-\ntion statements as a class are formal documents, filed with\nthe SEC as a legal prerequisite for selling securities to the\npublic. Investors do not, and are right not to, expect opin-\nions contained in those statements to reflect baseless, off-\nthe-cuff judgments, of the kind that an individual might\ncommunicate in daily life. At the same time, an investor\nreads each statement within such a document, whether of\nfact or of opinion, in light of all its surrounding text, in-\ncluding hedges, disclaimers, and apparently conflicting\ninformation. And the investor takes into account the\ncustoms and practices of the relevant industry. So an\nomission that renders misleading a statement of opinion\nwhen viewed in a vacuum may not do so once that state-\nment is considered, as is appropriate, in a broader frame.\nThe reasonable investor understands a statement of opin-\nion in its full context, and §11 creates liability only for the\nomission of material facts that cannot be squared with\nsuch a fair reading.\n   These principles are not unique to §11: They inhere, too,\nin much common law respecting the tort of misrepresenta-\ntion.9 The Restatement of Torts, for example, recognizes\nthat “[a] statement of opinion as to facts not disclosed and\nnot otherwise known to the recipient may” in some cir-\ncumstances reasonably “be interpreted by him as an im-\nplied statement” that the speaker “knows facts sufficient\nto justify him in forming” the opinion, or that he at least\n——————\ndemand.” All else equal, a reasonable person would think that a more\ndetailed investigation lay behind the former statement.\n   9 Section 11 is, of course, “not coextensive with common-law doctrines\n\nof fraud”; in particular, it establishes “a stringent standard of liability,”\nnot dependent on proof of intent to defraud. Herman & MacLean v.\nHuddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 381, 388–389 (1983); see supra, at 2; infra,\nat 15, n. 11. But we may still look to the common law for its insights\ninto how a reasonable person understands statements of opinion.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nknows no facts “incompatible with [the] opinion.” Re-\nstatement (Second) of Torts §539, p. 85 (1976).10 When\nthat is so, the Restatement explains, liability may result\nfrom omission of facts—for example, the fact that the\nspeaker failed to conduct any investigation—that rebut\nthe recipient’s predictable inference. See id., Comment a,\nat 86; id., Comment b, at 87. Similarly, the leading trea-\ntise in the area explains that “it has been recognized very\noften that the expression of an opinion may carry with it\nan implied assertion, not only that the speaker knows no\nfacts which would preclude such an opinion, but that he\ndoes know facts which justify it.” Prosser and Keeton\n§109, at 760. That is especially (and traditionally) the\ncase, the treatise continues, where—as in a registration\nstatement—a speaker “holds himself out or is understood\nas having special knowledge of the matter which is not\navailable to the plaintiff.” Id., at 760–761 (footnote omit-\nted); see Restatement (Second) of Torts §539, Comment b,\nat 86 (noting that omissions relating to an opinion’s basis\nare “particularly” likely to give rise to liability when the\nspeaker has “special knowledge of facts unknown to the\nrecipient”); Smith v. Land and House Property Corp.,\n[1884] 28 Ch. D. 7, 15 (App. Cas.) (appeal taken from Eng.)\n(opinion of Bowen, L. J.) (When “the facts are not equally\nknown to both sides, then a statement of opinion by the\none who knows the facts best . . . impliedly states that [the\nspeaker] knows facts which justify his opinion”).11\n——————\n  10 The Restatement of Contracts, discussing misrepresentations that\n\ncan void an agreement, says much the same: “[T]he recipient of an\nassertion of a person’s opinion as to facts not disclosed” may sometimes\n“properly interpret it as an assertion (a) that the facts known to that\nperson are not incompatible with his opinion, or (b) that he knows facts\nsufficient to justify him in forming it.” Restatement (Second) of Con-\ntracts §168, p. 455 (1979).\n  11 In invoking these principles, we disagree with JUSTICE SCALIA’s\n\ncommon-law-based opinion in two crucial ways. First, we view the\ncommon law’s emphasis on special knowledge and expertise as support-\n16        OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n             CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  And the purpose of §11 supports this understanding of\nhow the omissions clause maps onto opinion statements.\nCongress adopted §11 to ensure that issuers “tell[ ] the\nwhole truth” to investors. H. R. Rep. No. 85, 73d Cong.,\n1st Sess., 2 (1933) (quoting President Roosevelt’s message\nto Congress). For that reason, literal accuracy is not\nenough: An issuer must as well desist from misleading\ninvestors by saying one thing and holding back another.\nOmnicare would nullify that statutory requirement for all\nsentences starting with the phrases “we believe” or “we\nthink.” But those magic words can preface nearly any\nconclusion, and the resulting statements, as we have\nshown, remain perfectly capable of misleading investors.\nSee supra, at 11–12. Thus, Omnicare’s view would punch\na hole in the statute for half-truths in the form of opinion\nstatements. And the difficulty of showing that such\nstatements are literally false—which requires proving an\nissuer did not believe them, see supra, at 7–8—would\nmake that opening yet more consequential: Were Omni-\ncare right, companies would have virtual carte blanche to\nassert opinions in registration statements free from worry\n——————\ning, rather than contradicting, our view of what issuers’ opinion state-\nments fairly imply. That is because an issuer has special knowledge of\nits business—including the legal issues the company faces—not avail-\nable to an ordinary investor. Second, we think JUSTICE SCALIA’s reliance\non the common law’s requirement of an intent to deceive is inconsistent\nwith §11’s standard of liability. As we understand him, JUSTICE SCALIA\nwould limit liability for omissions under §11 to cases in which a speaker\n“subjectively intend[s] the deception” arising from the omission, on\nthe ground that the common law did the same. Post, at 6 (opinion\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted).\nBut §11 discards the common law’s intent requirement, making omis-\nsions unlawful—regardless of the issuer’s state of mind—so long as\nthey render statements misleading. See Herman & MacLean, 459\nU. S., at 382 (emphasizing that §11 imposes liability “even for innocent”\nmisstatements or omissions). The common law can help illuminate\nwhen an omission has that effect, but cannot change §11’s insistence on\nstrict liability. See supra, at 14, n. 9.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nabout §11. That outcome would ill-fit Congress’s decision\nto establish a strict liability offense promoting “full and\nfair disclosure” of material information. Pinter, 486 U. S.,\nat 646; see supra, at 1–2.\n   Omnicare argues, in response, that applying §11’s omis-\nsions clause in the way we have described would have\n“adverse policy consequences.” Reply Brief 17 (capitaliza-\ntion omitted). According to Omnicare, any inquiry into the\nissuer’s basis for holding an opinion is “hopelessly amor-\nphous,” threatening “unpredictable” and possibly “mas-\nsive” liability. Id., at 2; Brief for Petitioners 34, 36. And\nbecause that is so, Omnicare claims, many issuers will\nchoose not to disclose opinions at all, thus “depriving\n[investors] of potentially helpful information.” Reply Brief\n19; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 59–61.\n   But first, that claim is, just as Omnicare labels it, one of\n“policy”; and Congress gets to make policy, not the courts.\nThe decision Congress made, for the reasons we have\nindicated, was to extend §11 liability to all statements\nrendered misleading by omission. In doing so, Congress\nno doubt made §11 less cut-and-dry than a law prohibiting\nonly false factual statements. Section 11’s omissions\nclause, as applied to statements of both opinion and fact,\nnecessarily brings the reasonable person into the analysis,\nand asks what she would naturally understand a state-\nment to convey beyond its literal meaning. And for ex-\npressions of opinion, that means considering the founda-\ntion she would expect an issuer to have before making the\nstatement. See supra, at 11–12. All that, however, is a\nfeature, not a bug, of the omissions provision.\n   Moreover, Omnicare way overstates both the looseness\nof the inquiry Congress has mandated and the breadth of\nliability that approach threatens. As we have explained,\nan investor cannot state a claim by alleging only that an\nopinion was wrong; the complaint must as well call into\nquestion the issuer’s basis for offering the opinion. See\n18      OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsupra, at 11–12. And to do so, the investor cannot just say\nthat the issuer failed to reveal its basis. Section 11’s\nomissions clause, after all, is not a general disclosure\nrequirement; it affords a cause of action only when an\nissuer’s failure to include a material fact has rendered a\npublished statement misleading. To press such a claim,\nan investor must allege that kind of omission—and not\nmerely by means of conclusory assertions. See Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 678 (2009) (“Threadbare recitals of\nthe elements of a cause of action, supported by mere con-\nclusory statements, do not suffice”). To be specific: The\ninvestor must identify particular (and material) facts\ngoing to the basis for the issuer’s opinion—facts about the\ninquiry the issuer did or did not conduct or the knowledge\nit did or did not have—whose omission makes the opinion\nstatement at issue misleading to a reasonable person\nreading the statement fairly and in context. See supra, at\n11–14. That is no small task for an investor.\n   Nor does the inquiry such a complaint triggers ask\nanything unusual of courts. Numerous legal rules hinge\non what a reasonable person would think or expect. In\nrequiring courts to view statements of opinion from an\nordinary investor’s perspective, §11’s omissions clause\ndemands nothing more complicated or unmanageable.\nIndeed, courts have for decades engaged in just that in-\nquiry, with no apparent trouble, in applying the common\nlaw of misrepresentation. See supra, at 14–15.\n   Finally, we see no reason to think that liability for\nmisleading opinions will chill disclosures useful to inves-\ntors. Nothing indicates that §11’s application to mislead-\ning factual assertions in registration statements has\ncaused such a problem. And likewise, common-law doc-\ntrines of opinion liability have not, so far as anyone knows,\ndeterred merchants in ordinary commercial transactions\nfrom asserting helpful opinions about their products. That\nabsence of fallout is unsurprising. Sellers (whether of\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstock or other items) have strong economic incentives to\n. . . well, sell (i.e., hawk or peddle). Those market-based\nforces push back against any inclination to underdisclose.\nAnd to avoid exposure for omissions under §11, an issuer\nneed only divulge an opinion’s basis, or else make clear the\nreal tentativeness of its belief. Such ways of conveying\nopinions so that they do not mislead will keep valuable\ninformation flowing. And that is the only kind of infor-\nmation investors need. To the extent our decision today\nchills misleading opinions, that is all to the good: In enact-\ning §11, Congress worked to ensure better, not just more,\ninformation.\n                             B\n   Our analysis on this score counsels in favor of sending\nthe case back to the lower courts for decision. Neither\ncourt below considered the Funds’ omissions theory with\nthe right standard in mind—or indeed, even recognized\nthe distinct statutory questions that theory raises. See\nsupra, at 4–5. We therefore follow our ordinary practice of\nremanding for a determination of whether the Funds have\nstated a viable omissions claim (or, if not, whether they\nshould have a chance to replead).\n   In doing so, however, we reemphasize a few crucial\npoints pertinent to the inquiry on remand. Initially, as we\nhave said, the Funds cannot proceed without identifying\none or more facts left out of Omnicare’s registration\nstatement. See supra, at 17–18. The Funds’ recitation of\nthe statutory language—that Omnicare “omitted to state\nfacts necessary to make the statements made not mislead-\ning”—is not sufficient; neither is the Funds’ conclusory\nallegation that Omnicare lacked “reasonable grounds for\nthe belief ” it stated respecting legal compliance. App.\n273–274. At oral argument, however, the Funds high-\nlighted another, more specific allegation in their com-\nplaint: that an attorney had warned Omnicare that a\n20      OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nparticular contract “carrie[d] a heightened risk” of legal\nexposure under anti-kickback laws. Id., at 225 (emphasis\nomitted); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 42, 49; supra, at 4. On re-\nmand, the court must review the Funds’ complaint to\ndetermine whether it adequately alleged that Omnicare\nhad omitted that (purported) fact, or any other like it,\nfrom the registration statement. And if so, the court must\ndetermine whether the omitted fact would have been\nmaterial to a reasonable investor—i.e., whether “there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that a reasonable [investor] would\nconsider it important.” TSC Industries, 426 U. S., at 449.\n  Assuming the Funds clear those hurdles, the court must\nask whether the alleged omission rendered Omnicare’s\nlegal compliance opinions misleading in the way described\nearlier—i.e., because the excluded fact shows that Om-\nnicare lacked the basis for making those statements that a\nreasonable investor would expect. See supra, at 11–12.\nInsofar as the omitted fact at issue is the attorney’s warn-\ning, that inquiry entails consideration of such matters as\nthe attorney’s status and expertise and other legal infor-\nmation available to Omnicare at the time. See supra, at\n13. Further, the analysis of whether Omnicare’s opinion is\nmisleading must address the statement’s context. See\nsupra, at 14. That means the court must take account of\nwhatever facts Omnicare did provide about legal compli-\nance, as well as any other hedges, disclaimers, or qualifi-\ncations it included in its registration statement. The court\nshould consider, for example, the information Omnicare\noffered that States had initiated enforcement actions\nagainst drug manufacturers for giving rebates to pharma-\ncies, that the Federal Government had expressed concerns\nabout the practice, and that the relevant laws “could “be\ninterpreted in the future in a manner” that would harm\nOmnicare’s business.

S. C. §77k(a). I agree with the Court’s\ndiscussion of what it means for an expression of opinion to\nstate an untrue material fact. But an expression of opin-\nion implies facts (beyond the fact that the speaker believes\nhis opinion) only where a reasonable listener would un-\nderstand it to do so. And it is only when expressions of\nopinion do imply these other facts that they can be “mis-\nleading” without the addition of other “material facts.”\nThe Court’s view would count far more expressions of\nopinion to convey collateral facts than I—or the common\nlaw—would, and I therefore concur only in part.\n   The common law recognized that most listeners hear “I\nbelieve,” “in my estimation,” and other related phrases as\ndisclaiming the assertion of a fact. Hence the (somewhat\noverbroad) common-law rule that a plaintiff cannot estab-\nlish a misrepresentation claim “for misstatements of\nopinion, as distinguished from those of fact.” W. Keeton,\nD. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on\n2        OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n            CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                    Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\nTorts §109, p. 755 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser & Keeton). A\nfraudulent misrepresentation claim based on an expres-\nsion of opinion could lie for the one fact the opinion reli-\nably conveyed: that the speaker in fact held the stated\nopinion. Restatement of Torts §525, Comment c, p. 60\n(1938). And, in some circumstances, the common law\nacknowledged that an expression of opinion reasonably\nimplied “that the maker knows of no fact incompatible\nwith his opinion.” Id. §539(1), at 91. The no-facts-\nincompatible-with-the-opinion standard was a demanding\none; it meant that a speaker’s judgment had to “var[y] so\nfar from the truth that no reasonable man in his position\ncould have such an opinion.” Restatement of Contracts\n§474(b), p. 902, and Comment b (1932). But without more,\na listener could only reasonably interpret expressions of\nopinion as conveying this limited assurance of a speaker’s\nunderstanding of facts.\n   In a few areas, the common law recognized the possibil-\nity that a listener could reasonably infer from an expres-\nsion of opinion not only (1) that the speaker sincerely held\nit, and (2) that the speaker knew of no facts incompatible\nwith the opinion, but also (3) that the speaker had a rea-\nsonable basis for holding the opinion. This exceptional\nrecognition occurred only where it was “very reasonable or\nprobable” that a listener should place special confidence in\na speaker’s opinion. Prosser & Keeton §109, at 760–761.\nThis included two main categories, both of which were\ncarve-outs from the general rule that “the ordinary man\nhas a reasonable competence to form his own opinion,” and\n“is not justified in relying [on] the . . . opinion” of another.\nRestatement of Torts §542, Comment a, at 95. First,\nexpressions of opinion made in the context of a relation-\nship of trust, such as between doctors and patients. Sec-\nond, expressions of opinion made by an expert in his ca-\npacity as an expert (for example, a jeweler’s statement of\nopinion about the value of a diamond). These exceptions\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nallowed a listener to deal with those special expressions of\nopinion as though they were facts. As the leading treatise\nput it, “the ordinary man is free to deal in reliance upon\nthe opinion of an expert jeweler as to the value of a dia-\nmond [or] of an attorney upon a point of law.” Prosser &\nKeeton §109, at 761. But what reasonable person would\nassume that a lawyer’s assessment of a diamond or a\njeweler’s opinion on a point of law implied an educated\ninvestigation?\n   The Court’s expansive application of §11’s omissions\nclause to expressions of opinion produces a far broader\nfield of misrepresentation; in fact, it produces almost the\nopposite of the common-law rule. The Court holds that a\nreasonable investor is right to expect a reasonable basis\nfor all opinions in registration statements—for example,\nthe conduct of a “meaningful . . . inquiry,”—unless that is\nsufficiently disclaimed. Ante, at 12, 14–15, 18–20. Take\nthe Court’s hypothetical opinion regarding legal compli-\nance. When a disclosure statement says “we believe our\nconduct is lawful,” ante, at 12, the Court thinks this\nshould be understood to suggest that a lawyer was con-\nsulted, since a reasonable investigation on this point\nwould require consulting a lawyer. But this approach is\nincompatible with the common law, which had no “legal\nopinions are different” exception. See Restatement of\nTorts §545, at 102.\n   It is also incompatible with common sense. It seems to\nme strange to suggest that a statement of opinion as\ngeneric as “we believe our conduct is lawful” conveys the\nimplied assertion of fact “we have conducted a meaningful\nlegal investigation before espousing this opinion.” It is\nstrange to ignore the reality that a director might rely on\nindustry practice, prior experience, or advice from regula-\ntors—rather than a meaningful legal investigation—in\nconcluding the firm’s conduct is lawful. The effect of the\nCourt’s rule is to adopt a presumption of expertise on all\n4       OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\ntopics volunteered within a registration statement.\n   It is reasonable enough to adopt such a presumption for\nthose matters that are required to be set forth in a regis-\ntration statement. Those are matters on which the man-\nagement of a corporation are experts. If, for example, the\nregistration statement said “we believe that the corpora-\ntion has $5,000,000 cash on hand,” or “we believe the\ncorporation has 7,500 shares of common stock outstand-\ning,” the public is entitled to assume that the management\nhas done the necessary research, so that the asserted\n“belief ” is undoubtedly correct. But of course a registra-\ntion statement would never preface such items, within the\nexpertise of the management, with a “we believe that.”\nFull compliance with the law, however, is another matter.\nIt is not specifically required to be set forth in the state-\nment, and when management prefaces that volunteered\ninformation with a “we believe that,” it flags the fact that\nthis is not within our area of expertise, but we think we\nare in compliance.\n   Moreover, even if one assumes that a corporation issu-\ning a registration statement is (by operation of law) an\n“expert” with regard to all matters stated or opined about,\nI would still not agree with the Court’s disposition. The\nCourt says the following:\n   “Section 11’s omissions clause, as applied to statements\n   of both opinion and fact, necessarily brings the reason-\n   able person into the analysis, and asks what she would\n   naturally understand a statement to convey beyond its\n   literal meaning. And for expressions of opinion, that\n   means considering the foundation she would expect an\n   issuer to have before making the statement.” Ante, at 17\n   (emphasis added).\nThe first sentence is true enough—but “what she [the\nreasonable (female) person, and even he, the reasonable\n(male) person] would naturally understand a statement [of\nopinion] to convey” is not that the statement has the foun-\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    5\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ndation she (the reasonable female person) considers ade-\nquate. She is not an expert, and is relying on the advice of\nan expert—who ought to know how much “foundation” is\nneeded. She would naturally understand that the expert\nhas conducted an investigation that he (or she or it) con-\nsidered adequate. That is what relying upon the opinion\nof an expert means.\n   The common law understood this distinction. An action\nfor fraudulent misrepresentation based on an opinion of\nan expert* was only allowed when the expression of the\nopinion conveyed a fact—the “fact” that summarized the\nexpert’s knowledge. Prosser and Keeton §109, at 761.\nAnd a fact was actionable only if the speaker knew it was\nfalse, if he knew he did not know it, or if he knew the\nlistener would understand the statement to have a basis\nthat the speaker knew was not true. Restatement of Torts\n§526, at 63–64. Ah!, the majority might say, so a speaker\nis liable for knowing he lacks the listener’s reasonable\nbasis! If the speaker knows—is actually aware—that the\nlistener will understand an expression of opinion to have a\nspecific basis that it does not have, then of course he satis-\nfies this element of the tort.\n   But more often, when any basis is implied at all, both\nsides will understand that the speaker implied a “reason-\nable basis,” but honestly disagree on what that means. And\nthe common law supplied a solution for this: A speaker was\nliable for ambiguous statements—misunderstandings—as\n\n——————\n  * At the time of the Act’s passage, the common law did not permit suit\nfor negligent misrepresentation under the circumstances here. An\naction for negligent misrepresentation resting upon a statement of\nopinion would lie only if the opinion—a professional opinion—was\n“given upon facts equally well known to both the supplier and the\nrecipient.” Restatement of Torts §552, Comment b, at 123 (1938). That\nis of course not the situation here. The typical opinion “given upon\nfacts equally known to both the supplier and the recipient” is a lawyer’s\nlegal advice on facts described by his client.\n6       OMNICARE, INC. v. LABORERS DIST. COUNCIL\n\n           CONSTR. INDUSTRY PENSION FUND \n\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\nfraudulent misrepresentations only where he both knew of\nthe ambiguity and intended that the listener fall prey to it.\nId. §527, at 66. In other words, even assuming both parties\nknew (a prerequisite to liability) that the expression of\nopinion implied a “reasonable investigation,” if the speaker\nand listener honestly disagreed on the nature of that inves-\ntigation, the speaker was not liable for a fraudulent misrep-\nresentation unless he subjectively intended the deception.\nAnd so in no circumstance would the listener’s belief of a\n“reasonable basis” control: If the speaker subjectively be-\nlieves he lacks a reasonable basis, then his statement is\nsimply a knowing misrepresentation. Id. §526(a), at 63. If\nhe does not know of the ambiguity, or knows of it, but does\nnot intend to deceive, he is not liable. Id. §527, at 66. That\nhis basis for belief was “objectively unreasonable” does not\nimpart liability, so long as the belief was genuine.\n   This aligns with common sense. When a client receives\nadvice from his lawyer, it is surely implicit in that advice\nthat the lawyer has conducted a reasonable investiga-\ntion—reasonable, that is, in the lawyer’s estimation. The\nclient is relying on the expert lawyer’s judgment for the\namount of investigation necessary, no less than for the\nlegal conclusion. To be sure, if the lawyer conducts an\ninvestigation that he does not believe is adequate, he\nwould be liable for misrepresentation. And if he conducts\nan investigation that he believes is adequate but is objec-\ntively unreasonable (and reaches an incorrect result), he\nmay be liable for malpractice. But on the latter premise\nhe is not liable for misrepresentation; all that was implicit\nin his advice was that he had conducted an investigation\nhe deemed adequate. To rely on an expert’s opinion is to\nrely on the expert’s evaluation of how much time to spend\non the question at hand.\n   The objective test proposed by the Court—inconsistent\nwith the common law and common intuitions about state-\nments of opinion—invites roundabout attacks upon ex-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\npressions of opinion. Litigants seeking recompense for a\ncorporation’s expression of belief that turned out, after the\nfact, to be incorrect can always charge that even though\nthe belief rested upon an investigation the corporation\nthought to be adequate, the investigation was not “objec-\ntively adequate.”\n   Nor is this objective test justified by §11’s absence of a\nmens rea requirement, as the Court suggests. Ante, at 15\nn.10. Some of my citation of the common law is meant to\nillustrate when a statement of opinion contains an implied\nwarranty of reasonable basis. But when it does so, the\nquestion then becomes whose reasonable basis. My illus-\ntration of the common-law requirements for misrepresen-\ntation is meant to show that a typical listener assumes\nthat the speaker’s reasonable basis controls. That show-\ning is not contradicted by §11’s absence of a mens rea\nrequirement.\n   Not to worry, says the Court. Sellers of securities need\n“only divulge an opinion’s basis, or else make clear the\nreal tentativeness of [their] belief[s].” Ante, at 18. One\nwonders what the function of “in my estimation” is, then,\nexcept as divulging such hesitation. Or what would be\nsufficient for the Court. “In my highly tentative estima-\ntion?” “In my estimation that, consistent with Omnicare,\nshould be understood as an opinion only?” Reasonable\nspeakers do not speak this way, and reasonable listeners\ndo not receive opinions this way. When an expert expresses\nan opinion instead of stating a fact, it implies (1) that\nhe genuinely believes the opinion, (2) that he believes his\nbasis for the opinion is sufficient, and (most important) (3)\nthat he is not certain of his result. Nothing more. This\napproach would have given lower courts and investors far\nmore guidance and would largely have avoided the Funds’\nattack upon Omnicare’s opinions as though Omnicare held\nthose opinions out to be facts.\n   I therefore concur only in part and in the judgment.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

S. C. §77k(a); ante, at 6–9. I write\nseparately because I do not think it advisable to opine, as\nthe majority does, on an additional theory of liability that\nis not properly before us.\n   The question whether and under what circumstances an\nomission may make a statement of opinion misleading is\none that we should have left to the lower courts to decide\non remand. As the majority acknowledges, that question\nwas never passed on below. See ante, at 19. With good\nreason: Apart from a few conclusory allegations in their\ncomplaint and some pro forma references to “misleading\nstatements and omissions” in their briefs, respondents did\nnot elaborate on the omissions theory of liability before\neither the District Court or the Court of Appeals. They\ncertainly did not articulate the theory the majority now\nadopts until they filed their merits brief before this Court.\nAnd it was not until oral argument that they identified a\nfactual allegation in their complaint that might serve to\nstate a claim under that theory.

This Court rarely\nprides itself on being a pioneer of novel legal claims, as\n“[o]urs is a court of final review and not first view.” Zivo-\ntofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 12)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, as a general\nrule, “we do not decide in the first instance issues not\ndecided below.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThis includes fashioning innovative theories of liability as\nmuch as it includes applying those theories to the circum-\nstances of the case.\n   The Court has previously relied on a lower court’s fail-\nure to address an issue below as a reason for declining to\naddress it here, even when the question was fairly pre-\nsented in the petition and fully vetted by other lower\ncourts. See, e.g., CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of\nRevenue, 562 U. S. 277, 284, n. 5 (2011); see also id., at\n303, n. 3 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Surely the feature that\ndistinguishes this case—a novel legal theory that is not\nfairly included in the question presented—counsels more\nstrongly in favor of avoidance.\n   As JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence reveals, the scope of\nthis theory of liability is far from certain. And the highly\nfact-intensive nature of the omissions theory provides an\nadditional reason not to address it at this time. The ma-\njority acknowledges that the facts a reasonable investor\nmay infer from a statement of opinion depend on the\ncontext. And yet it opines about certain facts an investor\nmay infer from an issuer’s legal compliance opinion: that\nsuch an opinion is based on legal advice, for example, or\nthat it is not contradicted by the Federal Government.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.
