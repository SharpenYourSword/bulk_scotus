NORTH CAROLINA\n       ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE\n\n           SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\n              No. 14–593.   Decided March 30, 2015\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Petitioner Torrey Dale Grady was convicted in North\nCarolina trial courts of a second degree sexual offense in\n1997 and of taking indecent liberties with a child in 2006.\nAfter serving his sentence for the latter crime, Grady was\nordered to appear in New Hanover County Superior Court\nfor a hearing to determine whether he should be subjected\nto satellite-based monitoring (SBM) as a recidivist sex\noffender. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§14–208.40(a)(1), 14–\n208.40B (2013). Grady did not dispute that his prior\nconvictions rendered him a recidivist under the relevant\nNorth Carolina statutes. He argued, however, that the\nmonitoring program—under which he would be forced to\nwear tracking devices at all times—would violate his\nFourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. Unpersuaded, the trial court or-\ndered Grady to enroll in the program and be monitored for\nthe rest of his life. Record in No. COA13-958 (N. C. App.),\npp. 3–4, 18–22.\n  Grady renewed his Fourth Amendment challenge on\nappeal, relying on this Court’s decision in United States v.\nJones, 565 U. S. ___ (2012). In that case, this Court held\nthat police officers had engaged in a “search” within the\nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment when they installed\nand monitored a Global Positioning System (GPS) track-\ning device on a suspect’s car. The North Carolina Court of\nAppeals rejected Grady’s argument, concluding that it was\nforeclosed by one of its earlier decisions. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 5a–7a. In that decision, coincidentally named State\n2                    GRADY v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nv. Jones, the court had said:\n     “Defendant essentially argues that if affixing a GPS to\n     an individual’s vehicle constitutes a search of the in-\n     dividual, then the arguably more intrusive act of affix-\n     ing an ankle bracelet to an individual must constitute\n     a search of the individual as well. We disagree. The\n     context presented in the instant case—which involves\n     a civil SBM proceeding—is readily distinguishable\n     from that presented in [United States v.] Jones, where\n     the Court considered the propriety of a search in the\n     context of a motion to suppress evidence. We con-\n     clude, therefore, that the specific holding in [United\n     States v.] Jones does not control in the case sub ju-\n     dice.” ___ N. C. App. ___, ___, 750 S. E. 2d 883, 886\n     (2013).\n   The court in Grady’s case held itself bound by this rea-\nsoning and accordingly rejected his Fourth Amendment\nchallenge. App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a–7a. The North Caro-\nlina Supreme Court in turn summarily dismissed Grady’s\nappeal and denied his petition for discretionary review.\n367 N. C. 523, 762 S. E. 2d 460 (2014). Grady now asks us\nto reverse these decisions.*\n   The only explanation provided below for the rejection of\nGrady’s challenge is the quoted passage from State v.\nJones. And the only theory we discern in that passage is\nthat the State’s system of nonconsensual satellite-based\nmonitoring does not entail a search within the meaning of\nthe Fourth Amendment. That theory is inconsistent with\n——————\n   * Grady aims his petition at the decisions of both North Carolina\nappellate courts. See Pet. for Cert. 1. Because we treat the North\nCarolina Supreme Court’s dismissal of an appeal for lack of a substan-\ntial constitutional question as a decision on the merits, it is that court’s\njudgment, rather than the judgment of the Court of Appeals, that is\nsubject to our review under 28 U. S. C. §1257(a). See R. J. Reynolds\nTobacco Co. v. Durham County, 479 U. S. 130, 138–139 (1986).\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthis Court’s precedents.\n   In United States v. Jones, we held that “the Govern-\nment’s installation of a GPS device on a target’s vehicle,\nand its use of that device to monitor the vehicle’s move-\nments, constitutes a ‘search.’ ” 565 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 3) (footnote omitted). We stressed the importance of the\nfact that the Government had “physically occupied private\nproperty for the purpose of obtaining information.” Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 4). Under such circumstances, it was not\nnecessary to inquire about the target’s expectation of\nprivacy in his vehicle’s movements in order to determine if\na Fourth Amendment search had occurred. “Where, as\nhere, the Government obtains information by physically\nintruding on a constitutionally protected area, such a\nsearch has undoubtedly occurred.” Id., at ___, n. 3 (slip\nop., at 6, n. 3).\n   We reaffirmed this principle in Florida v. Jardines, 569\nU. S. ___, ___–___ (2013) (slip op., at 3–4), where we held\nthat having a drug-sniffing dog nose around a suspect’s\nfront porch was a search, because police had “gathered . . .\ninformation by physically entering and occupying the\n[curtilage of the house] to engage in conduct not explicitly\nor implicitly permitted by the homeowner.” See also id., at\n___ (slip op., at 9) (a search occurs “when the government\ngains evidence by physically intruding on constitutionally\nprotected areas”). In light of these decisions, it follows\nthat a State also conducts a search when it attaches a\ndevice to a person’s body, without consent, for the purpose\nof tracking that individual’s movements.\n   In concluding otherwise, the North Carolina Court of\nAppeals apparently placed decisive weight on the fact that\nthe State’s monitoring program is civil in nature. See\nJones, ___ N. C. App., at ___, 750 S. E. 2d, at 886 (“the\ninstant case . . . involves a civil SBM proceeding”). “It is\nwell settled,” however, “that the Fourth Amendment’s\nprotection extends beyond the sphere of criminal investi-\n4                GRADY v.

A building inspector who enters a home simply to\nensure compliance with civil safety regulations has un-\ndoubtedly conducted a search under the Fourth Amend-\nment. See Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County\nof San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523, 534 (1967) (housing in-\nspections are “administrative searches” that must comply\nwith the Fourth Amendment).\n   In its brief in opposition to certiorari, the State faults\nGrady for failing to introduce “evidence about the State’s\nimplementation of the SBM program or what information,\nif any, it currently obtains through the monitoring pro-\ncess.” Brief in Opposition 11. Without evidence that it is\nacting to obtain information, the State argues, “there is no\nbasis upon which this Court can determine whether North\nCarolina conducts a ‘search’ of an offender enrolled in its\nSBM program.” Ibid. (citing Jones, 565 U. S., at ___, n. 5\n(slip op., at 7, n. 5) (noting that a government intrusion is\nnot a search unless “done to obtain information”)). In\nother words, the State argues that we cannot be sure its\nprogram for satellite-based monitoring of sex offenders\ncollects any information. If the very name of the program\ndoes not suffice to rebut this contention, the text of the\nstatute surely does:\n    “The satellite-based monitoring program shall use a\n    system that provides all of the following:\n      “(1) Time-correlated and continuous tracking of the\n    geographic location of the subject . . . .\n      “(2) Reporting of subject’s violations of prescriptive\n    and proscriptive schedule or location requirements.”\n    N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §14–208.40(c).\nThe State’s program is plainly designed to obtain infor-\nmation. And since it does so by physically intruding on a\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

The Fourth\nAmendment prohibits only unreasonable searches. The\nreasonableness of a search depends on the totality of the\ncircumstances, including the nature and purpose of the\nsearch and the extent to which the search intrudes upon\nreasonable privacy expectations. See, e.g., Samson v.\nCalifornia, 547 U. S. 843 (2006) (suspicionless search of\nparolee was reasonable); Vernonia School Dist. 47J v.\nActon, 515 U.

The North Carolina courts\ndid not examine whether the State’s monitoring program\nis reasonable—when properly viewed as a search—and we\nwill not do so in the first instance.\n   The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of\nthe Supreme Court of North Carolina is vacated, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 2789928, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/03/30/grady_v._north_carolina.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 575 U.
