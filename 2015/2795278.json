UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 13–9972. Argued January 21, 2015—Decided April 21, 2015\nOfficer Struble, a K–9 officer, stopped petitioner Rodriguez for driving\n  on a highway shoulder, a violation of Nebraska law. After Struble at-\n  tended to everything relating to the stop, including, inter alia, check-\n  ing the driver’s licenses of Rodriguez and his passenger and issuing a\n  warning for the traffic offense, he asked Rodriguez for permission to\n  walk his dog around the vehicle. When Rodriguez refused, Struble\n  detained him until a second officer arrived. Struble then retrieved\n  his dog, who alerted to the presence of drugs in the vehicle. The en-\n  suing search revealed methamphetamine. Seven or eight minutes\n  elapsed from the time Struble issued the written warning until the\n  dog alerted.\n     Rodriguez was indicted on federal drug charges. He moved to sup-\n  press the evidence seized from the vehicle on the ground, among oth-\n  ers, that Struble had prolonged the traffic stop without reasonable\n  suspicion in order to conduct the dog sniff. The Magistrate Judge\n  recommended denial of the motion. He found no reasonable suspicion\n  supporting detention once Struble issued the written warning. Un-\n  der Eighth Circuit precedent, however, he concluded that prolonging\n  the stop by “seven to eight minutes” for the dog sniff was only a de\n  minimis intrusion on Rodriguez’s Fourth Amendment rights and was\n  for that reason permissible. The District Court then denied the mo-\n  tion to suppress. Rodriguez entered a conditional guilty plea and was\n  sentenced to five years in prison. The Eighth Circuit affirmed. Not-\n  ing that the seven or eight minute delay was an acceptable “de mini-\n  mis intrusion on Rodriguez’s personal liberty,” the court declined to\n  reach the question whether Struble had reasonable suspicion to con-\n  tinue Rodriguez’s detention after issuing the written warning.\nHeld:\n2                    RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n         1. Absent reasonable suspicion, police extension of a traffic stop\n    in order to conduct a dog sniff violates the Constitution’s shield\n    against unreasonable seizures.\n       A routine traffic stop is more like a brief stop under Terry v. Ohio,\n    392 U. S. 1, than an arrest, see, e.g., Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U. S.\n    323, 330. Its tolerable duration is determined by the seizure’s “mis-\n    sion,” which is to address the traffic violation that warranted the\n    stop, Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407 and attend to related\n    safety concerns. Authority for the seizure ends when tasks tied to\n    the traffic infraction are—or reasonably should have been—\n    completed. The Fourth Amendment may tolerate certain unrelated\n    investigations that do not lengthen the roadside detention, Johnson,\n    555 U. S., at 327–328 (questioning); Caballes, 543 U. S., at 406, 408\n    (dog sniff), but a traffic stop “become[s] unlawful if it is prolonged be-\n    yond the time reasonably required to complete th[e] mission” of issu-\n    ing a warning ticket, id., at 407.\n       Beyond determining whether to issue a traffic ticket, an officer’s\n    mission during a traffic stop typically includes checking the driver’s\n    license, determining whether there are outstanding warrants against\n    the driver, and inspecting the automobile’s registration and proof of\n    insurance. These checks serve the same objective as enforcement of\n    the traffic code: ensuring that vehicles on the road are operated safe-\n    ly and responsibly. See Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 658–659.\n    Lacking the same close connection to roadway safety as the ordinary\n    inquiries, a dog sniff is not fairly characterized as part of the officer’s\n    traffic mission.\n       In concluding that the de minimis intrusion here could be offset by\n    the Government’s interest in stopping the flow of illegal drugs, the\n    Eighth Circuit relied on Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106. The\n    Court reasoned in Mimms that the government’s “legitimate and\n    weighty” interest in officer safety outweighed the “de minimis” addi-\n    tional intrusion of requiring a driver, lawfully stopped, to exit a vehi-\n    cle, id., at 110–111. The officer-safety interest recognized in Mimms,\n    however, stemmed from the danger to the officer associated with the\n    traffic stop itself. On-scene investigation into other crimes, in con-\n    trast, detours from the officer’s traffic-control mission and therefore\n    gains no support from Mimms.\n       The Government’s argument that an officer who completes all traf-\n    fic-related tasks expeditiously should earn extra time to pursue an\n    unrelated criminal investigation is unpersuasive, for a traffic stop\n    “prolonged beyond” the time in fact needed for the officer to complete\n    his traffic-based inquiries is “unlawful,” Caballes, 543 U. S., at 407.\n    The critical question is not whether the dog sniff occurs before or af-\n    ter the officer issues a ticket, but whether conducting the sniff adds\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

The determination adopted by the District Court that deten-\n  tion for the dog sniff was not independently supported by individual-\n  ized suspicion was not reviewed by the Eighth Circuit.

Caballes, 543 U. S. 405 (2005), this Court\nheld that a dog sniff conducted during a lawful traffic stop\ndoes not violate the Fourth Amendment’s proscription of\nunreasonable seizures. This case presents the question\nwhether the Fourth Amendment tolerates a dog sniff\nconducted after completion of a traffic stop. We hold that\na police stop exceeding the time needed to handle the\nmatter for which the stop was made violates the Constitu­\ntion’s shield against unreasonable seizures. A seizure\njustified only by a police-observed traffic violation, there­\nfore, “become[s] unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time\nreasonably required to complete th[e] mission” of issuing a\nticket for the violation. Id., at 407. The Court so recog­\nnized in Caballes, and we adhere to the line drawn in that\ndecision.\n                            I\n  Just after midnight on March 27, 2012, police officer\nMorgan Struble observed a Mercury Mountaineer veer\nslowly onto the shoulder of Nebraska State Highway 275\nfor one or two seconds and then jerk back onto the road.\n2               RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nNebraska law prohibits driving on highway shoulders, see\nNeb. Rev. Stat. §60–6,142 (2010), and on that basis, Stru­\nble pulled the Mountaineer over at 12:06 a.m. Struble is a\nK–9 officer with the Valley Police Department in Ne­\nbraska, and his dog Floyd was in his patrol car that night.\nTwo men were in the Mountaineer: the driver, Dennys\nRodriguez, and a front-seat passenger, Scott Pollman.\n   Struble approached the Mountaineer on the passenger’s\nside. After Rodriguez identified himself, Struble asked\nhim why he had driven onto the shoulder. Rodriguez\nreplied that he had swerved to avoid a pothole. Struble\nthen gathered Rodriguez’s license, registration, and proof\nof insurance, and asked Rodriguez to accompany him to\nthe patrol car. Rodriguez asked if he was required to do\nso, and Struble answered that he was not. Rodriguez\ndecided to wait in his own vehicle.\n   After running a records check on Rodriguez, Struble\nreturned to the Mountaineer. Struble asked passenger\nPollman for his driver’s license and began to question him\nabout where the two men were coming from and where\nthey were going. Pollman replied that they had traveled\nto Omaha, Nebraska, to look at a Ford Mustang that was\nfor sale and that they were returning to Norfolk, Ne­\nbraska. Struble returned again to his patrol car, where he\ncompleted a records check on Pollman, and called for a\nsecond officer. Struble then began writing a warning\nticket for Rodriguez for driving on the shoulder of the\nroad.\n   Struble returned to Rodriguez’s vehicle a third time to\nissue the written warning. By 12:27 or 12:28 a.m., Struble\nhad finished explaining the warning to Rodriguez, and\nhad given back to Rodriguez and Pollman the documents\nobtained from them. As Struble later testified, at that\npoint, Rodriguez and Pollman “had all their documents\nback and a copy of the written warning. I got all the\nreason[s] for the stop out of the way[,] . . . took care of all\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe business.” App. 70.\n  Nevertheless, Struble did not consider Rodriguez “free\nto leave.” Id., at 69–70. Although justification for the\ntraffic stop was “out of the way,” id., at 70, Struble asked\nfor permission to walk his dog around Rodriguez’s vehicle.\nRodriguez said no. Struble then instructed Rodriguez to\nturn off the ignition, exit the vehicle, and stand in front of\nthe patrol car to wait for the second officer. Rodriguez\ncomplied. At 12:33 a.m., a deputy sheriff arrived. Struble\nretrieved his dog and led him twice around the Moun­\ntaineer. The dog alerted to the presence of drugs halfway\nthrough Struble’s second pass. All told, seven or eight\nminutes had elapsed from the time Struble issued the\nwritten warning until the dog indicated the presence of\ndrugs. A search of the vehicle revealed a large bag of\nmethamphetamine.\n  Rodriguez was indicted in the United States District\nCourt for the District of Nebraska on one count of posses­\nsion with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth­\namphetamine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. §§841(a)(1) and\n(b)(1). He moved to suppress the evidence seized from his\ncar on the ground, among others, that Struble had pro­\nlonged the traffic stop without reasonable suspicion in\norder to conduct the dog sniff.\n  After receiving evidence, a Magistrate Judge recom­\nmended that the motion be denied. The Magistrate Judge\nfound no probable cause to search the vehicle independent\nof the dog alert. App. 100 (apart from “information given\nby the dog,” “Officer Struble had [no]thing other than a\nrather large hunch”). He further found that no reasonable\nsuspicion supported the detention once Struble issued the\nwritten warning. He concluded, however, that under\nEighth Circuit precedent, extension of the stop by “seven\nto eight minutes” for the dog sniff was only a de minimis\nintrusion on Rodriguez’s Fourth Amendment rights and\nwas therefore permissible.\n4              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s\nfactual findings and legal conclusions and denied Rodri­\nguez’s motion to suppress. The court noted that, in the\nEighth Circuit, “dog sniffs that occur within a short time\nfollowing the completion of a traffic stop are not constitu­\ntionally prohibited if they constitute only de minimis\nintrusions.” App. 114 (quoting United States v. Alexander,\n448 F. 3d 1014, 1016 (CA8 2006)). The court thus agreed\nwith the Magistrate Judge that the “7 to 10 minutes”\nadded to the stop by the dog sniff “was not of constitu­\ntional significance.” App. 114. Impelled by that decision,\nRodriguez entered a conditional guilty plea and was sen­\ntenced to five years in prison.\n   The Eighth Circuit affirmed. The “seven- or eight-\nminute delay” in this case, the opinion noted, resembled\ndelays that the court had previously ranked as permissi­\nble. 741 F. 3d 905, 907 (2014). The Court of Appeals thus\nruled that the delay here constituted an acceptable “de\nminimis intrusion on Rodriguez’s personal liberty.” Id., at\n908. Given that ruling, the court declined to reach the\nquestion whether Struble had reasonable suspicion to\ncontinue Rodriguez’s detention after issuing the written\nwarning.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a division among lower\ncourts on the question whether police routinely may ex­\ntend an otherwise-completed traffic stop, absent reason­\nable suspicion, in order to conduct a dog sniff. 573 U. S. ___\n(2014). Compare, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 270 F. 3d\n625, 632 (CA8 2001) (postcompletion delay of “well under\nten minutes” permissible), with, e.g., State v. Baker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600016\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600016/state-v-baker/\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">UT</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶13, 229 P. 3d 650, 658 (2010) (“[W]ithout addi­\ntional reasonable suspicion, the officer must allow the\nseized person to depart once the purpose of the stop has\nconcluded.”).\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                                II\n   A seizure for a traffic violation justifies a police investi­\ngation of that violation. “[A] relatively brief encounter,” a\nroutine traffic stop is “more analogous to a so-called ‘Terry\nstop’ . . . than to a formal arrest.” Knowles v. Iowa, 525\nU. S. 113, 117 (1998) (quoting Berkemer v. McCarty, 468\nU. S. 420, 439 (1984), in turn citing Terry v. Ohio, 392\nU. S. 1 (1968)). See also Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U. S.\n323, 330 (2009). Like a Terry stop, the tolerable duration\nof police inquiries in the traffic-stop context is determined\nby the seizure’s “mission”—to address the traffic violation\nthat warranted the stop, Caballes, 543 U. S., at 407, and\nattend to related safety concerns, infra, at 6–7. See also\nUnited States v. Sharpe, 470 U. S. 675, 685 (1985); Florida\nv. Royer, 460 U. S. 491, 500 (1983) (plurality opinion)\n(“The scope of the detention must be carefully tailored to\nits underlying justification.”). Because addressing the\ninfraction is the purpose of the stop, it may “last no longer\nthan is necessary to effectuate th[at] purpose.” Ibid. See\nalso Caballes, 543 U. S., at 407. Authority for the seizure\nthus ends when tasks tied to the traffic infraction are—or\nreasonably should have been—completed. See Sharpe,\n470 U. S., at 686 (in determining the reasonable duration\nof a stop, “it [is] appropriate to examine whether the police\ndiligently pursued [the] investigation”).\n   Our decisions in Caballes and Johnson heed these con­\nstraints. In both cases, we concluded that the Fourth\nAmendment tolerated certain unrelated investigations\nthat did not lengthen the roadside detention. Johnson,\n555 U. S., at 327–328 (questioning); Caballes, 543 U. S., at\n406, 408 (dog sniff). In Caballes, however, we cautioned\nthat a traffic stop “can become unlawful if it is prolonged\nbeyond the time reasonably required to complete th[e]\nmission” of issuing a warning ticket. 543 U. S., at 407.\nAnd we repeated that admonition in Johnson: The seizure\nremains lawful only “so long as [unrelated] inquiries do\n6              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot measurably extend the duration of the stop.” 555\nU. S., at 333. See also Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 101\n(2005) (because unrelated inquiries did not “exten[d] the\ntime [petitioner] was detained[,] . . . no additional Fourth\nAmendment justification . . . was required”). An officer, in\nother words, may conduct certain unrelated checks during\nan otherwise lawful traffic stop. But contrary to JUSTICE\nALITO’s suggestion, post, at 4, n. 2, he may not do so in a\nway that prolongs the stop, absent the reasonable suspi­\ncion ordinarily demanded to justify detaining an individ­\nual. But see post, at 1–2 (ALITO, J., dissenting) (premising\nopinion on the dissent’s own finding of “reasonable suspi­\ncion,” although the District Court reached the opposite\nconclusion, and the Court of Appeals declined to consider\nthe issue).\n  Beyond determining whether to issue a traffic ticket, an\nofficer’s mission includes “ordinary inquiries incident to\n[the traffic] stop.” Caballes, 543 U. S., at 408. Typically\nsuch inquiries involve checking the driver’s license, de­\ntermining whether there are outstanding warrants\nagainst the driver, and inspecting the automobile’s regis­\ntration and proof of insurance. See Delaware v. Prouse,\n440 U. S. 648, 658–660 (1979). See also 4 W. LaFave,\nSearch and Seizure §9.3(c), pp. 507–517 (5th ed. 2012).\nThese checks serve the same objective as enforcement of\nthe traffic code: ensuring that vehicles on the road are\noperated safely and responsibly. See Prouse, 440 U. S., at\n658–659; LaFave, Search and Seizure §9.3(c), at 516 (A\n“warrant check makes it possible to determine whether\nthe apparent traffic violator is wanted for one or more\nprevious traffic offenses.”).\n   A dog sniff, by contrast, is a measure aimed at “de­\ntect[ing] evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing.”\nIndianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, 40–41 (2000). See\nalso Florida v. Jardines, 569 U. S. 1, ___–___ (2013) (slip\nop., at 7–8). Candidly, the Government acknowledged at\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noral argument that a dog sniff, unlike the routine\nmeasures just mentioned, is not an ordinary incident of a\ntraffic stop. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. Lacking the same\nclose connection to roadway safety as the ordinary inquir­\nies, a dog sniff is not fairly characterized as part of the\nofficer’s traffic mission.\n   In advancing its de minimis rule, the Eighth Circuit\nrelied heavily on our decision in Pennsylvania v. Mimms,\n434 U. S. 106 (1977) (per curiam). See United States v.\n$404,905.00 in U. S. Currency, 182 F. 3d 643, 649 (CA8\n1999). In Mimms, we reasoned that the government’s\n“legitimate and weighty” interest in officer safety out­\nweighs the “de minimis” additional intrusion of requiring\na driver, already lawfully stopped, to exit the vehicle. 434\nU. S., at 110–111. See also Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S.\n408, 413–415 (1997) (passengers may be required to exit\nvehicle stopped for traffic violation). The Eighth Circuit,\nechoed in JUSTICE THOMAS’s dissent, believed that the\nimposition here similarly could be offset by the Govern­\nment’s “strong interest in interdicting the flow of illegal\ndrugs along the nation’s highways.” $404,905.00 in U. S.\nCurrency, 182 F. 3d, at 649; see post, at 9.\n   Unlike a general interest in criminal enforcement,\nhowever, the government’s officer safety interest stems\nfrom the mission of the stop itself. Traffic stops are “espe­\ncially fraught with danger to police officers,” Johnson, 555\nU. S., at 330 (internal quotation marks omitted), so an\nofficer may need to take certain negligibly burdensome\nprecautions in order to complete his mission safely. Cf.\nUnited States v. Holt, 264 F. 3d 1215, 1221–1222 (CA10\n2001) (en banc) (recognizing officer safety justification for\ncriminal record and outstanding warrant checks), abro­\ngated on other grounds as recognized in United States v.\nStewart, 473 F. 3d 1265, 1269 (CA10 2007). On-scene\ninvestigation into other crimes, however, detours from\nthat mission. See supra, at 6–7. So too do safety precau­\n8              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntions taken in order to facilitate such detours. But cf. post,\nat 2–3 (ALITO, J., dissenting). Thus, even assuming that\nthe imposition here was no more intrusive than the exit\norder in Mimms, the dog sniff could not be justified on the\nsame basis. Highway and officer safety are interests\ndifferent in kind from the Government’s endeavor to de­\ntect crime in general or drug trafficking in particular.\n   The Government argues that an officer may “incremen­\ntal[ly]” prolong a stop to conduct a dog sniff so long as the\nofficer is reasonably diligent in pursuing the traffic-related\npurpose of the stop, and the overall duration of the stop\nremains reasonable in relation to the duration of other\ntraffic stops involving similar circumstances. Brief for\nUnited States 36–39. The Government’s argument, in\neffect, is that by completing all traffic-related tasks expe­\nditiously, an officer can earn bonus time to pursue an\nunrelated criminal investigation. See also post, at 2–5\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (embracing the Government’s\nargument). The reasonableness of a seizure, however,\ndepends on what the police in fact do. See Knowles, 525\nU. S., at 115–117.       In this regard, the Government\nacknowledges that “an officer always has to be reasonably\ndiligent.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 49. How could diligence be\ngauged other than by noting what the officer actually did\nand how he did it? If an officer can complete traffic-based\ninquiries expeditiously, then that is the amount of “time\nreasonably required to complete [the stop’s] mission.”\nCaballes, 543 U. S., at 407. As we said in Caballes and\nreiterate today, a traffic stop “prolonged beyond” that\npoint is “unlawful.” Ibid. The critical question, then, is\nnot whether the dog sniff occurs before or after the officer\nissues a ticket, as JUSTICE ALITO supposes, post, at 2–4,\nbut whether conducting the sniff “prolongs”—i.e., adds\ntime to—“the stop,” supra, at 6.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 408\n(2005). The only question here is whether an officer exe-\ncuted a stop in a reasonable manner when he waited to\nconduct a dog sniff until after he had given the driver a\nwritten warning and a backup unit had arrived, bringing\nthe overall duration of the stop to 29 minutes. Because\nthe stop was reasonably executed, no Fourth Amendment\nviolation occurred. The Court’s holding to the contrary\ncannot be reconciled with our decision in Caballes or a\nnumber of common police practices. It was also unneces-\nsary, as the officer possessed reasonable suspicion to\ncontinue to hold the driver to conduct the dog sniff. I\nrespectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  The Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the\npeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.”\nU. S. Const., Amdt. 4. As the text indicates, and as we\n2              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nhave repeatedly confirmed, “the ultimate touchstone of the\nFourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness.’ ” Brigham City v.\nStuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006). We have defined rea-\nsonableness “in objective terms by examining the totality\nof the circumstances,” Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 39\n(1996), and by considering “the traditional protections\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures afforded by\nthe common law at the time of the framing,” Atwater v.\nLago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 326 (2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). When traditional protections have not\nprovided a definitive answer, our precedents have “ana-\nlyzed a search or seizure in light of traditional standards\nof reasonableness by assessing, on the one hand, the de-\ngree to which it intrudes upon an individual’s privacy and,\non the other, the degree to which it is needed for the pro-\nmotion of legitimate governmental interests.” Virginia v.\nMoore, 553 U. S. 164, 171 (2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Although a traffic stop “constitutes a ‘seizure’ of ‘per-\nsons’ within the meaning of [the Fourth Amendment],”\nsuch a seizure is constitutionally “reasonable where the\npolice have probable cause to believe that a traffic viola-\ntion has occurred.” Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806,\n809–810 (1996). But “a seizure that is lawful at its incep-\ntion can violate the Fourth Amendment if its manner of\nexecution unreasonably infringes interests protected by\nthe Constitution.” Caballes, supra, at 407.\n   Because Rodriguez does not dispute that Officer Struble\nhad probable cause to stop him, the only question is\nwhether the stop was otherwise executed in a reasonable\nmanner. See Brief for Appellant in No. 13–1176 (CA8),\np. 4, n. 2. I easily conclude that it was. Approximately 29\nminutes passed from the time Officer Struble stopped\nRodriguez until his narcotics-detection dog alerted to the\npresence of drugs. That amount of time is hardly out of\nthe ordinary for a traffic stop by a single officer of a vehi-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncle containing multiple occupants even when no dog sniff\nis involved. See, e.g., United States v. Ellis, 497 F. 3d 606\n(CA6 2007) (22 minutes); United States v. Barragan, 379\nF. 3d 524 (CA8 2004) (approximately 30 minutes). During\nthat time, Officer Struble conducted the ordinary activities\nof a traffic stop—he approached the vehicle, questioned\nRodriguez about the observed violation, asked Pollman\nabout their travel plans, ran serial warrant checks on\nRodriguez and Pollman, and issued a written warning to\nRodriguez. And when he decided to conduct a dog sniff, he\ntook the precaution of calling for backup out of concern for\nhis safety. See 741 F. 3d 905, 907 (CA8 2014); see also\nPennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 110 (1977) (per\ncuriam) (officer safety is a “legitimate and weighty” con-\ncern relevant to reasonableness).\n   As Caballes makes clear, the fact that Officer Struble\nwaited until after he gave Rodriguez the warning to con-\nduct the dog sniff does not alter this analysis. Because\n“the use of a well-trained narcotics-detection dog . . . gen-\nerally does not implicate legitimate privacy interests,” 543\nU. S., at 409, “conducting a dog sniff would not change the\ncharacter of a traffic stop that is lawful at its inception\nand otherwise executed in a reasonable manner,” id., at\n408. The stop here was “lawful at its inception and other-\nwise executed in a reasonable manner.” Ibid. As in Ca-\nballes, “conducting a dog sniff [did] not change the charac-\nter of [the] traffic stop,” ibid., and thus no Fourth\nAmendment violation occurred.\n                             II\n  Rather than adhere to the reasonableness requirement\nthat we have repeatedly characterized as the “touchstone\nof the Fourth Amendment,” Brigham City, supra, at 403,\nthe majority constructed a test of its own that is incon-\nsistent with our precedents.\n4              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\n                               A\n\n   The majority’s rule requires a traffic stop to “en[d] when\ntasks tied to the traffic infraction are—or reasonably\nshould have been—completed.” Ante, at 5. “If an officer\ncan complete traffic-based inquiries expeditiously, then\nthat is the amount of time reasonably required to complete\nthe stop’s mission” and he may hold the individual no\nlonger. Ante, at 8 (internal quotation marks and altera-\ntions omitted). The majority’s rule thus imposes a one-\nway ratchet for constitutional protection linked to the\ncharacteristics of the individual officer conducting the\nstop: If a driver is stopped by a particularly efficient of-\nficer, then he will be entitled to be released from the traf-\nfic stop after a shorter period of time than a driver stopped\nby a less efficient officer. Similarly, if a driver is stopped\nby an officer with access to technology that can shorten a\nrecords check, then he will be entitled to be released from\nthe stop after a shorter period of time than an individual\nstopped by an officer without access to such technology.\n   I “cannot accept that the search and seizure protections\nof the Fourth Amendment are so variable and can be made\nto turn upon such trivialities.” Whren, 517 U. S., at 815\n(citations omitted). We have repeatedly explained that the\nreasonableness inquiry must not hinge on the characteris-\ntics of the individual officer conducting the seizure. We\nhave held, for example, that an officer’s state of mind\n“does not invalidate [an] action taken as long as the cir-\ncumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action.” Id., at\n813 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have spurned\ntheories that would make the Fourth Amendment “change\nwith local law enforcement practices.” Moore, supra, at\n172. And we have rejected a rule that would require the\noffense establishing probable cause to be “closely related\nto” the offense identified by the arresting officer, as such a\nrule would make “the constitutionality of an arrest . . .\nvary from place to place and from time to time, depending\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\non whether the arresting officer states the reason for the\ndetention and, if so, whether he correctly identifies a\ngeneral class of offense for which probable cause exists.”\nDevenpeck v. Alford, 543 U. S. 146, 154 (2004) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). In Devenpeck, a\nunanimous Court explained: “An arrest made by a knowl-\nedgeable, veteran officer would be valid, whereas an arrest\nmade by a rookie in precisely the same circumstances\nwould not. We see no reason to ascribe to the Fourth\nAmendment such arbitrarily variable protection.” Ibid.\n  The majority’s logic would produce similarly arbitrary\nresults. Under its reasoning, a traffic stop made by a\nrookie could be executed in a reasonable manner, whereas\nthe same traffic stop made by a knowledgeable, veteran\nofficer in precisely the same circumstances might not, if in\nfact his knowledge and experience made him capable of\ncompleting the stop faster. We have long rejected inter-\npretations of the Fourth Amendment that would produce\nsuch haphazard results, and I see no reason to depart from\nour consistent practice today.\n                              B\n   As if that were not enough, the majority also limits the\nduration of the stop to the time it takes the officer to\ncomplete a narrow category of “traffic-based inquiries.”\nAnte, at 8. According to the majority, these inquiries\ninclude those that “serve the same objective as enforce-\nment of the traffic code: ensuring that vehicles on the road\nare operated safely and responsibly.” Ante, at 6. Inquiries\ndirected to “detecting evidence of ordinary criminal\nwrongdoing” are not traffic-related inquiries and thus\ncannot count toward the overall duration of the stop. Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).\n   The combination of that definition of traffic-related\ninquiries with the majority’s officer-specific durational\nlimit produces a result demonstrably at odds with our\n6               RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndecision in Caballes. Caballes expressly anticipated that a\ntraffic stop could be reasonably prolonged for officers to\nengage in a dog sniff. We explained that no Fourth\nAmendment violation had occurred in Caballes, where the\n“duration of the stop . . . was entirely justified by the\ntraffic offense and the ordinary inquiries incident to such\na stop,” but suggested a different result might attend a\ncase “involving a dog sniff that occurred during an unrea-\nsonably prolonged traffic stop.” 543 U. S., at 407–408\n(emphasis added). The dividing line was whether the\noverall duration of the stop exceeded “the time reasonably\nrequired to complete th[e] mission,” id., at 407, not, as the\nmajority suggests, whether the duration of the stop “in\nfact” exceeded the time necessary to complete the traffic-\nrelated inquiries, ante, at 8.\n   The majority’s approach draws an artificial line between\ndog sniffs and other common police practices. The lower\ncourts have routinely confirmed that warrant checks are a\nconstitutionally permissible part of a traffic stop, see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Simmons, 172 F. 3d 775, 778 (CA11\n1999); United States v. Mendez, 118 F. 3d 1426, 1429\n(CA10 1997); United States v. Shabazz, 993 F. 2d 431, 437\n(CA5 1993), and the majority confirms that it finds no\nfault in these measures, ante, at 6. Yet its reasoning\nsuggests the opposite. Such warrant checks look more like\nthey are directed to “detecting evidence of ordinary crimi-\nnal wrongdoing” than to “ensuring that vehicles on the\nroad are operated safely and responsibly.” Ante, at 6\n(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Per-\nhaps one could argue that the existence of an outstanding\nwarrant might make a driver less likely to operate his\nvehicle safely and responsibly on the road, but the same\ncould be said about a driver in possession of contraband.\nA driver confronted by the police in either case might try\nto flee or become violent toward the officer. But under the\nmajority’s analysis, a dog sniff, which is directed at uncov-\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nering that problem, is not treated as a traffic-based in-\nquiry. Warrant checks, arguably, should fare no better.\nThe majority suggests that a warrant check is an ordinary\ninquiry incident to a traffic stop because it can be used “ ‘to\ndetermine whether the apparent traffic violator is wanted\nfor one or more previous traffic offenses.’ ” Ante, at 6\n(quoting 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §9.3(c), p. 516\n(5th ed. 2012)). But as the very treatise on which the\nmajority relies notes, such checks are a “manifest[ation of]\nthe ‘war on drugs’ motivation so often underlying [routine\ntraffic] stops,” and thus are very much like the dog sniff in\nthis case. Id., §9.3(c), at 507–508.\n   Investigative questioning rests on the same basis as the\ndog sniff. “Asking questions is an essential part of police\ninvestigations.” Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of\nNev., Humboldt Cty., 542 U. S. 177, 185 (2004). And the\nlower courts have routinely upheld such questioning dur-\ning routine traffic stops. See, e.g., United States v. Rivera,\n570 F. 3d 1009, 1013 (CA8 2009); United States v. Childs,\n277 F. 3d 947, 953–954 (CA7 2002). The majority’s rea-\nsoning appears to allow officers to engage in some ques-\ntioning aimed at detecting evidence of ordinary criminal\nwrongdoing. Ante, at 5. But it is hard to see how such\ninquiries fall within the “seizure’s ‘mission’ [of ] ad-\ndress[ing] the traffic violation that warranted the stop,” or\n“attend[ing] to related safety concerns.” Ibid. Its reason-\ning appears to come down to the principle that dogs are\ndifferent.\n                             C\n   On a more fundamental level, the majority’s inquiry\nelides the distinction between traffic stops based on prob-\nable cause and those based on reasonable suspicion.\nProbable cause is the “traditional justification” for the\nseizure of a person. Whren, 517 U. S., at 817 (emphasis\ndeleted); see also Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200,\n8               RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n207–208 (1979). This Court created an exception to that\nrule in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), permitting “police\nofficers who suspect criminal activity to make limited\nintrusions on an individual’s personal security based on\nless than probable cause,” Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S.\n692, 698 (1981). Reasonable suspicion is the justification\nfor such seizures. Prado Navarette v. California, 572 U. S.\n___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 3).\n   Traffic stops can be initiated based on probable cause or\nreasonable suspicion. Although the Court has commented\nthat a routine traffic stop is “more analogous to a so-called\n‘Terry stop’ than to a formal arrest,” it has rejected the\nnotion “that a traffic stop supported by probable cause\nmay not exceed the bounds set by the Fourth Amendment\non the scope of a Terry stop.” Berkemer v. McCarty, 468\nU. S. 420, 439, and n. 29 (1984) (citation omitted).\n   Although all traffic stops must be executed reasonably,\nour precedents make clear that traffic stops justified by\nreasonable suspicion are subject to additional limitations\nthat those justified by probable cause are not. A traffic\nstop based on reasonable suspicion, like all Terry stops,\nmust be “justified at its inception” and “reasonably related\nin scope to the circumstances which justified the interfer-\nence in the first place.” Hiibel, 542 U. S., at 185 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). It also “cannot continue for an\nexcessive period of time or resemble a traditional arrest.”\nId., at 185–186 (citation omitted). By contrast, a stop\nbased on probable cause affords an officer considerably\nmore leeway. In such seizures, an officer may engage in a\nwarrantless arrest of the driver, Atwater, 532 U. S., at\n354, a warrantless search incident to arrest of the driver,\nRiley v. California, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 5),\nand a warrantless search incident to arrest of the vehicle\nif it is reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime\nof arrest might be found there, Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S.\n332, 335 (2009).\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             9\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   The majority casually tosses this distinction aside. It\nasserts that the traffic stop in this case, which was undis-\nputedly initiated on the basis of probable cause, can last\nno longer than is in fact necessary to effectuate the mis-\nsion of the stop. Ante, at 8. And, it assumes that the\nmission of the stop was merely to write a traffic ticket,\nrather than to consider making a custodial arrest. Ante,\nat 5. In support of that durational requirement, it relies\nprimarily on cases involving Terry stops. See ante, at 5–7\n(citing Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U. S. 323 (2009) (analyzing\n“stop and frisk” of passenger in a vehicle temporarily\nseized for a traffic violation); United States v. Sharpe, 470\nU. S. 675 (1985) (analyzing seizure of individuals based on\nsuspicion of marijuana trafficking); Florida v. Royer, 460\nU. S. 491 (1983) (plurality opinion) (analyzing seizure of\nman walking through airport on suspicion of narcotics\nactivity)).\n   The only case involving a traffic stop based on probable\ncause that the majority cites for its rule is Caballes. But,\nthat decision provides no support for today’s restructuring\nof our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. In Caballes, the\nCourt made clear that, in the context of a traffic stop\nsupported by probable cause, “a dog sniff would not change\nthe character of a traffic stop that is lawful at its inception\nand otherwise executed in a reasonable manner.” 543\nU. S., at 408. To be sure, the dissent in Caballes would\nhave “appl[ied] Terry’s reasonable-relation test . . . to\ndetermine whether the canine sniff impermissibly ex-\npanded the scope of the initially valid seizure of Caballes.”\nId., at 420 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting). But even it conceded\nthat the Caballes majority had “implicitly [rejected] the\napplication of Terry to a traffic stop converted, by calling\nin a dog, to a drug search.” Id., at 421.\n   By strictly limiting the tasks that define the durational\nscope of the traffic stop, the majority accomplishes today\nwhat the Caballes dissent could not: strictly limiting the\n10              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nscope of an officer’s activities during a traffic stop justified\nby probable cause. In doing so, it renders the difference\nbetween probable cause and reasonable suspicion virtually\nmeaningless in this context. That shift is supported nei-\nther by the Fourth Amendment nor by our precedents\ninterpreting it. And, it results in a constitutional frame-\nwork that lacks predictability. Had Officer Struble ar-\nrested, handcuffed, and taken Rodriguez to the police\nstation for his traffic violation, he would have complied\nwith the Fourth Amendment. See Atwater, supra, at 354–\n355. But because he made Rodriguez wait for seven or\neight extra minutes until a dog arrived, he evidently\ncommitted a constitutional violation. Such a view of the\nFourth Amendment makes little sense.\n                              III\n   Today’s revision of our Fourth Amendment jurispru-\ndence was also entirely unnecessary. Rodriguez suffered\nno Fourth Amendment violation here for an entirely inde-\npendent reason: Officer Struble had reasonable suspicion\nto continue to hold him for investigative purposes. Our\nprecedents make clear that the Fourth Amendment per-\nmits an officer to conduct an investigative traffic stop\nwhen that officer has “a particularized and objective basis\nfor suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal\nactivity.” Prado Navarette, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Reasonable suspicion\nis determined by looking at “the whole picture,” ibid.,\ntaking into account “the factual and practical considera-\ntions of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent\nmen, not legal technicians, act,” Ornelas v. United States,\n517 U. S. 690, 695 (1996) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Officer Struble testified that he first became suspicious\nthat Rodriguez was engaged in criminal activity for a\nnumber of reasons. When he approached the vehicle, he\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsmelled an “overwhelming odor of air freshener coming\nfrom the vehicle,” which is, in his experience, “a common\nattempt to conceal an odor that [people] don’t want . . . to\nbe smelled by the police.” App. 20–21. He also observed,\nupon approaching the front window on the passenger side\nof the vehicle, that Rodriguez’s passenger, Scott Pollman,\nappeared nervous. Pollman pulled his hat down low,\npuffed nervously on a cigarette, and refused to make eye\ncontact with him. The officer thought he was “more nerv-\nous than your typical passenger” who “do[esn’t] have\nanything to worry about because [t]hey didn’t commit a\n[traffic] violation.” Id., at 34.\n   Officer Struble’s interactions with the vehicle’s occu-\npants only increased his suspicions. When he asked Rod-\nriguez why he had driven onto the shoulder, Rodriguez\nclaimed that he swerved to avoid a pothole. But that story\ncould not be squared with Officer Struble’s observation of\nthe vehicle slowly driving off the road before being jerked\nback onto it. And when Officer Struble asked Pollman\nwhere they were coming from and where they were going,\nPollman told him they were traveling from Omaha, Ne-\nbraska, back to Norfolk, Nebraska, after looking at a\nvehicle they were considering purchasing. Pollman told\nthe officer that he had neither seen pictures of the vehicle\nnor confirmed title before the trip. As Officer Struble\nexplained, it “seemed suspicious” to him “to drive . . .\napproximately two hours . . . late at night to see a vehicle\nsight unseen to possibly buy it,” id., at 26, and to go from\nNorfolk to Omaha to look at it because “[u]sually people\nleave Omaha to go get vehicles, not the other way around”\ndue to higher Omaha taxes, id., at 65.\n   These facts, taken together, easily meet our standard for\nreasonable suspicion. “[N]ervous, evasive behavior is a\npertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion,”\nIllinois v. Wardlow, 528 U. S. 119, 124 (2000), and both\nvehicle occupants were engaged in such conduct. The\n12             RODRIGUEZ v.

Id., at 125. Taking into account\nall the relevant facts, Officer Struble possessed reasonable\nsuspicion of criminal activity to conduct the dog sniff.\n  Rodriguez contends that reasonable suspicion cannot\nexist because each of the actions giving rise to the officer’s\nsuspicions could be entirely innocent, but our cases easily\ndispose of that argument. Acts that, by themselves, might\nbe innocent can, when taken together, give rise to reason-\nable suspicion. United States v. Arvizu, 534 U. S. 266,\n274–275 (2002). Terry is a classic example, as it involved\ntwo individuals repeatedly walking back and forth, looking\ninto a store window, and conferring with one another as\nwell as with a third man. 392 U. S., at 6. The Court\nreasoned that this “series of acts, each of them perhaps\ninnocent in itself, . . . together warranted further investi-\ngation,” id., at 22, and it has reiterated that analysis in a\nnumber of cases, see, e.g., Arvizu, supra, at 277; United\nStates v.

The\nmajority’s holding to the contrary is irreconcilable with\nCaballes and a number of other routine police practices,\ndistorts the distinction between traffic stops justified by\nprobable cause and those justified by reasonable suspicion,\nand abandons reasonableness as the touchstone of the\nFourth Amendment.

It addresses a purely hypothetical question:\nwhether the traffic stop in this case would be unreason-\nable if the police officer, prior to leading a drug-sniffing dog\naround the exterior of petitioner’s car, did not already\nhave reasonable suspicion that the car contained drugs.\nIn fact, however, the police officer did have reasonable\nsuspicion, and, as a result, the officer was justified in\ndetaining the occupants for the short period of time (seven\nor eight minutes) that is at issue.\n   The relevant facts are not in dispute. Officer Struble,\nwho made the stop, was the only witness at the suppres-\nsion hearing, and his testimony about what happened was\nnot challenged. Defense counsel argued that the facts\nrecounted by Officer Struble were insufficient to establish\nreasonable suspicion, but defense counsel did not dispute\nthose facts or attack the officer’s credibility. Similarly, the\nMagistrate Judge who conducted the hearing did not\nquestion the officer’s credibility.          And as JUSTICE\nTHOMAS’s opinion shows, the facts recounted by Officer\nStruble “easily meet our standard for reasonable suspi-\ncion.” Ante, at 11 (dissenting opinion); see also, e.g., United\n——————\n 1 See   Brief in Opposition 11–14.\n2              RODRIGUEZ v.

Carpenter, 462 F. 3d 981, 986–987 (CA8 2006)\n(finding reasonable suspicion for a dog sniff based on\nimplausible travel plans and nervous conduct); United\nStates v. Ludwig, 641 F. 3d 1243, 1248–1250 (CA10 2011)\n(finding reasonable suspicion for a dog sniff where, among\nother things, the officer smelled “strong masking odors,”\nthe defendant’s “account of his travel was suspect,” and\nthe defendant “was exceptionally nervous throughout his\nencounter”).\n   Not only does the Court reach out to decide a question\nnot really presented by the facts in this case, but the\nCourt’s answer to that question is arbitrary. The Court\nrefuses to address the real Fourth Amendment question:\nwhether the stop was unreasonably prolonged. Instead,\nthe Court latches onto the fact that Officer Struble deliv-\nered the warning prior to the dog sniff and proclaims that\nthe authority to detain based on a traffic stop ends when a\ncitation or warning is handed over to the driver. The\nCourt thus holds that the Fourth Amendment was vio-\nlated, not because of the length of the stop, but simply be-\ncause of the sequence in which Officer Struble chose to\nperform his tasks.\n   This holding is not only arbitrary; it is perverse since\nOfficer Struble chose that sequence for the purpose of\nprotecting his own safety and possibly the safety of others.\nSee App. 71–72. Without prolonging the stop, Officer\nStruble could have conducted the dog sniff while one of the\ntasks that the Court regards as properly part of the traffic\nstop was still in progress, but that sequence would have\nentailed unnecessary risk. At approximately 12:19 a.m.,\nafter collecting Pollman’s driver’s license, Officer Struble\ndid two things. He called in the information needed to do\na records check on Pollman (a step that the Court recog-\nnizes was properly part of the traffic stop), and he re-\nquested that another officer report to the scene. Officer\nStruble had decided to perform a dog sniff but did not\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

When\noccupants of a vehicle who know that their vehicle con-\ntains a large amount of illegal drugs see that a drug-\nsniffing dog has alerted for the presence of drugs, they will\nalmost certainly realize that the police will then proceed to\nsearch the vehicle, discover the drugs, and make arrests.\nThus, it is reasonable for an officer to believe that an alert\nwill increase the risk that the occupants of the vehicle will\nattempt to flee or perhaps even attack the officer. See,\ne.g., United States v. Dawdy, 46 F. 3d 1427, 1429 (CA8\n1995) (recounting scuffle between officer and defendant\nafter drugs were discovered).\n   In this case, Officer Struble was concerned that he was\noutnumbered at the scene, and he therefore called for\nbackup and waited for the arrival of another officer before\nconducting the sniff. As a result, the sniff was not com-\npleted until seven or eight minutes after he delivered the\nwarning. But Officer Struble could have proceeded with\nthe dog sniff while he was waiting for the results of the\nrecords check on Pollman and before the arrival of the\nsecond officer. The drug-sniffing dog was present in Of-\nficer Struble’s car. If he had chosen that riskier sequence\nof events, the dog sniff would have been completed before\nthe point in time when, according to the Court’s analysis,\nthe authority to detain for the traffic stop ended. Thus, an\naction that would have been lawful had the officer made\nthe unreasonable decision to risk his life became un-\nlawful when the officer made the reasonable decision to wait\na few minutes for backup. Officer Struble’s error—\napparently—was following prudent procedures motivated\nby legitimate safety concerns. The Court’s holding there-\nfore makes no practical sense. And nothing in the Fourth\nAmendment, which speaks of reasonableness, compels this\narbitrary line.\n   The rule that the Court adopts will do little good going\n4                 RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nforward.2 It is unlikely to have any appreciable effect on\nthe length of future traffic stops. Most officers will learn\nthe prescribed sequence of events even if they cannot\nfathom the reason for that requirement. (I would love to\nbe the proverbial fly on the wall when police instructors\nteach this rule to officers who make traffic stops.)\n  For these reasons and those set out in JUSTICE\nTHOMAS’s opinion, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n    2 It\n       is important to note that the Court’s decision does not affect pro-\ncedures routinely carried out during traffic stops, including “checking\nthe driver’s license, determining whether there are outstanding war-\nrants against the driver, and inspecting the automobile’s registration\nand proof of insurance.” Ante, at 6. And the Court reaffirms that police\n“may conduct certain unrelated checks during an otherwise lawful\ntraffic stop.” Ibid. Thus, it remains true that police may ask questions\naimed at uncovering other criminal conduct and may order occupants\nout of their car during a valid stop. See Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 13–9972. Argued January 21, 2015—Decided April 21, 2015\nOfficer Struble, a K–9 officer, stopped petitioner Rodriguez for driving\n  on a highway shoulder, a violation of Nebraska law. After Struble at-\n  tended to everything relating to the stop, including, inter alia, check-\n  ing the driver’s licenses of Rodriguez and his passenger and issuing a\n  warning for the traffic offense, he asked Rodriguez for permission to\n  walk his dog around the vehicle. When Rodriguez refused, Struble\n  detained him until a second officer arrived. Struble then retrieved\n  his dog, who alerted to the presence of drugs in the vehicle. The en-\n  suing search revealed methamphetamine. Seven or eight minutes\n  elapsed from the time Struble issued the written warning until the\n  dog alerted.\n     Rodriguez was indicted on federal drug charges. He moved to sup-\n  press the evidence seized from the vehicle on the ground, among oth-\n  ers, that Struble had prolonged the traffic stop without reasonable\n  suspicion in order to conduct the dog sniff. The Magistrate Judge\n  recommended denial of the motion. He found no reasonable suspicion\n  supporting detention once Struble issued the written warning. Un-\n  der Eighth Circuit precedent, however, he concluded that prolonging\n  the stop by “seven to eight minutes” for the dog sniff was only a de\n  minimis intrusion on Rodriguez’s Fourth Amendment rights and was\n  for that reason permissible. The District Court then denied the mo-\n  tion to suppress. Rodriguez entered a conditional guilty plea and was\n  sentenced to five years in prison. The Eighth Circuit affirmed. Not-\n  ing that the seven or eight minute delay was an acceptable “de mini-\n  mis intrusion on Rodriguez’s personal liberty,” the court declined to\n  reach the question whether Struble had reasonable suspicion to con-\n  tinue Rodriguez’s detention after issuing the written warning.\nHeld:\n2                    RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n         1. Absent reasonable suspicion, police extension of a traffic stop\n    in order to conduct a dog sniff violates the Constitution’s shield\n    against unreasonable seizures.\n       A routine traffic stop is more like a brief stop under Terry v. Ohio,\n    392 U. S. 1, than an arrest, see, e.g., Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U. S.\n    323, 330. Its tolerable duration is determined by the seizure’s “mis-\n    sion,” which is to address the traffic violation that warranted the\n    stop, Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407 and attend to related\n    safety concerns. Authority for the seizure ends when tasks tied to\n    the traffic infraction are—or reasonably should have been—\n    completed. The Fourth Amendment may tolerate certain unrelated\n    investigations that do not lengthen the roadside detention, Johnson,\n    555 U. S., at 327–328 (questioning); Caballes, 543 U. S., at 406, 408\n    (dog sniff), but a traffic stop “become[s] unlawful if it is prolonged be-\n    yond the time reasonably required to complete th[e] mission” of issu-\n    ing a warning ticket, id., at 407.\n       Beyond determining whether to issue a traffic ticket, an officer’s\n    mission during a traffic stop typically includes checking the driver’s\n    license, determining whether there are outstanding warrants against\n    the driver, and inspecting the automobile’s registration and proof of\n    insurance. These checks serve the same objective as enforcement of\n    the traffic code: ensuring that vehicles on the road are operated safe-\n    ly and responsibly. See Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 658–659.\n    Lacking the same close connection to roadway safety as the ordinary\n    inquiries, a dog sniff is not fairly characterized as part of the officer’s\n    traffic mission.\n       In concluding that the de minimis intrusion here could be offset by\n    the Government’s interest in stopping the flow of illegal drugs, the\n    Eighth Circuit relied on Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106. The\n    Court reasoned in Mimms that the government’s “legitimate and\n    weighty” interest in officer safety outweighed the “de minimis” addi-\n    tional intrusion of requiring a driver, lawfully stopped, to exit a vehi-\n    cle, id., at 110–111. The officer-safety interest recognized in Mimms,\n    however, stemmed from the danger to the officer associated with the\n    traffic stop itself. On-scene investigation into other crimes, in con-\n    trast, detours from the officer’s traffic-control mission and therefore\n    gains no support from Mimms.\n       The Government’s argument that an officer who completes all traf-\n    fic-related tasks expeditiously should earn extra time to pursue an\n    unrelated criminal investigation is unpersuasive, for a traffic stop\n    “prolonged beyond” the time in fact needed for the officer to complete\n    his traffic-based inquiries is “unlawful,” Caballes, 543 U. S., at 407.\n    The critical question is not whether the dog sniff occurs before or af-\n    ter the officer issues a ticket, but whether conducting the sniff adds\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

Caballes, 543 U. S. 405 (2005), this Court\nheld that a dog sniff conducted during a lawful traffic stop\ndoes not violate the Fourth Amendment’s proscription of\nunreasonable seizures. This case presents the question\nwhether the Fourth Amendment tolerates a dog sniff\nconducted after completion of a traffic stop. We hold that\na police stop exceeding the time needed to handle the\nmatter for which the stop was made violates the Constitu­\ntion’s shield against unreasonable seizures. A seizure\njustified only by a police-observed traffic violation, there­\nfore, “become[s] unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time\nreasonably required to complete th[e] mission” of issuing a\nticket for the violation. Id., at 407. The Court so recog­\nnized in Caballes, and we adhere to the line drawn in that\ndecision.\n                            I\n  Just after midnight on March 27, 2012, police officer\nMorgan Struble observed a Mercury Mountaineer veer\nslowly onto the shoulder of Nebraska State Highway 275\nfor one or two seconds and then jerk back onto the road.\n2               RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nNebraska law prohibits driving on highway shoulders, see\nNeb. Rev. Stat. §60–6,142 (2010), and on that basis, Stru­\nble pulled the Mountaineer over at 12:06 a.m. Struble is a\nK–9 officer with the Valley Police Department in Ne­\nbraska, and his dog Floyd was in his patrol car that night.\nTwo men were in the Mountaineer: the driver, Dennys\nRodriguez, and a front-seat passenger, Scott Pollman.\n   Struble approached the Mountaineer on the passenger’s\nside. After Rodriguez identified himself, Struble asked\nhim why he had driven onto the shoulder. Rodriguez\nreplied that he had swerved to avoid a pothole. Struble\nthen gathered Rodriguez’s license, registration, and proof\nof insurance, and asked Rodriguez to accompany him to\nthe patrol car. Rodriguez asked if he was required to do\nso, and Struble answered that he was not. Rodriguez\ndecided to wait in his own vehicle.\n   After running a records check on Rodriguez, Struble\nreturned to the Mountaineer. Struble asked passenger\nPollman for his driver’s license and began to question him\nabout where the two men were coming from and where\nthey were going. Pollman replied that they had traveled\nto Omaha, Nebraska, to look at a Ford Mustang that was\nfor sale and that they were returning to Norfolk, Ne­\nbraska. Struble returned again to his patrol car, where he\ncompleted a records check on Pollman, and called for a\nsecond officer. Struble then began writing a warning\nticket for Rodriguez for driving on the shoulder of the\nroad.\n   Struble returned to Rodriguez’s vehicle a third time to\nissue the written warning. By 12:27 or 12:28 a.m., Struble\nhad finished explaining the warning to Rodriguez, and\nhad given back to Rodriguez and Pollman the documents\nobtained from them. As Struble later testified, at that\npoint, Rodriguez and Pollman “had all their documents\nback and a copy of the written warning. I got all the\nreason[s] for the stop out of the way[,] . . . took care of all\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe business.” App. 70.\n  Nevertheless, Struble did not consider Rodriguez “free\nto leave.” Id., at 69–70. Although justification for the\ntraffic stop was “out of the way,” id., at 70, Struble asked\nfor permission to walk his dog around Rodriguez’s vehicle.\nRodriguez said no. Struble then instructed Rodriguez to\nturn off the ignition, exit the vehicle, and stand in front of\nthe patrol car to wait for the second officer. Rodriguez\ncomplied. At 12:33 a.m., a deputy sheriff arrived. Struble\nretrieved his dog and led him twice around the Moun­\ntaineer. The dog alerted to the presence of drugs halfway\nthrough Struble’s second pass. All told, seven or eight\nminutes had elapsed from the time Struble issued the\nwritten warning until the dog indicated the presence of\ndrugs. A search of the vehicle revealed a large bag of\nmethamphetamine.\n  Rodriguez was indicted in the United States District\nCourt for the District of Nebraska on one count of posses­\nsion with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth­\namphetamine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. §§841(a)(1) and\n(b)(1). He moved to suppress the evidence seized from his\ncar on the ground, among others, that Struble had pro­\nlonged the traffic stop without reasonable suspicion in\norder to conduct the dog sniff.\n  After receiving evidence, a Magistrate Judge recom­\nmended that the motion be denied. The Magistrate Judge\nfound no probable cause to search the vehicle independent\nof the dog alert. App. 100 (apart from “information given\nby the dog,” “Officer Struble had [no]thing other than a\nrather large hunch”). He further found that no reasonable\nsuspicion supported the detention once Struble issued the\nwritten warning. He concluded, however, that under\nEighth Circuit precedent, extension of the stop by “seven\nto eight minutes” for the dog sniff was only a de minimis\nintrusion on Rodriguez’s Fourth Amendment rights and\nwas therefore permissible.\n4              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s\nfactual findings and legal conclusions and denied Rodri­\nguez’s motion to suppress. The court noted that, in the\nEighth Circuit, “dog sniffs that occur within a short time\nfollowing the completion of a traffic stop are not constitu­\ntionally prohibited if they constitute only de minimis\nintrusions.” App. 114 (quoting United States v. Alexander,\n448 F. 3d 1014, 1016 (CA8 2006)). The court thus agreed\nwith the Magistrate Judge that the “7 to 10 minutes”\nadded to the stop by the dog sniff “was not of constitu­\ntional significance.” App. 114. Impelled by that decision,\nRodriguez entered a conditional guilty plea and was sen­\ntenced to five years in prison.\n   The Eighth Circuit affirmed. The “seven- or eight-\nminute delay” in this case, the opinion noted, resembled\ndelays that the court had previously ranked as permissi­\nble. 741 F. 3d 905, 907 (2014). The Court of Appeals thus\nruled that the delay here constituted an acceptable “de\nminimis intrusion on Rodriguez’s personal liberty.” Id., at\n908. Given that ruling, the court declined to reach the\nquestion whether Struble had reasonable suspicion to\ncontinue Rodriguez’s detention after issuing the written\nwarning.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a division among lower\ncourts on the question whether police routinely may ex­\ntend an otherwise-completed traffic stop, absent reason­\nable suspicion, in order to conduct a dog sniff. 573 U. S. ___\n(2014). Compare, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 270 F. 3d\n625, 632 (CA8 2001) (postcompletion delay of “well under\nten minutes” permissible), with, e.g., State v. Baker, 2010\nUT 18, ¶13, 229 P. 3d 650, 658 (2010) (“[W]ithout addi­\ntional reasonable suspicion, the officer must allow the\nseized person to depart once the purpose of the stop has\nconcluded.”).\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

Iowa, 525\nU. S. 113, 117 (1998) (quoting Berkemer v. McCarty, 468\nU. S. 420, 439 (1984), in turn citing Terry v. Ohio, 392\nU. S. 1 (1968)). See also Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U. S.\n323, 330 (2009). Like a Terry stop, the tolerable duration\nof police inquiries in the traffic-stop context is determined\nby the seizure’s “mission”—to address the traffic violation\nthat warranted the stop, Caballes, 543 U. S., at 407, and\nattend to related safety concerns, infra, at 6–7. See also\nUnited States v. Sharpe, 470 U. S. 675, 685 (1985); Florida\nv. Royer, 460 U. S. 491, 500 (1983) (plurality opinion)\n(“The scope of the detention must be carefully tailored to\nits underlying justification.”). Because addressing the\ninfraction is the purpose of the stop, it may “last no longer\nthan is necessary to effectuate th[at] purpose.” Ibid. See\nalso Caballes, 543 U. S., at 407. Authority for the seizure\nthus ends when tasks tied to the traffic infraction are—or\nreasonably should have been—completed. See Sharpe,\n470 U. S., at 686 (in determining the reasonable duration\nof a stop, “it [is] appropriate to examine whether the police\ndiligently pursued [the] investigation”).\n   Our decisions in Caballes and Johnson heed these con­\nstraints. In both cases, we concluded that the Fourth\nAmendment tolerated certain unrelated investigations\nthat did not lengthen the roadside detention. Johnson,\n555 U. S., at 327–328 (questioning); Caballes, 543 U. S., at\n406, 408 (dog sniff). In Caballes, however, we cautioned\nthat a traffic stop “can become unlawful if it is prolonged\nbeyond the time reasonably required to complete th[e]\nmission” of issuing a warning ticket. 543 U. S., at 407.\nAnd we repeated that admonition in Johnson: The seizure\nremains lawful only “so long as [unrelated] inquiries do\n6              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot measurably extend the duration of the stop.” 555\nU. S., at 333. See also Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 101\n(2005) (because unrelated inquiries did not “exten[d] the\ntime [petitioner] was detained[,] . . . no additional Fourth\nAmendment justification . . . was required”). An officer, in\nother words, may conduct certain unrelated checks during\nan otherwise lawful traffic stop. But contrary to JUSTICE\nALITO’s suggestion, post, at 4, n. 2, he may not do so in a\nway that prolongs the stop, absent the reasonable suspi­\ncion ordinarily demanded to justify detaining an individ­\nual. But see post, at 1–2 (ALITO, J., dissenting) (premising\nopinion on the dissent’s own finding of “reasonable suspi­\ncion,” although the District Court reached the opposite\nconclusion, and the Court of Appeals declined to consider\nthe issue).\n  Beyond determining whether to issue a traffic ticket, an\nofficer’s mission includes “ordinary inquiries incident to\n[the traffic] stop.” Caballes, 543 U. S., at 408. Typically\nsuch inquiries involve checking the driver’s license, de­\ntermining whether there are outstanding warrants\nagainst the driver, and inspecting the automobile’s regis­\ntration and proof of insurance. See Delaware v. Prouse,\n440 U. S. 648, 658–660 (1979). See also 4 W. LaFave,\nSearch and Seizure §9.3(c), pp. 507–517 (5th ed. 2012).\nThese checks serve the same objective as enforcement of\nthe traffic code: ensuring that vehicles on the road are\noperated safely and responsibly. See Prouse, 440 U. S., at\n658–659; LaFave, Search and Seizure §9.3(c), at 516 (A\n“warrant check makes it possible to determine whether\nthe apparent traffic violator is wanted for one or more\nprevious traffic offenses.”).\n   A dog sniff, by contrast, is a measure aimed at “de­\ntect[ing] evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing.”\nIndianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, 40–41 (2000). See\nalso Florida v. Jardines, 569 U. S. 1, ___–___ (2013) (slip\nop., at 7–8). Candidly, the Government acknowledged at\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. Lacking the same\nclose connection to roadway safety as the ordinary inquir­\nies, a dog sniff is not fairly characterized as part of the\nofficer’s traffic mission.\n   In advancing its de minimis rule, the Eighth Circuit\nrelied heavily on our decision in Pennsylvania v. Mimms,\n434 U. S. 106 (1977) (per curiam). See United States v.\n$404,905.00 in U. S. Currency, 182 F. 3d 643, 649 (CA8\n1999). In Mimms, we reasoned that the government’s\n“legitimate and weighty” interest in officer safety out­\nweighs the “de minimis” additional intrusion of requiring\na driver, already lawfully stopped, to exit the vehicle. 434\nU. S., at 110–111. See also Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S.\n408, 413–415 (1997) (passengers may be required to exit\nvehicle stopped for traffic violation). The Eighth Circuit,\nechoed in JUSTICE THOMAS’s dissent, believed that the\nimposition here similarly could be offset by the Govern­\nment’s “strong interest in interdicting the flow of illegal\ndrugs along the nation’s highways.” $404,905.00 in U. S.\nCurrency, 182 F. 3d, at 649; see post, at 9.\n   Unlike a general interest in criminal enforcement,\nhowever, the government’s officer safety interest stems\nfrom the mission of the stop itself. Traffic stops are “espe­\ncially fraught with danger to police officers,” Johnson, 555\nU. S., at 330 (internal quotation marks omitted), so an\nofficer may need to take certain negligibly burdensome\nprecautions in order to complete his mission safely. Cf.\nUnited States v. Holt, 264 F. 3d 1215, 1221–1222 (CA10\n2001) (en banc) (recognizing officer safety justification for\ncriminal record and outstanding warrant checks), abro­\ngated on other grounds as recognized in United States v.\nStewart, 473 F. 3d 1265, 1269 (CA10 2007). On-scene\ninvestigation into other crimes, however, detours from\nthat mission. See supra, at 6–7. So too do safety precau­\n8              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntions taken in order to facilitate such detours. But cf. post,\nat 2–3 (ALITO, J., dissenting). Thus, even assuming that\nthe imposition here was no more intrusive than the exit\norder in Mimms, the dog sniff could not be justified on the\nsame basis. Highway and officer safety are interests\ndifferent in kind from the Government’s endeavor to de­\ntect crime in general or drug trafficking in particular.\n   The Government argues that an officer may “incremen­\ntal[ly]” prolong a stop to conduct a dog sniff so long as the\nofficer is reasonably diligent in pursuing the traffic-related\npurpose of the stop, and the overall duration of the stop\nremains reasonable in relation to the duration of other\ntraffic stops involving similar circumstances. Brief for\nUnited States 36–39. The Government’s argument, in\neffect, is that by completing all traffic-related tasks expe­\nditiously, an officer can earn bonus time to pursue an\nunrelated criminal investigation. See also post, at 2–5\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (embracing the Government’s\nargument). The reasonableness of a seizure, however,\ndepends on what the police in fact do. See Knowles, 525\nU. S., at 115–117.       In this regard, the Government\nacknowledges that “an officer always has to be reasonably\ndiligent.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 49. How could diligence be\ngauged other than by noting what the officer actually did\nand how he did it? If an officer can complete traffic-based\ninquiries expeditiously, then that is the amount of “time\nreasonably required to complete [the stop’s] mission.”\nCaballes, 543 U. S., at 407. As we said in Caballes and\nreiterate today, a traffic stop “prolonged beyond” that\npoint is “unlawful.” Ibid. The critical question, then, is\nnot whether the dog sniff occurs before or after the officer\nissues a ticket, as JUSTICE ALITO supposes, post, at 2–4,\nbut whether conducting the sniff “prolongs”—i.e., adds\ntime to—“the stop,” supra, at 6.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 408\n(2005). The only question here is whether an officer exe-\ncuted a stop in a reasonable manner when he waited to\nconduct a dog sniff until after he had given the driver a\nwritten warning and a backup unit had arrived, bringing\nthe overall duration of the stop to 29 minutes. Because\nthe stop was reasonably executed, no Fourth Amendment\nviolation occurred. The Court’s holding to the contrary\ncannot be reconciled with our decision in Caballes or a\nnumber of common police practices. It was also unneces-\nsary, as the officer possessed reasonable suspicion to\ncontinue to hold the driver to conduct the dog sniff. I\nrespectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  The Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the\npeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.”\nU. S. Const., Amdt. 4. As the text indicates, and as we\n2              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nhave repeatedly confirmed, “the ultimate touchstone of the\nFourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness.’ ” Brigham City v.\nStuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006). We have defined rea-\nsonableness “in objective terms by examining the totality\nof the circumstances,” Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 39\n(1996), and by considering “the traditional protections\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures afforded by\nthe common law at the time of the framing,” Atwater v.\nLago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 326 (2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). When traditional protections have not\nprovided a definitive answer, our precedents have “ana-\nlyzed a search or seizure in light of traditional standards\nof reasonableness by assessing, on the one hand, the de-\ngree to which it intrudes upon an individual’s privacy and,\non the other, the degree to which it is needed for the pro-\nmotion of legitimate governmental interests.” Virginia v.\nMoore, 553 U. S. 164, 171 (2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Although a traffic stop “constitutes a ‘seizure’ of ‘per-\nsons’ within the meaning of [the Fourth Amendment],”\nsuch a seizure is constitutionally “reasonable where the\npolice have probable cause to believe that a traffic viola-\ntion has occurred.” Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806,\n809–810 (1996). But “a seizure that is lawful at its incep-\ntion can violate the Fourth Amendment if its manner of\nexecution unreasonably infringes interests protected by\nthe Constitution.” Caballes, supra, at 407.\n   Because Rodriguez does not dispute that Officer Struble\nhad probable cause to stop him, the only question is\nwhether the stop was otherwise executed in a reasonable\nmanner. See Brief for Appellant in No. 13–1176 (CA8),\np. 4, n. 2. I easily conclude that it was. Approximately 29\nminutes passed from the time Officer Struble stopped\nRodriguez until his narcotics-detection dog alerted to the\npresence of drugs. That amount of time is hardly out of\nthe ordinary for a traffic stop by a single officer of a vehi-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncle containing multiple occupants even when no dog sniff\nis involved. See, e.g., United States v. Ellis, 497 F. 3d 606\n(CA6 2007) (22 minutes); United States v. Barragan, 379\nF. 3d 524 (CA8 2004) (approximately 30 minutes). During\nthat time, Officer Struble conducted the ordinary activities\nof a traffic stop—he approached the vehicle, questioned\nRodriguez about the observed violation, asked Pollman\nabout their travel plans, ran serial warrant checks on\nRodriguez and Pollman, and issued a written warning to\nRodriguez. And when he decided to conduct a dog sniff, he\ntook the precaution of calling for backup out of concern for\nhis safety. See 741 F. 3d 905, 907 (CA8 2014); see also\nPennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 110 (1977) (per\ncuriam) (officer safety is a “legitimate and weighty” con-\ncern relevant to reasonableness).\n   As Caballes makes clear, the fact that Officer Struble\nwaited until after he gave Rodriguez the warning to con-\nduct the dog sniff does not alter this analysis. Because\n“the use of a well-trained narcotics-detection dog . . . gen-\nerally does not implicate legitimate privacy interests,” 543\nU. S., at 409, “conducting a dog sniff would not change the\ncharacter of a traffic stop that is lawful at its inception\nand otherwise executed in a reasonable manner,” id., at\n408. The stop here was “lawful at its inception and other-\nwise executed in a reasonable manner.” Ibid. As in Ca-\nballes, “conducting a dog sniff [did] not change the charac-\nter of [the] traffic stop,” ibid., and thus no Fourth\nAmendment violation occurred.\n                             II\n  Rather than adhere to the reasonableness requirement\nthat we have repeatedly characterized as the “touchstone\nof the Fourth Amendment,” Brigham City, supra, at 403,\nthe majority constructed a test of its own that is incon-\nsistent with our precedents.\n4              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\n                               A\n\n   The majority’s rule requires a traffic stop to “en[d] when\ntasks tied to the traffic infraction are—or reasonably\nshould have been—completed.” Ante, at 5. “If an officer\ncan complete traffic-based inquiries expeditiously, then\nthat is the amount of time reasonably required to complete\nthe stop’s mission” and he may hold the individual no\nlonger. Ante, at 8 (internal quotation marks and altera-\ntions omitted). The majority’s rule thus imposes a one-\nway ratchet for constitutional protection linked to the\ncharacteristics of the individual officer conducting the\nstop: If a driver is stopped by a particularly efficient of-\nficer, then he will be entitled to be released from the traf-\nfic stop after a shorter period of time than a driver stopped\nby a less efficient officer. Similarly, if a driver is stopped\nby an officer with access to technology that can shorten a\nrecords check, then he will be entitled to be released from\nthe stop after a shorter period of time than an individual\nstopped by an officer without access to such technology.\n   I “cannot accept that the search and seizure protections\nof the Fourth Amendment are so variable and can be made\nto turn upon such trivialities.” Whren, 517 U. S., at 815\n(citations omitted). We have repeatedly explained that the\nreasonableness inquiry must not hinge on the characteris-\ntics of the individual officer conducting the seizure. We\nhave held, for example, that an officer’s state of mind\n“does not invalidate [an] action taken as long as the cir-\ncumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action.” Id., at\n813 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have spurned\ntheories that would make the Fourth Amendment “change\nwith local law enforcement practices.” Moore, supra, at\n172. And we have rejected a rule that would require the\noffense establishing probable cause to be “closely related\nto” the offense identified by the arresting officer, as such a\nrule would make “the constitutionality of an arrest . . .\nvary from place to place and from time to time, depending\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\non whether the arresting officer states the reason for the\ndetention and, if so, whether he correctly identifies a\ngeneral class of offense for which probable cause exists.”\nDevenpeck v. Alford, 543 U. S. 146, 154 (2004) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). In Devenpeck, a\nunanimous Court explained: “An arrest made by a knowl-\nedgeable, veteran officer would be valid, whereas an arrest\nmade by a rookie in precisely the same circumstances\nwould not. We see no reason to ascribe to the Fourth\nAmendment such arbitrarily variable protection.” Ibid.\n  The majority’s logic would produce similarly arbitrary\nresults. Under its reasoning, a traffic stop made by a\nrookie could be executed in a reasonable manner, whereas\nthe same traffic stop made by a knowledgeable, veteran\nofficer in precisely the same circumstances might not, if in\nfact his knowledge and experience made him capable of\ncompleting the stop faster. We have long rejected inter-\npretations of the Fourth Amendment that would produce\nsuch haphazard results, and I see no reason to depart from\nour consistent practice today.\n                              B\n   As if that were not enough, the majority also limits the\nduration of the stop to the time it takes the officer to\ncomplete a narrow category of “traffic-based inquiries.”\nAnte, at 8. According to the majority, these inquiries\ninclude those that “serve the same objective as enforce-\nment of the traffic code: ensuring that vehicles on the road\nare operated safely and responsibly.” Ante, at 6. Inquiries\ndirected to “detecting evidence of ordinary criminal\nwrongdoing” are not traffic-related inquiries and thus\ncannot count toward the overall duration of the stop. Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).\n   The combination of that definition of traffic-related\ninquiries with the majority’s officer-specific durational\nlimit produces a result demonstrably at odds with our\n6               RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndecision in Caballes. Caballes expressly anticipated that a\ntraffic stop could be reasonably prolonged for officers to\nengage in a dog sniff. We explained that no Fourth\nAmendment violation had occurred in Caballes, where the\n“duration of the stop . . . was entirely justified by the\ntraffic offense and the ordinary inquiries incident to such\na stop,” but suggested a different result might attend a\ncase “involving a dog sniff that occurred during an unrea-\nsonably prolonged traffic stop.” 543 U. S., at 407–408\n(emphasis added). The dividing line was whether the\noverall duration of the stop exceeded “the time reasonably\nrequired to complete th[e] mission,” id., at 407, not, as the\nmajority suggests, whether the duration of the stop “in\nfact” exceeded the time necessary to complete the traffic-\nrelated inquiries, ante, at 8.\n   The majority’s approach draws an artificial line between\ndog sniffs and other common police practices. The lower\ncourts have routinely confirmed that warrant checks are a\nconstitutionally permissible part of a traffic stop, see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Simmons, 172 F. 3d 775, 778 (CA11\n1999); United States v. Mendez, 118 F. 3d 1426, 1429\n(CA10 1997); United States v. Shabazz, 993 F. 2d 431, 437\n(CA5 1993), and the majority confirms that it finds no\nfault in these measures, ante, at 6. Yet its reasoning\nsuggests the opposite. Such warrant checks look more like\nthey are directed to “detecting evidence of ordinary crimi-\nnal wrongdoing” than to “ensuring that vehicles on the\nroad are operated safely and responsibly.” Ante, at 6\n(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Per-\nhaps one could argue that the existence of an outstanding\nwarrant might make a driver less likely to operate his\nvehicle safely and responsibly on the road, but the same\ncould be said about a driver in possession of contraband.\nA driver confronted by the police in either case might try\nto flee or become violent toward the officer. But under the\nmajority’s analysis, a dog sniff, which is directed at uncov-\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             7\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nering that problem, is not treated as a traffic-based in-\nquiry. Warrant checks, arguably, should fare no better.\nThe majority suggests that a warrant check is an ordinary\ninquiry incident to a traffic stop because it can be used “ ‘to\ndetermine whether the apparent traffic violator is wanted\nfor one or more previous traffic offenses.’ ” Ante, at 6\n(quoting 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §9.3(c), p. 516\n(5th ed. 2012)). But as the very treatise on which the\nmajority relies notes, such checks are a “manifest[ation of]\nthe ‘war on drugs’ motivation so often underlying [routine\ntraffic] stops,” and thus are very much like the dog sniff in\nthis case. Id., §9.3(c), at 507–508.\n   Investigative questioning rests on the same basis as the\ndog sniff. “Asking questions is an essential part of police\ninvestigations.” Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of\nNev., Humboldt Cty., 542 U. S. 177, 185 (2004). And the\nlower courts have routinely upheld such questioning dur-\ning routine traffic stops. See, e.g., United States v. Rivera,\n570 F. 3d 1009, 1013 (CA8 2009); United States v. Childs,\n277 F. 3d 947, 953–954 (CA7 2002). The majority’s rea-\nsoning appears to allow officers to engage in some ques-\ntioning aimed at detecting evidence of ordinary criminal\nwrongdoing. Ante, at 5. But it is hard to see how such\ninquiries fall within the “seizure’s ‘mission’ [of ] ad-\ndress[ing] the traffic violation that warranted the stop,” or\n“attend[ing] to related safety concerns.” Ibid. Its reason-\ning appears to come down to the principle that dogs are\ndifferent.\n                             C\n   On a more fundamental level, the majority’s inquiry\nelides the distinction between traffic stops based on prob-\nable cause and those based on reasonable suspicion.\nProbable cause is the “traditional justification” for the\nseizure of a person. Whren, 517 U. S., at 817 (emphasis\ndeleted); see also Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200,\n8               RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n207–208 (1979). This Court created an exception to that\nrule in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), permitting “police\nofficers who suspect criminal activity to make limited\nintrusions on an individual’s personal security based on\nless than probable cause,” Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S.\n692, 698 (1981). Reasonable suspicion is the justification\nfor such seizures. Prado Navarette v. California, 572 U. S.\n___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 3).\n   Traffic stops can be initiated based on probable cause or\nreasonable suspicion. Although the Court has commented\nthat a routine traffic stop is “more analogous to a so-called\n‘Terry stop’ than to a formal arrest,” it has rejected the\nnotion “that a traffic stop supported by probable cause\nmay not exceed the bounds set by the Fourth Amendment\non the scope of a Terry stop.” Berkemer v. McCarty, 468\nU. S. 420, 439, and n. 29 (1984) (citation omitted).\n   Although all traffic stops must be executed reasonably,\nour precedents make clear that traffic stops justified by\nreasonable suspicion are subject to additional limitations\nthat those justified by probable cause are not. A traffic\nstop based on reasonable suspicion, like all Terry stops,\nmust be “justified at its inception” and “reasonably related\nin scope to the circumstances which justified the interfer-\nence in the first place.” Hiibel, 542 U. S., at 185 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). It also “cannot continue for an\nexcessive period of time or resemble a traditional arrest.”\nId., at 185–186 (citation omitted). By contrast, a stop\nbased on probable cause affords an officer considerably\nmore leeway. In such seizures, an officer may engage in a\nwarrantless arrest of the driver, Atwater, 532 U. S., at\n354, a warrantless search incident to arrest of the driver,\nRiley v. California, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 5),\nand a warrantless search incident to arrest of the vehicle\nif it is reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime\nof arrest might be found there, Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S.\n332, 335 (2009).\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             9\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   The majority casually tosses this distinction aside. It\nasserts that the traffic stop in this case, which was undis-\nputedly initiated on the basis of probable cause, can last\nno longer than is in fact necessary to effectuate the mis-\nsion of the stop. Ante, at 8. And, it assumes that the\nmission of the stop was merely to write a traffic ticket,\nrather than to consider making a custodial arrest. Ante,\nat 5. In support of that durational requirement, it relies\nprimarily on cases involving Terry stops. See ante, at 5–7\n(citing Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U. S. 323 (2009) (analyzing\n“stop and frisk” of passenger in a vehicle temporarily\nseized for a traffic violation); United States v. Sharpe, 470\nU. S. 675 (1985) (analyzing seizure of individuals based on\nsuspicion of marijuana trafficking); Florida v. Royer, 460\nU. S. 491 (1983) (plurality opinion) (analyzing seizure of\nman walking through airport on suspicion of narcotics\nactivity)).\n   The only case involving a traffic stop based on probable\ncause that the majority cites for its rule is Caballes. But,\nthat decision provides no support for today’s restructuring\nof our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. In Caballes, the\nCourt made clear that, in the context of a traffic stop\nsupported by probable cause, “a dog sniff would not change\nthe character of a traffic stop that is lawful at its inception\nand otherwise executed in a reasonable manner.” 543\nU. S., at 408. To be sure, the dissent in Caballes would\nhave “appl[ied] Terry’s reasonable-relation test . . . to\ndetermine whether the canine sniff impermissibly ex-\npanded the scope of the initially valid seizure of Caballes.”\nId., at 420 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting). But even it conceded\nthat the Caballes majority had “implicitly [rejected] the\napplication of Terry to a traffic stop converted, by calling\nin a dog, to a drug search.” Id., at 421.\n   By strictly limiting the tasks that define the durational\nscope of the traffic stop, the majority accomplishes today\nwhat the Caballes dissent could not: strictly limiting the\n10              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nscope of an officer’s activities during a traffic stop justified\nby probable cause. In doing so, it renders the difference\nbetween probable cause and reasonable suspicion virtually\nmeaningless in this context. That shift is supported nei-\nther by the Fourth Amendment nor by our precedents\ninterpreting it. And, it results in a constitutional frame-\nwork that lacks predictability. Had Officer Struble ar-\nrested, handcuffed, and taken Rodriguez to the police\nstation for his traffic violation, he would have complied\nwith the Fourth Amendment. See Atwater, supra, at 354–\n355. But because he made Rodriguez wait for seven or\neight extra minutes until a dog arrived, he evidently\ncommitted a constitutional violation. Such a view of the\nFourth Amendment makes little sense.\n                              III\n   Today’s revision of our Fourth Amendment jurispru-\ndence was also entirely unnecessary. Rodriguez suffered\nno Fourth Amendment violation here for an entirely inde-\npendent reason: Officer Struble had reasonable suspicion\nto continue to hold him for investigative purposes. Our\nprecedents make clear that the Fourth Amendment per-\nmits an officer to conduct an investigative traffic stop\nwhen that officer has “a particularized and objective basis\nfor suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal\nactivity.” Prado Navarette, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Reasonable suspicion\nis determined by looking at “the whole picture,” ibid.,\ntaking into account “the factual and practical considera-\ntions of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent\nmen, not legal technicians, act,” Ornelas v. United States,\n517 U. S. 690, 695 (1996) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Officer Struble testified that he first became suspicious\nthat Rodriguez was engaged in criminal activity for a\nnumber of reasons. When he approached the vehicle, he\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsmelled an “overwhelming odor of air freshener coming\nfrom the vehicle,” which is, in his experience, “a common\nattempt to conceal an odor that [people] don’t want . . . to\nbe smelled by the police.” App. 20–21. He also observed,\nupon approaching the front window on the passenger side\nof the vehicle, that Rodriguez’s passenger, Scott Pollman,\nappeared nervous. Pollman pulled his hat down low,\npuffed nervously on a cigarette, and refused to make eye\ncontact with him. The officer thought he was “more nerv-\nous than your typical passenger” who “do[esn’t] have\nanything to worry about because [t]hey didn’t commit a\n[traffic] violation.” Id., at 34.\n   Officer Struble’s interactions with the vehicle’s occu-\npants only increased his suspicions. When he asked Rod-\nriguez why he had driven onto the shoulder, Rodriguez\nclaimed that he swerved to avoid a pothole. But that story\ncould not be squared with Officer Struble’s observation of\nthe vehicle slowly driving off the road before being jerked\nback onto it. And when Officer Struble asked Pollman\nwhere they were coming from and where they were going,\nPollman told him they were traveling from Omaha, Ne-\nbraska, back to Norfolk, Nebraska, after looking at a\nvehicle they were considering purchasing. Pollman told\nthe officer that he had neither seen pictures of the vehicle\nnor confirmed title before the trip. As Officer Struble\nexplained, it “seemed suspicious” to him “to drive . . .\napproximately two hours . . . late at night to see a vehicle\nsight unseen to possibly buy it,” id., at 26, and to go from\nNorfolk to Omaha to look at it because “[u]sually people\nleave Omaha to go get vehicles, not the other way around”\ndue to higher Omaha taxes, id., at 65.\n   These facts, taken together, easily meet our standard for\nreasonable suspicion. “[N]ervous, evasive behavior is a\npertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion,”\nIllinois v. Wardlow, 528 U. S. 119, 124 (2000), and both\nvehicle occupants were engaged in such conduct. The\n12             RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nofficer also recognized heavy use of air freshener, which, in\nhis experience, indicated the presence of contraband in the\nvehicle. “[C]ommonsense judgments and inferences about\nhuman behavior” further support the officer’s conclusion\nthat Pollman’s story about their trip was likely a cover\nstory for illegal activity. Id., at 125. Taking into account\nall the relevant facts, Officer Struble possessed reasonable\nsuspicion of criminal activity to conduct the dog sniff.\n  Rodriguez contends that reasonable suspicion cannot\nexist because each of the actions giving rise to the officer’s\nsuspicions could be entirely innocent, but our cases easily\ndispose of that argument. Acts that, by themselves, might\nbe innocent can, when taken together, give rise to reason-\nable suspicion. United States v. Arvizu, 534 U. S. 266,\n274–275 (2002). Terry is a classic example, as it involved\ntwo individuals repeatedly walking back and forth, looking\ninto a store window, and conferring with one another as\nwell as with a third man. 392 U. S., at 6. The Court\nreasoned that this “series of acts, each of them perhaps\ninnocent in itself, . . . together warranted further investi-\ngation,” id., at 22, and it has reiterated that analysis in a\nnumber of cases, see, e.g., Arvizu, supra, at 277; United\nStates v. Sokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 9–10 (1989). This one is no\ndifferent.\n                        *    *     *\n  I would conclude that the police did not violate the\nFourth Amendment here. Officer Struble possessed prob-\nable cause to stop Rodriguez for driving on the shoulder,\nand he executed the subsequent stop in a reasonable\nmanner. Our decision in Caballes requires no more. The\nmajority’s holding to the contrary is irreconcilable with\nCaballes and a number of other routine police practices,\ndistorts the distinction between traffic stops justified by\nprobable cause and those justified by reasonable suspicion,\nand abandons reasonableness as the touchstone of the\nFourth Amendment.

It addresses a purely hypothetical question:\nwhether the traffic stop in this case would be unreason-\nable if the police officer, prior to leading a drug-sniffing dog\naround the exterior of petitioner’s car, did not already\nhave reasonable suspicion that the car contained drugs.\nIn fact, however, the police officer did have reasonable\nsuspicion, and, as a result, the officer was justified in\ndetaining the occupants for the short period of time (seven\nor eight minutes) that is at issue.\n   The relevant facts are not in dispute. Officer Struble,\nwho made the stop, was the only witness at the suppres-\nsion hearing, and his testimony about what happened was\nnot challenged. Defense counsel argued that the facts\nrecounted by Officer Struble were insufficient to establish\nreasonable suspicion, but defense counsel did not dispute\nthose facts or attack the officer’s credibility. Similarly, the\nMagistrate Judge who conducted the hearing did not\nquestion the officer’s credibility.          And as JUSTICE\nTHOMAS’s opinion shows, the facts recounted by Officer\nStruble “easily meet our standard for reasonable suspi-\ncion.” Ante, at 11 (dissenting opinion); see also, e.g., United\n——————\n 1 See   Brief in Opposition 11–14.\n2              RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nStates v. Carpenter, 462 F. 3d 981, 986–987 (CA8 2006)\n(finding reasonable suspicion for a dog sniff based on\nimplausible travel plans and nervous conduct); United\nStates v. Ludwig, 641 F. 3d 1243, 1248–1250 (CA10 2011)\n(finding reasonable suspicion for a dog sniff where, among\nother things, the officer smelled “strong masking odors,”\nthe defendant’s “account of his travel was suspect,” and\nthe defendant “was exceptionally nervous throughout his\nencounter”).\n   Not only does the Court reach out to decide a question\nnot really presented by the facts in this case, but the\nCourt’s answer to that question is arbitrary. The Court\nrefuses to address the real Fourth Amendment question:\nwhether the stop was unreasonably prolonged. Instead,\nthe Court latches onto the fact that Officer Struble deliv-\nered the warning prior to the dog sniff and proclaims that\nthe authority to detain based on a traffic stop ends when a\ncitation or warning is handed over to the driver. The\nCourt thus holds that the Fourth Amendment was vio-\nlated, not because of the length of the stop, but simply be-\ncause of the sequence in which Officer Struble chose to\nperform his tasks.\n   This holding is not only arbitrary; it is perverse since\nOfficer Struble chose that sequence for the purpose of\nprotecting his own safety and possibly the safety of others.\nSee App. 71–72. Without prolonging the stop, Officer\nStruble could have conducted the dog sniff while one of the\ntasks that the Court regards as properly part of the traffic\nstop was still in progress, but that sequence would have\nentailed unnecessary risk. At approximately 12:19 a.m.,\nafter collecting Pollman’s driver’s license, Officer Struble\ndid two things. He called in the information needed to do\na records check on Pollman (a step that the Court recog-\nnizes was properly part of the traffic stop), and he re-\nquested that another officer report to the scene. Officer\nStruble had decided to perform a dog sniff but did not\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwant to do that without another officer present. When\noccupants of a vehicle who know that their vehicle con-\ntains a large amount of illegal drugs see that a drug-\nsniffing dog has alerted for the presence of drugs, they will\nalmost certainly realize that the police will then proceed to\nsearch the vehicle, discover the drugs, and make arrests.\nThus, it is reasonable for an officer to believe that an alert\nwill increase the risk that the occupants of the vehicle will\nattempt to flee or perhaps even attack the officer. See,\ne.g., United States v. Dawdy, 46 F. 3d 1427, 1429 (CA8\n1995) (recounting scuffle between officer and defendant\nafter drugs were discovered).\n   In this case, Officer Struble was concerned that he was\noutnumbered at the scene, and he therefore called for\nbackup and waited for the arrival of another officer before\nconducting the sniff. As a result, the sniff was not com-\npleted until seven or eight minutes after he delivered the\nwarning. But Officer Struble could have proceeded with\nthe dog sniff while he was waiting for the results of the\nrecords check on Pollman and before the arrival of the\nsecond officer. The drug-sniffing dog was present in Of-\nficer Struble’s car. If he had chosen that riskier sequence\nof events, the dog sniff would have been completed before\nthe point in time when, according to the Court’s analysis,\nthe authority to detain for the traffic stop ended. Thus, an\naction that would have been lawful had the officer made\nthe unreasonable decision to risk his life became un-\nlawful when the officer made the reasonable decision to wait\na few minutes for backup. Officer Struble’s error—\napparently—was following prudent procedures motivated\nby legitimate safety concerns. The Court’s holding there-\nfore makes no practical sense. And nothing in the Fourth\nAmendment, which speaks of reasonableness, compels this\narbitrary line.\n   The rule that the Court adopts will do little good going\n4                 RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nforward.2 It is unlikely to have any appreciable effect on\nthe length of future traffic stops. Most officers will learn\nthe prescribed sequence of events even if they cannot\nfathom the reason for that requirement. (I would love to\nbe the proverbial fly on the wall when police instructors\nteach this rule to officers who make traffic stops.)\n  For these reasons and those set out in JUSTICE\nTHOMAS’s opinion, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n    2 It\n       is important to note that the Court’s decision does not affect pro-\ncedures routinely carried out during traffic stops, including “checking\nthe driver’s license, determining whether there are outstanding war-\nrants against the driver, and inspecting the automobile’s registration\nand proof of insurance.” Ante, at 6. And the Court reaffirms that police\n“may conduct certain unrelated checks during an otherwise lawful\ntraffic stop.” Ibid. Thus, it remains true that police may ask questions\naimed at uncovering other criminal conduct and may order occupants\nout of their car during a valid stop. See Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U.
