Argued January 12, 2015—Decided April 21, 2015\nRespondents, a group of manufacturers, hospitals, and other institu-\n  tions that buy natural gas directly from interstate pipelines, sued pe-\n  titioner interstate pipelines, claiming that the pipelines had engaged\n  in behavior that violated state antitrust laws. In particular, re-\n  spondents alleged that petitioners reported false information to the\n  natural-gas indices on which respondents’ natural-gas contracts were\n  based. The indices affected not only retail natural-gas prices, but al-\n  so wholesale natural-gas prices.\n     After removing the cases to federal court, the petitioner pipelines\n  sought summary judgment on the ground that the Natural Gas Act\n  pre-empted respondents’ state-law claims. That Act gives the Feder-\n  al Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to determine\n  whether rates charged by natural-gas companies or practices affect-\n  ing such rates are unreasonable. 15 U. S. C. §717d(a). But it also\n  limits FERC’s jurisdiction to the transportation of natural gas in in-\n  terstate commerce, the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for\n  resale, and natural-gas companies engaged in such transportation or\n  sale. §717(b). The Act leaves regulation of other portions of the in-\n  dustry—such as retail sales—to the States. Ibid.\n     The District Court granted petitioners’ motion for summary judg-\n  ment, reasoning that because petitioners’ challenged practices direct-\n  ly affected wholesale as well as retail prices, they were pre-empted by\n  the Act. The Ninth Circuit reversed. While acknowledging that the\n  pipelines’ index manipulation increased wholesale prices as well as\n  retail prices, it held that the state-law claims were not pre-empted\n  because they were aimed at obtaining damages only for excessively\n  high retail prices.\nHeld: Respondents’ state-law antitrust claims are not within the field of\n2                    ONEOK, INC. v.

Pp. 10–16.\n       (a) The Act “was drawn with meticulous regard for the continued\n    exercise of state power.” Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Public\n    Serv. Comm’n of Ind., 332 U. S. 507, 517–518. Where, as here, a\n    practice affects nonjurisdictional as well as jurisdictional sales, pre-\n    emption can be found only where a detailed examination convincingly\n    demonstrates that a matter falls within the pre-empted field as de-\n    fined by this Court’s precedents. Those precedents emphasize the\n    importance of considering the target at which the state-law claims\n    aim. See, e.g., Northern Natural Gas Co. v. State Corporation\n    Comm’n of Kan., 372 U. S. 84; Northwest Central Pipeline Corp. v.\n    State Corporation Comm’n of Kan., 489 U. S. 493. Here, respondents’\n    claims are aimed at practices affecting retail prices, a matter “firmly\n    on the States’ side of [the] dividing line.” Id., at 514.\n       Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U. S. 293, is not to the con-\n    trary. That opinion explains that the Act does not pre-empt “tradi-\n    tional” state regulation, such as blue sky laws. Id., at 308, n. 11. An-\n    titrust laws, like blue sky laws, are not aimed at natural-gas\n    companies in particular, but rather all businesses in the market-\n    place. The broad applicability of state antitrust laws supports a find-\n    ing of no pre-emption here.\n       So, too, does the fact that States have long provided “common-law\n    and statutory remedies against monopolies and unfair business prac-\n    tices,” California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U. S. 93, 101. As noted\n    earlier, the Act circumscribes FERC’s powers and preserves tradi-\n    tional areas of state authority. §717(b). Pp. 10–14.\n       (b) Neither Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel.\n    Moore, 487 U. S. 354, nor FPC v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 406\n    U. S. 621, supports petitioners’ position. Mississippi Power is best\n    read as a conflict pre-emption case, not a field pre-emption case. In\n    any event, the state inquiry in Mississippi Power was pre-empted be-\n    cause it was directed at jurisdictional sales in a way that respond-\n    ents’ state antitrust suits are not. Louisiana Power is also a conflict\n    pre-emption case, and thus does not significantly help petitioners’\n    field pre-emption argument. Pp. 14–15.\n       (c) Because the parties have not argued conflict pre-emption, ques-\n    tions involving conflicts between state antitrust proceedings and the\n    federal rate-setting process are left for the lower courts to resolve in\n    the first instance. Pp. 15–16.\n       (d) While petitioners and the Government argue that this Court\n    should defer to FERC’s determination that field pre-emption bars re-\n    spondents’ claims, they fail to point to a specific FERC determination\n    that state antitrust claims fall within the field pre-empted by the\n    Natural Gas Act.

The question is whether the\nfederal Natural Gas Act pre-empts these lawsuits. We\nhave said that, in passing the Act, “Congress occupied the\nfield of matters relating to wholesale sales and transporta­\ntion of natural gas in interstate commerce.” Schneidewind\nv. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U. S. 293, 305 (1988). Neverthe­\nless, for the reasons given below, we conclude that the Act\ndoes not pre-empt the state-law antitrust suits at issue\nhere.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The Supremacy Clause provides that “the Laws of the\nUnited States” (as well as treaties and the Constitution\nitself ) “shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any\n2                ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the\nContrary notwithstanding.” Art. VI, cl. 2. Congress may\nconsequently pre-empt, i.e., invalidate, a state law through\nfederal legislation. It may do so through express language\nin a statute. But even where, as here, a statute does not\nrefer expressly to pre-emption, Congress may implicitly\npre-empt a state law, rule, or other state action. See\nSprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 64 (2002).\n   It may do so either through “field” pre-emption or “con­\nflict” pre-emption. As to the former, Congress may have\nintended “to foreclose any state regulation in the area,”\nirrespective of whether state law is consistent or incon­\nsistent with “federal standards.” Arizona v. United States,\n567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 10) (emphasis added).\nIn such situations, Congress has forbidden the State to\ntake action in the field that the federal statute pre-empts.\n   By contrast, conflict pre-emption exists where “compli­\nance with both state and federal law is impossible,” or\nwhere “the state law ‘stands as an obstacle to the accom­\nplishment and execution of the full purposes and objec­\ntives of Congress.’ ” California v. ARC America Corp., 490\nU. S. 93, 100, 101 (1989). In either situation, federal law\nmust prevail.\n   No one here claims that any relevant federal statute\nexpressly pre-empts state antitrust lawsuits. Nor have\nthe parties argued at any length that these state suits\nconflict with federal law. Rather, the interstate pipeline\ncompanies (petitioners here) argue that Congress implic-\nitly “‘occupied the field of matters relating to wholesale sales\nand transportation of natural gas in interstate com­\nmerce.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 18 (quoting Schneidewind,\nsupra, at 305 (emphasis added)). And they contend that\nthe state antitrust claims advanced by their direct-sales\ncustomers (respondents here) fall within that field. The\nUnited States, supporting the pipelines, argues similarly.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15. Since\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 283 (1997). First, natural-gas\nproducers sunk wells in large oil and gas fields (such as\nthe Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico). They\ngathered the gas, brought it to transportation points, and\nleft it to interstate gas pipelines to transport the gas to\ndistant markets. Second, interstate pipelines shipped the\ngas from the field to cities and towns across the Nation.\nThird, local gas distributors bought the gas from the inter­\nstate pipelines and resold it to business and residential\ncustomers within their localities.\n   Originally, the States regulated all three segments of\nthe industry. See 1 Mogel §1.03. But in the early 20th\ncentury, this Court held that the Commerce Clause forbids\nthe States to regulate the second part of the business—i.e.,\nthe interstate shipment and sale of gas to local distribu­\ntors for resale. See, e.g., Public Util. Comm’n of R. I. v.\nAttleboro Steam & Elec. Co., 273 U. S. 83, 89–90 (1927);\nMissouri ex rel. Barrett v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 265\nU. S. 298, 307–308 (1924). These holdings left a regula-\ntory gap. Congress enacted the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat.\n821, to fill it. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, 347\nU. S. 672, 682–684, n. 13 (1954) (citing H. R. Rep. No. 709,\n75th Cong., 1st Sess., 1–2 (1937); S. Rep. No. 1162, 75th\nCong., 1st Sess., 1–2 (1937)).\n   The Act, in §5(a), gives rate-setting authority to the\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC, formerly\n4               ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Federal Power Commission (FPC)). That authority\nallows FERC to determine whether “any rate, charge, or\nclassification . . . collected by any natural-gas company in\nconnection with any transportation or sale of natural gas,\nsubject to the jurisdiction of [FERC],” or “any rule, regula­\ntion, practice, or contract affecting such rate, charge, or\nclassification is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discrimina­\ntory, or preferential.” 15 U. S. C. §717d(a) (emphasis\nadded). As the italicized words make clear, §5(a) limits\nthe scope of FERC’s authority to activities “in connection\nwith any transportation or sale of natural gas, subject to\nthe jurisdiction of the Commission.” Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). And the Act, in §1(b), limits FERC’s “jurisdiction” to\n(1) “the transportation of natural gas in interstate com­\nmerce,” (2) “the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas\nfor resale,” and (3) “natural-gas companies engaged in\nsuch transportation or sale.” §717(b). The Act leaves\nregulation of other portions of the industry—such as pro­\nduction, local distribution facilities, and direct sales—to\nthe States. See Northwest Central Pipeline Corp. v. State\nCorporation Comm’n of Kan., 489 U. S. 493, 507 (1989)\n(Section 1(b) of the Act “expressly” provides that “States\nretain jurisdiction over intrastate transportation, local\ndistribution, and distribution facilities, and over ‘the\nproduction or gathering of natural gas’ ”).\n   To simplify our discussion, we shall describe the firms\nthat engage in interstate transportation as “jurisdictional\nsellers” or “interstate pipelines” (though various brokers\nand others may also fall within the Act’s jurisdictional\nscope). Similarly, we shall refer to the sales over which\nFERC has jurisdiction as “jurisdictional sales” or “whole­\nsale sales.”\n                             2\n  Until the 1970’s, natural-gas regulation roughly tracked\nthe industry model we described above. Interstate pipe­\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlines would typically buy gas from field producers and\nresell it to local distribution companies for resale. See\nTracy, supra, at 283. FERC (or FPC), acting under the\nauthority of the Natural Gas Act, would set interstate\npipeline wholesale rates using classical “cost-of-service”\nratemaking methods. See Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y. v.\nMid-Louisiana Gas Co., 463 U. S. 319, 328 (1983). That\nis, FERC would determine a pipeline’s revenue require­\nment by calculating the costs of providing its services,\nincluding operating and maintenance expenses, deprecia­\ntion expenses, taxes, and a reasonable profit. See FERC,\nCost-of-Service Rates Manual 6 (June 1999). FERC would\nthen set wholesale rates at a level designed to meet the\npipeline’s revenue requirement.\n   Deregulation of the natural-gas industry, however,\nbrought about changes in FERC’s approach. In the 1950’s,\nthis Court had held that the Natural Gas Act required\nregulation of prices at the interstate pipelines’ buying\nend—i.e., the prices at which field producers sold natural\ngas to interstate pipelines. Phillips Petroleum Co., supra,\nat 682, 685. By the 1970’s, many in Congress thought that\nsuch efforts to regulate field prices had jeopardized\nnatural-gas supplies in an industry already dependent “on\nthe caprice of nature.” FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320\nU. S. 591, 630 (1944) (opinion of Jackson, J.); see id., at\n629 (recognizing that “the wealth of Midas and the wit of\nman cannot produce . . . a natural gas field”). Hoping to\navoid future shortages, Congress enacted forms of field\nprice deregulation designed to rely upon competition,\nrather than regulation, to keep field prices low. See, e.g.,\nNatural Gas Policy Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 3409, codified in\npart at 15 U. S. C. §3301 et seq. (phasing out regulation of\nwellhead prices charged by producers of natural gas);\nNatural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989, 103 Stat.\n157 (removing price controls on wellhead sales as of Janu­\nary 1993).\n6               ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   FERC promulgated new regulations designed to further\nthis process of deregulation. See, e.g., Regulation of Natu­\nral Gas Pipelines after Partial Wellhead Decontrol, 50\nFed. Reg. 42408 (1985) (allowing “open access” to pipelines\nso that consumers could pay to ship their own gas). Most\nimportant here, FERC adopted an approach that relied on\nthe competitive marketplace, rather than classical regula­\ntory rate-setting, as the main mechanism for keeping\nwholesale natural-gas rates at a reasonable level. Order\nNo. 636, issued in 1992, allowed FERC to issue blanket\ncertificates that permitted jurisdictional sellers (typically\ninterstate pipelines) to charge market-based rates for gas,\nprovided that FERC had first determined that the sellers\nlacked market power. See 57 Fed. Reg. 57957–57958\n(1992); id., at 13270.\n   After the issuance of this order, FERC’s oversight of the\nnatural-gas market largely consisted of (1) ex ante exami­\nnations of jurisdictional sellers’ market power, and (2) the\navailability of a complaint process under §717d(a). See\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4. The new\nsystem also led many large gas consumers—such as indus­\ntrial and commercial users—to buy their own gas directly\nfrom gas producers, and to arrange (and often pay sepa­\nrately) for transportation from the field to the place of\nconsumption. See Tracy, 519 U. S., at 284. Insofar as\ninterstate pipelines sold gas to such consumers, they sold\nit for direct consumption rather than resale.\n                             3\n   The free-market system for setting interstate pipeline\nrates turned out to be less than perfect. Interstate pipe­\nlines, distributing companies, and many of the customers\nwho bought directly from the pipelines found that they\nhad to rely on privately published price indices to deter­\nmine appropriate prices for their natural-gas contracts.\nThese indices listed the prices at which natural gas was\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbeing sold in different (presumably competitive) markets\nacross the country. The information on which these in-\ndices were based was voluntarily reported by natural-gas\ntraders.\n   In 2003, FERC found that the indices were inaccurate,\nin part because much of the information that natural-gas\ntraders reported had been false. See FERC, Final Report\non Price Manipulation in Western Markets (Mar. 2003),\nApp. 88–89. FERC found that false reporting had involved\n“inflating the volume of trades, omitting trades, and ad­\njusting the price of trades.” Id., at 88. That is, sometimes\nthose who reported information simply fabricated it.\nOther times, the information reported reflected “wash\ntrades,” i.e., “prearranged pair[s] of trades of the same\ngood between the same parties, involving no economic risk\nand no net change in beneficial ownership.” Id., at 215.\nFERC concluded that these “efforts to manipulate price\nindices compiled by trade publications” had helped raise\n“to extraordinary levels” the prices of both jurisdictional\nsales (that is, interstate pipeline sales for resale) and\nnonjurisdictional direct sales to ultimate consumers. Id.,\nat 86, 85.\n   After issuing its final report on price manipulation in\nwestern markets, FERC issued a Code of Conduct. That\ncode amended all blanket certificates to prohibit jurisdic­\ntional sellers “from engaging in actions without a legiti­\nmate business purpose that manipulate or attempt to\nmanipulate market conditions, including wash trades and\ncollusion.” 68 Fed. Reg. 66324 (2003). The code also\nrequired jurisdictional companies, when they provided\ninformation to natural-gas index publishers, to “provide\naccurate and factual information, and not knowingly\nsubmit false or misleading information or omit material\ninformation to any such publisher.” Id., at 66337. At the\nsame time, FERC issued a policy statement setting forth\n“minimum standards for creation and publication of any\n8               ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nenergy price index,” and “for reporting transaction data to\nindex developers.” Price Discovery in Natural Gas and\nElec. Markets, 104 FERC ¶61,121, pp. 61,407, 61,408\n(2003). Finally, FERC, after finding that certain jurisdic­\ntional sellers had “engaged in wash trading . . . that re­\nsulted in the manipulation of [natural-gas] prices,” termi­\nnated those sellers’ blanket marketing certificates. Enron\nPower Marketing, Inc., 103 FERC ¶61,343, p. 62,303\n(2003).\n   Congress also took steps to address these problems. In\nparticular, it passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, 119\nStat. 594, which gives FERC the authority to issue rules\nand regulations to prevent “any manipulative or deceptive\ndevice or contrivance” by “any entity . . . in connection\nwith the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or\nsale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction\nof ” FERC, 15 U. S. C. §717c–1.\n                              C\n  We now turn to the cases before us. Respondents, as we\nhave said, bought large quantities of natural gas directly\nfrom interstate pipelines for their own consumption. They\nbelieve that they overpaid in these transactions due to the\ninterstate pipelines’ manipulation of the natural-gas\nindices. Based on this belief, they filed state-law antitrust\nsuits against petitioners in state and federal courts. See\nApp. 244–246 (alleging violations of Wis. Stat. §§133.03,\n133.14, 133.18); see also App. 430–433 (same); id., at 519–\n521 (same); id., at 362–364 (alleging violations of Kansas\nRestraint of Trade Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. §50–101 et seq.);\nApp. 417–419 (alleging violations of Missouri Antitrust\nLaw, Mo. Rev. Stat. §§416.011–416.161). The pipelines\nremoved all the state cases to federal court, where they\nwere consolidated and sent for pretrial proceedings to the\nFederal District Court for the District of Nevada. See 28\nU. S.

It concluded that the pipelines were “juris­\ndictional sellers,” i.e., “natural gas companies engaged in”\nthe “transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.”\nOrder in No. 03–cv–1431 (D Nev., July 18, 2011), pp. 4, 11.\nAnd it held that respondents’ claims, which were “aimed\nat” these sellers’ “alleged practices of false price reporting,\nwash trades, and anticompetitive collusive behavior” were\npre-empted because “such practices,” not only affected\nnonjurisdictional direct-sale prices but also “directly af­\nfect[ed]” jurisdictional (i.e., wholesale) rates. Id., at 36–37.\n  The Ninth Circuit reversed. It emphasized that the\nprice-manipulation of which respondents complained\naffected not only jurisdictional (i.e., wholesale) sales, but\nalso nonjurisdictional (i.e., retail) sales. The court con­\nstrued the Natural Gas Act’s pre-emptive scope narrowly\nin light of Congress’ intent—manifested in §1(b) of the\nAct—to preserve for the States the authority to regulate\nnonjurisdictional sales. And it held that the Act did not\npre-empt state-law claims aimed at obtaining damages for\nexcessively high retail natural-gas prices stemming from\ninterstate pipelines’ price manipulation, even if the ma­\nnipulation raised wholesale rates as well. See In re West-\nern States Wholesale Natural Gas Antitrust Litigation, 715\nF. 3d 716, 729–736 (2013).\n  The pipelines sought certiorari. They asked us to re­\nsolve confusion in the lower courts as to whether the\nNatural Gas Act pre-empts retail customers’ state anti­\ntrust law challenges to practices that also affect wholesale\nrates. Compare id., at 729–736, with Leggett v. Duke\nEnergy Corp., 308 S. W. 3d 843 (Tenn. 2010). We granted\nthe petition.\n10              ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             II\n   Petitioners, supported by the United States, argue that\ntheir customers’ state antitrust lawsuits are within the\nfield that the Natural Gas Act pre-empts. See Brief for\nPetitioners 18 (citing Schneidewind, 485 U. S., at 305);\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13 (same). They\npoint out that respondents’ antitrust claims target anti­\ncompetitive activities that affected wholesale (as well as\nretail) rates. See Brief for Petitioners 2. They add that\nthe Natural Gas Act expressly grants FERC authority to\nkeep wholesale rates at reasonable levels. See ibid. (citing\n15 U. S. C. §§717(b), 717d(a)). In exercising this authority,\nFERC has prohibited the very kind of anticompetitive\nconduct that the state actions attack. See Part I–B–3,\nsupra. And, petitioners contend, letting these actions\nproceed will permit state antitrust courts to reach conclu­\nsions about that conduct that differ from those that FERC\nmight reach or has already reached. Accordingly, peti­\ntioners argue, respondents’ state-law antitrust suits fall\nwithin the pre-empted field.\n                              A\n   Petitioners’ arguments are forceful, but we cannot ac­\ncept their conclusion. As we have repeatedly stressed, the\nNatural Gas Act “was drawn with meticulous regard for\nthe continued exercise of state power, not to handicap or\ndilute it in any way.” Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v.\nPublic Serv. Comm’n of Ind., 332 U. S. 507, 517–518\n(1947); see also Northwest Central, 489 U. S., at 511 (the\n“legislative history of the [Act] is replete with assurances\nthat the Act ‘takes nothing from the State [regulatory]\ncommissions’ ” (quoting 81 Cong. Rec. 6721 (1937))). Ac­\ncordingly, where (as here) a state law can be applied to\nnonjurisdictional as well as jurisdictional sales, we must\nproceed cautiously, finding pre-emption only where de­\ntailed examination convinces us that a matter falls within\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe pre-empted field as defined by our precedents. See\nPanhandle Eastern, supra, at 516–518; Interstate Natural\nGas Co. v. FPC, 331 U. S. 682, 689–693 (1947).\n   Those precedents emphasize the importance of consider­\ning the target at which the state law aims in determining\nwhether that law is pre-empted. For example, in Northern\nNatural Gas Co. v. State Corporation Comm’n of Kan., 372\nU. S. 84 (1963), the Court said that it had “consistently\nrecognized” that the “significant distinction” for purposes\nof pre-emption in the natural-gas context is the distinction\nbetween “measures aimed directly at interstate purchasers\nand wholesales for resale, and those aimed at” subjects left\nto the States to regulate. Id., at 94 (emphasis added).\nAnd, in Northwest Central, the Court found that the Natu­\nral Gas Act did not pre-empt a state regulation concerning\nthe timing of gas production from a gas field within the\nState, even though the regulation might have affected the\ncosts of and the prices of interstate wholesale sales, i.e.,\njurisdictional sales. 489 U. S., at 514. In reaching this\nconclusion, the Court explained that the state regulation\naimed primarily at “protect[ing] producers’ . . . rights—a\nmatter firmly on the States’ side of that dividing line.”\nIbid. The Court contrasted this state regulation with the\nstate orders at issue in Northern Natural, which “ ‘inva-\nlidly invade[d] the federal agency’s exclusive domain’ pre-\ncisely because” they were “‘unmistakably and unambiguously\ndirected at purchasers.’ ” Id., at 513 (quoting Northern\nNatural, supra, at 92; emphasis added). Here, too, the\nlawsuits are directed at practices affecting retail rates–\nwhich are “firmly on the States’ side of that dividing line.”\n   Petitioners argue that Schneidewind constitutes con-\ntrary authority. In that case, the Court found pre-empted a\nstate law that required public utilities, such as interstate\npipelines crossing the State, to obtain state approval\nbefore issuing long-term securities. 485 U. S., at 306–309.\nBut the Court there thought that the State’s securities\n12              ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nregulation was aimed directly at interstate pipelines. It\nwrote that the state law was designed to keep “a natural\ngas company from raising its equity levels above a certain\npoint” in order to keep the company’s revenue requirement\nlow, thereby ensuring lower wholesale rates. Id., at 307–\n308. Indeed, the Court expressly said that the state law\nwas pre-empted because it was “directed at . . . the control\nof rates and facilities of natural gas companies,” “precisely\nthe things over which FERC has comprehensive author-\nity.” Id., at 308 (emphasis added).\n   The dissent rejects the notion that the proper test for\npurposes of pre-emption in the natural gas context is\nwhether the challenged measures are “aimed directly at\ninterstate purchasers and wholesales for resale” or not.\nNorthern Natural, supra, at 94. It argues that this ap­\nproach is “unprecedented,” and that the Court’s focus\nshould be on “what the State seeks to regulate . . . , not\nwhy the State seeks to regulate it.” Post, at 6 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.). But the “target” to which our cases refer must\nmean more than just the physical activity that a State\nregulates. After all, a single physical action, such as\nreporting a price to a specialized journal, could be the\nsubject of many different laws—including tax laws, disclo­\nsure laws, and others. To repeat the point we made above,\nno one could claim that FERC’s regulation of this physical\nactivity for purposes of wholesale rates forecloses every\nother form of state regulation that affects those rates.\n   Indeed, although the dissent argues that Schneidwind\ncreated a definitive test for pre-emption in the natural gas\ncontext that turns on whether “the matter on which the\nState asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by\nthe Federal Act,” post, at 3 (quoting 485 U. S., at 310,\nn. 13), Schneidewind could not mean this statement as an\nabsolute test. It goes on to explain that the Natural Gas\nAct does not pre-empt “traditional” state regulation, such\nas state blue sky laws (which, of course, raise wholesale—\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nas well as retail—investment costs). Id., at 308, n. 11.\n    Antitrust laws, like blue sky laws, are not aimed at\nnatural-gas companies in particular, but rather all busi­\nnesses in the marketplace. See ibid. They are far broader\nin their application than, for example, the regulations at\nissue in Northern Natural, which applied only to entities\nbuying gas from fields within the State. See 372 U. S., at\n85–86, n. 1; contra, post, at 5–6 (stating that Northern\nNatural concerned “background market conditions”). This\nbroad applicability of state antitrust law supports a find­\ning of no pre-emption here.\n    Petitioners and the dissent argue that there is, or\nshould be, a clear division between areas of state and\nfederal authority in natural-gas regulation. See Brief for\nPetitioners 18; post, at 7. But that Platonic ideal does not\ndescribe the natural gas regulatory world.          Suppose\nFERC, when setting wholesale rates in the former cost-of­\nservice rate-making days, had denied cost recovery for\npipelines’ failure to recycle. Would that fact deny States\nthe power to enact and apply recycling laws? These state\nlaws might well raise pipelines’ operating costs, and thus\nthe costs of wholesale natural gas transportation. But in\nNorthwest Central we said that “[t]o find field pre-emption\nof [state] regulation merely because purchasers’ costs and\nhence rates might be affected would be largely to nullify\n. . . §1(b).” 489 U. S., at 514.\n    The dissent barely mentions the limitations on FERC’s\npowers in §1(b), but the enumeration of FERC’s powers in\n§5(a) is circumscribed by a reference back to the limita­\ntions in §1(b). See post, at 1–3. As we explained above,\nsee Part I–B–1, supra, those limits are key to understand­\ning the careful balance between federal and state regula­\ntion that Congress struck when it passed the Natural Gas\nAct. That Act “was drawn with meticulous regard for the\ncontinued exercise of state power, not to handicap or\ndilute it in any way.” Panhandle Eastern, 332 U. S., at\n14              ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n517–518. Contra, post, at 8. States have a “long history\nof ” providing “common-law and statutory remedies\nagainst monopolies and unfair business practices.” ARC\nAmerica, 490 U. S., at 101; see also Watson v. Buck, 313\nU. S. 387, 404 (1941) (noting the States’ “long-recognized\npower to regulate combinations in restraint of trade”).\nRespondents’ state-law antitrust suits relied on this well\nestablished state power.\n                              B\n  Petitioners point to two other cases that they believe\nsupport their position. The first is Mississippi Power &\nLight Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U. S. 354 (1988).\nThere, the Court held that the Federal Power Act—which\ngives FERC the authority to determine whether rates\ncharged by public utilities in electric energy sales are “just\nand reasonable,” 16 U. S. C. §824d(a)—pre-empted a state\ninquiry into the reasonableness of FERC-approved prices\nfor the sale of nuclear power to wholesalers of electricity\n(which led to higher retail electricity rates). 487 U. S., at\n373–377. Petitioners argue that this case shows that state\nregulation of similar sales here—i.e., by a pipeline to a\ndirect consumer—must also be pre-empted. See Reply\nBrief 11–12. Mississippi Power, however, is best read as a\nconflict pre-emption case, not a field pre-emption case.\nSee 487 U. S., at 377 (“[A] state agency’s ‘efforts to regu­\nlate commerce must fall when they conflict with or inter­\nfere with federal authority over the same activity’ ” (quot­\ning Chicago & North Western Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick &\nTile Co., 450 U. S. 311, 318–319 (1981))).\n  Regardless, the state inquiry in Mississippi Power was\npre-empted because it was directed at jurisdictional sales\nin a way that respondents’ state antitrust lawsuits are\nnot. Mississippi’s inquiry into the reasonableness of\nFERC-approved purchases was effectively an attempt to\n“regulate in areas where FERC has properly exercised its\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdiction to determine just and reasonable wholesale\nrates.” 487 U. S., at 374. By contrast, respondents’ state\nantitrust lawsuits do not seek to challenge the reason-\nableness of any rates expressly approved by FERC. Rather,\nthey seek to challenge the background marketplace condi­\ntions that affected both jurisdictional and nonjurisdic-\ntional rates.\n   Petitioners additionally point to FPC v. Louisiana Power\n& Light Co., 406 U. S. 621 (1972). In that case, the Court\nheld that federal law gave FPC the authority to allocate\nnatural gas during shortages by ordering interstate pipe­\nlines to curtail gas deliveries to all customers, including\nretail customers. This latter fact, the pipelines argue,\nshows that FERC has authority to regulate index manipu­\nlation insofar as that manipulation affects retail (as well\nas wholesale) sales. Brief for Petitioners 26. Accordingly,\nthey contend that state laws that aim at this same subject\nare pre-empted.\n   This argument, however, makes too much of too little.\nThe Court’s finding of pre-emption in Louisiana Power\nrested on its belief that the state laws in question con-\nflicted with federal law. The Court concluded that “FPC\nhas authority to effect orderly curtailment plans involving\nboth direct sales and sales for resale,” 406 U. S., at 631,\nbecause otherwise there would be “unavoidable conflict\nbetween” state regulation of direct sales and the “uniform\nfederal regulation” that the Natural Gas Act foresees, id.,\nat 633–635. Conflict pre-emption may, of course, invali­\ndate a state law even though field pre-emption does not.\nBecause petitioners have not argued this case as a conflict\npre-emption case, Louisiana Power does not offer them\nsignificant help.\n                             C\n  To the extent any conflicts arise between state antitrust\nlaw proceedings and the federal rate-setting process, the\n16             ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndoctrine of conflict pre-emption should prove sufficient to\naddress them. But as we have noted, see Part I–A, supra,\nthe parties have not argued conflict pre-emption. See also,\ne.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 24 (Solicitor General agrees that he\nhas not “analyzed this [case] under a conflict preemption\nregime”). We consequently leave conflict pre-emption\nquestions for the lower courts to resolve in the first\ninstance.\n                              D\n   We note that petitioners and the Solicitor General have\nargued that we should defer to FERC’s determination that\nfield pre-emption bars the respondents’ claims. See Brief\nfor Petitioners 22 (citing Arlington v. FCC, 569 U. S. ___,\n___–___ (2013) (slip op., at 10–14); Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 32 (same). But they have not pointed to\na specific FERC determination that state antitrust claims\nfall within the field pre-empted by the Natural Gas Act.\nRather, they point only to the fact that FERC has promul­\ngated detailed rules governing manipulation of price\nindices. Because there is no determination by FERC that\nits regulation pre-empts the field into which respondents’\nstate-law antitrust suits fall, we need not consider what\nlegal effect such a determination might have. And we\nconclude that the detailed federal regulations here do not\noffset the other considerations that weigh against a find­\ning of pre-emption in this context.\n                         *     *   *\n  For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit is affirmed.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

I write separately to reiterate my view that “implied\npre-emption doctrines that wander far from the statutory\ntext are inconsistent with the Constitution.” Wyeth v.\nLevine, 555 U. S. 555, 583 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring\nin judgment). The Supremacy Clause of our Constitution\n“gives ‘supreme’ status only to those [federal laws] that\nare ‘made in Pursuance’ ” of it. Id., at 585 (quoting Art. VI,\ncl. 2). And to be “made in Pursuance” of the Constitution,\na law must fall within one of Congress’ enumerated pow-\ners and be promulgated in accordance with the lawmaking\nprocedures set forth in that document. Id., at 585–586.\n“The Supremacy Clause thus requires that pre-emptive\neffect be given only to those federal standards and policies\nthat are set forth in, or necessarily follow from, the statu-\ntory text that was produced through the constitutionally\nrequired bicameral and presentment procedures.” Id., at\n586.\n   In light of this constitutional requirement, I have doubts\nabout the legitimacy of this Court’s precedents concern-\ning the pre-emptive scope of the Natural Gas Act, see, e.g.,\nNorthern Natural Gas Co. v.

The Act\nand our cases interpreting it draw a firm line between\nnational and local authority over this trade: If the Federal\nGovernment may regulate a subject, the States may not.\nToday the Court smudges this line. It holds that States\nmay use their antitrust laws to regulate practices already\nregulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\nwhenever “other considerations . . . weigh against a find-\ning of pre-emption.” Ante, at 16. The Court’s make-it-up-\nas-you-go-along approach to preemption has no basis in\nthe Act, contradicts our cases, and will prove unworkable\nin practice.\n                              I\n  Trade in natural gas consists of three parts. A drilling\ncompany collects gas from the earth; a pipeline company\nthen carries the gas to its destination and sells it at\nwholesale to a local distributor; and the local distributor\nsells the gas at retail to industries and households. See\nante, at 3. The Natural Gas Act empowers the Commis-\nsion to regulate the middle of this three-leg journey—\ninterstate transportation and wholesale sales. 15 U. S. C.\n2              ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n§717 et seq. But it does not empower the Commission to\nregulate the opening and closing phases—production at\none end, retail sales at the other—thus leaving those\nmatters to the States. §717(b). (Like the Court, I will for\nsimplicity’s sake call the sales controlled by the Commis-\nsion wholesale sales, and the companies controlled by the\nCommission pipelines. See ante, at 4.)\n   Over 70 years ago, the Court concluded that the Act\nconfers “exclusive jurisdiction upon the federal regulatory\nagency.” Public Util. Comm’n of Ohio v. United Fuel Gas\nCo., 317 U. S. 456, 469 (1943). The Court thought it\n“clear” that the Act contemplates “a harmonious, dual\nsystem of regulation of the natural gas industry—federal\nand state regulatory bodies operating side by side, each\nactive in its own sphere,” “without any confusion of func-\ntions.” Id., at 467. The Court drew this inference from the\nlaw’s purpose and legislative history, though it could just\nas easily have relied on the law’s terms and structure.\nThe Act grants the Commission a wide range of powers\nover wholesale sales and transportation, but qualifies only\nsome of these powers with reservations of state authority\nover the same subject. See §717g(a) (concurrent authority\nover recordkeeping); §717h(a) (concurrent authority over\ndepreciation and amortization rates). Congress’s decision\nto include express reservations of state power alongside\nthese grants of authority, but to omit them alongside other\ngrants of authority, suggests that the other grants are\nexclusive. Right or wrong, in any event, our inference of\nexclusivity is now settled beyond debate.\n   United Fuel rejected a State’s regulation of wholesale\nrates. Id., at 468. But our later holdings establish that\nthe Act makes exclusive the Commission’s powers in\ngeneral, not just its rate-setting power in particular. We\nhave again and again set aside state laws—even those\nthat do not purport to fix wholesale rates—for regulating a\nmatter already subject to regulation by the Commission.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

S. 176, 185 (1983) (state law prohibiting\nproducers from passing on production taxes preempted\nbecause it “trespasse[s] upon FERC’s authority”);\nSchneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U. S. 293, 309\n(1988) (state securities regulation directly affecting whole-\nsale rates and gas transportation facilities preempted\nbecause it regulates “matters that Congress intended\nFERC to regulate”). The test for preemption in this set-\nting, the Court has confirmed, “ ‘is whether the matter on\nwhich the State asserts the right to act is in any way\nregulated by the Federal Act.’ ” Id., at 310, n. 13.\n  Straightforward application of these precedents would\nmake short work of the case at hand. The Natural Gas\nAct empowers the Commission to regulate “practice[s] . . .\naffecting [wholesale] rate[s].” §717d. Nothing in the Act\nsuggests that the States share power to regulate these\npractices. The Commission has reasonably determined\nthat this power allows it to regulate the behavior involved\nin this case, pipelines’ use of sham trades and false reports\nto manipulate gas price indices. Because the Commis-\nsion’s exclusive authority extends to the conduct chal-\nlenged here, state antitrust regulation of that conduct is\npreempted.\n                            II\n   The Court agrees that the Commission may regulate\nindex manipulation, but upholds state antitrust regulation\nof this practice anyway on account of “other considerations\nthat weigh against a finding of pre-emption in this con-\ntext.” Ante, at 16. That is an unprecedented decision.\nThe Court does not identify a single case—not one—in\n4               ONEOK, INC. v.

The Court’s justifi-\ncations for its novel approach do not persuade.\n                               A\n   The Court begins by considering “the target at which the\nstate law aims.” Ante, at 11. It reasons that because this\ncase involves a practice that affects both wholesale and\nretail rates, the Act tolerates state regulation that takes\naim at the practice’s retail-stage effects. Ibid.\n   This analysis misunderstands how the Natural Gas Act\ndivides responsibilities between national and local regula-\ntors. The Act does not give the Commission the power to\naim at particular effects; it gives it the power to regulate\nparticular activities. When the Commission regulates\nthose activities, it may consider their effects on all parts of\nthe gas trade, not just on wholesale sales. It may, for\nexample, set wholesale rates with the aim of encouraging\nproducers to conserve gas supplies—even though produc-\ntion is a state-regulated activity. See Colorado Interstate\nGas Co. v. FPC, 324 U. S. 581, 602–603 (1945); id., at 609–\n610 (Jackson, J., concurring). Or it may regulate whole-\nsale sales with an eye toward blunting the sales’ anticom-\npetitive effects in the retail market—even though retail\nprices are controlled by the States. See FPC v. Conway\nCorp., 426 U. S. 271, 276–280 (1976). The Court’s ad hoc\npartition of authority over index manipulation—leaving it\nto the Commission to control the practice’s consequences\nfor wholesale sales, but allowing the States to target its\nconsequences for retail sales—thus clashes with the de-\nsign of the Act.\n   To justify its fixation on aims, the Court stresses that\nthis case involves regulation of “background marketplace\nconditions” rather than regulation of wholesale rates or\nsales themselves. Ante, at 15. But the Natural Gas Act\nempowers the Commission to regulate wholesale rates and\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)              5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n“background” practices affecting such rates. It grants both\npowers in the same clause: “Whenever the Commission . . .\nfind[s] that a [wholesale] rate, charge, or classification . . .\n[or] any rule, regulation, practice, or contract affecting\nsuch rate, charge, or classification is unjust [or] unreason-\nable, . . . the Commission shall determine the just and\nreasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation,\npractice, or contract to be thereafter observed.” §717d(a)\n(emphasis added). Nothing in this provision, and for that\nmatter nothing in the Act, suggests that federal authority\nover practices is a second-class power, somehow less ex-\nclusive than the authority over rates.\n   The Court persists that the background conditions in\nthis case affect both wholesale and retail sales. Ante, at\n15. This observation adds atmosphere, but nothing more.\nThe Court concedes that index manipulation’s dual effect\ndoes not weaken the Commission’s power to regulate it.\nAnte, at 10. So too should the Court have seen that this\nsimultaneous effect does not strengthen the claims of the\nStates. It is not at all unusual for an activity controlled by\nthe Commission to have effects in the States’ field; produc-\ntion, wholesale, and retail are after all interdependent\nstages of a single trade. We have never suggested that the\nrules of field preemption change in such situations. For\nexample, producers’ ability to pass production taxes on to\npipelines no doubt affects both producers and pipelines.\nYet we had no trouble concluding that a state law restrict-\ning producers’ ability to pass these taxes impermissibly\nattempted to manage “a matter within the sphere of\nFERC’s regulatory authority.” Exxon, supra, at 185–186.\n   The Court’s approach makes a snarl of our precedents.\nIn Northern Natural, the Court held that the Act preempts\nstate regulations requiring pipelines to buy gas ratably\nfrom gas wells. 372 U. S., at 90. The regulations in that\ncase shared each of the principal features emphasized by\nthe Court today. They governed background market\n6               ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nconditions, not wholesale prices. Id., at 90–91. The back-\nground conditions in question, pipelines’ purchases from\ngas wells, affected both the federal field of wholesale sales\nand the state field of gas production. Id., at 92–93. And\nthe regulations took aim at the purchases’ effects on pro-\nduction; they sought to promote conservation of natural\nresources by limiting how much gas pipelines could take\nfrom each well. Id., at 93. No matter; the Court still\nconcluded that the regulations “invade[d] the federal\nagency’s exclusive domain.” Id., at 92. The factors that\nmade no difference in Northern Natural should make no\ndifference today.\n   Contrast Northern Natural with Northwest Central\nPipeline Corp. v. State Corporation Comm’n of Kan., 489\nU. S. 493 (1989), which involved state regulations that\nrestricted the times when producers could take gas from\nwells. On this occasion the Court upheld the regula-\ntions—not because the law aimed at the objective of gas\nconservation, but because the State pursued this end by\nregulating “ ‘the physical ac[t] of drawing gas from the\nearth.’ ” Id., at 510. Our precedents demand, in other\nwords, that the Court focus in the present case upon what\nthe State seeks to regulate (a pipeline practice that is\nsubject to regulation by the Commission), not why the\nState seeks to regulate it (to curb the practice’s effects on\nretail rates).\n   Trying to turn liabilities into assets, the Court bran-\ndishes statements from Northern Natural and Northwest\nCentral that (in its view) discuss where state law was\n“aimed” or “directed.” Ante, at 11. But read in context,\nthese statements refer to the entity or activity that the\nstate law regulates, not to which of the activity’s effects\nthe law seeks to control by regulating it. See, e.g., North-\nern Natural, supra, at 94 (“[O]ur cases have consistently\nrecognized a significant distinction . . . between conserva-\ntion measures aimed directly at interstate purchasers and\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwholesales . . . , and those aimed at producers and produc-\ntion”); Northwest Central, supra, at 512 (“[This regulation]\nis directed to the behavior of gas producers”). The law-\nsuits at hand target pipelines (entities regulated by the\nCommission) for their manipulation of indices (behavior\nregulated by the Commission). That should have sufficed\nto establish preemption.\n                               B\n   The Court also tallies several features of state antitrust\nlaw that, it believes, weigh against preemption. Ante, at\n13–14. Once again the Court seems to have forgotten its\nprecedents. We have said before that “ ‘Congress meant to\ndraw a bright line easily ascertained, between state and\nfederal jurisdiction’ ” over the gas trade. Nantahala Power\n& Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U. S. 953, 966 (1986) (quot-\ning FPC v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., 376 U. S. 205, 215–\n216 (1964)). Our decisions have therefore “ ‘squarely\nrejected’ ” the theory, endorsed by the Court today, that\nthe boundary between national and local authority turns\non “ ‘a case-by-case analysis of the impact of state regula-\ntion upon the national interest.’ ” Ibid.\n   State antitrust law, the Court begins, applies to “all\nbusinesses in the marketplace” rather than just “natural-\ngas companies in particular.” Ante, at 13. So what? No\nprinciple of our natural-gas preemption jurisprudence\ndistinguishes particularized state laws from state laws of\ngeneral applicability. We have never suggested, for exam-\nple, that a State may use general price-gouging laws to fix\nwholesale rates, or general laws about unfair trade prac-\ntices to control wholesale contracts, or general common-\ncarrier laws to administer interstate pipelines. The Court\nin any event could not have chosen a worse setting in\nwhich to attempt a distinction between general and par-\nticular laws. Like their federal counterpart, state anti-\ntrust laws tend to use the rule of reason to judge the law-\n8              ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfulness of challenged practices. Legal Aspects of Buying\nand Selling §10:12 (P. Zeidman ed. 2014–2015). This\namorphous standard requires the reviewing court to con-\nsider “a variety of factors, including specific information\nabout the relevant business, its condition before and after\nthe restraint was imposed, and the restraint’s history,\nnature, and effect.” State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 10\n(1997). Far from authorizing across-the-board application\nof a uniform requirement, therefore, the Court’s decision\nwill invite state antitrust courts to engage in targeted\nregulation of the natural-gas industry.\n   The Court also stresses the “ ‘long history’ ” of state\nantitrust regulation. Ante, at 14. Again, quite beside the\npoint. States have long regulated public utilities, yet the\nNatural Gas Act precludes them from using that estab-\nlished power to fix gas wholesale prices. United Fuel, 317\nU. S., at 468. States also have long enacted laws to con-\nserve natural resources, yet the Act precludes them from\ndeploying that power to control purchases made by gas\npipelines. Northern Natural, 372 U. S., at 93–94. The\nCourt’s invocation of the pedigree of state antitrust law\nrests on air.\n   One need not launch this unbounded inquiry into the\nfeatures of state law in order to preserve the States’ au-\nthority to apply “tax laws,” “disclosure laws,” and “blue\nsky laws” to natural-gas companies, ante, at 12. One need\nonly stand by the principle that if the Commission has\nauthority over a subject, the States lack authority over\nthat subject. The Commission’s authority to regulate gas\npipelines “in the public interest,” §717a, is a power to\naddress matters that are traditionally the concern of\nutility regulators, not “a broad license to promote the\ngeneral public welfare,” NAACP v. FPC, 425 U. S. 662, 669\n(1976). We have explained that the Commission does not,\nfor example, have power to superintend “employment\ndiscrimination” or “unfair labor practices.” Id., at 670–\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n671. So the Act does not preempt state employment dis-\ncrimination or labor laws. But the Commission does have\npower to consider, say, “conservation, environmental, and\nantitrust questions.” Id., at 670, n. 6 (emphasis added).\nSo the Act does preempt state antitrust laws.\n                              C\n   At bottom, the Court’s decision turns on its perception\nthat the Natural Gas Act “ ‘was drawn with meticulous\nregard for the continued exercise of state power.’ ” Ante, at\n10. No doubt the Act protects state authority in a variety\nof ways. It gives the Commission authority over only some\nparts of the gas trade. §717(b). It establishes procedures\nunder which the Commission may consult, collaborate, or\nshare information with States. §717p. It even provides\nthat the Commission may regulate practices affecting\nwholesale rates “upon its own motion or upon complaint of\nany State.” §717d(a) (emphasis added). It should have\ngone without saying, however, that no law pursues its\npurposes at all costs. Nothing in the Act and nothing in\nour cases suggests that Congress protected state power in\nthe way imagined by today’s decision: by licensing state\nsorties into the Commission’s domain whenever judges\nconclude that an incursion would not be too disruptive.\n   The Court’s preoccupation with the purpose of preserv-\ning state authority is all the more inexpiable because that\nis not the Act’s only purpose. The Act also has competing\npurposes, the most important of which is promoting “uni-\nformity of regulation.” Northern Natural, supra, at 91.\nThe Court’s decision impairs that objective. Before today,\ninterstate pipelines knew that their practices relating to\nprice indices had to comply with one set of regulations\npromulgated by the Commission. From now on, however,\npipelines will have to ensure that their behavior conforms\nto the discordant regulations of 50 States—or more accu-\nrately, to the discordant verdicts of untold state antitrust\n10             ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\njuries. The Court’s reassurance that pipelines may still\ninvoke conflict preemption, see ante, at 15–16, provides\nlittle comfort on this front. Conflict preemption will re-\nsolve only discrepancies between state and federal regula-\ntions, not the discrepancies among differing state regula-\ntions to which today’s opinion subjects the industry.\n                        *    *     *\n   “The Natural Gas Act was designed . . . to produce a\nharmonious and comprehensive regulation of the industry.\nNeither state nor federal regulatory body was to encroach\nupon the jurisdiction of the other.” FPC v. Panhandle\nEastern Pipe Line Co., 337 U. S. 498, 513 (1949) (footnote\nomitted). Today, however, the Court allows the States to\nencroach. Worse still, it leaves pipelines guessing about\nwhen States will be allowed to encroach again. May\nStates aim at retail rates under laws that share none of\nthe features of antitrust law advertised today? Under\nlaws that share only some of those features? May States\napply their antitrust laws to pipelines without aiming at\nretail rates? But that is just the start. Who knows what\nother “considerations that weigh against a finding of pre-\nemption” remain to be unearthed in future cases? The\nCourt’s all-things-considered test does not make for a\nstable background against which to carry on the natural\ngas trade.\n   I would stand by the more principled and more workable\nline traced by our precedents. The Commission may\nregulate the practices alleged in this case; the States\ntherefore may not. I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 2795279, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/04/21/oneok_inc._v._learjet_inc..pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2014                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 12, 2015—Decided April 21, 2015\nRespondents, a group of manufacturers, hospitals, and other institu-\n  tions that buy natural gas directly from interstate pipelines, sued pe-\n  titioner interstate pipelines, claiming that the pipelines had engaged\n  in behavior that violated state antitrust laws. In particular, re-\n  spondents alleged that petitioners reported false information to the\n  natural-gas indices on which respondents’ natural-gas contracts were\n  based. The indices affected not only retail natural-gas prices, but al-\n  so wholesale natural-gas prices.\n     After removing the cases to federal court, the petitioner pipelines\n  sought summary judgment on the ground that the Natural Gas Act\n  pre-empted respondents’ state-law claims. That Act gives the Feder-\n  al Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to determine\n  whether rates charged by natural-gas companies or practices affect-\n  ing such rates are unreasonable. 15 U. S. C. §717d(a). But it also\n  limits FERC’s jurisdiction to the transportation of natural gas in in-\n  terstate commerce, the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for\n  resale, and natural-gas companies engaged in such transportation or\n  sale. §717(b). The Act leaves regulation of other portions of the in-\n  dustry—such as retail sales—to the States. Ibid.\n     The District Court granted petitioners’ motion for summary judg-\n  ment, reasoning that because petitioners’ challenged practices direct-\n  ly affected wholesale as well as retail prices, they were pre-empted by\n  the Act. The Ninth Circuit reversed. While acknowledging that the\n  pipelines’ index manipulation increased wholesale prices as well as\n  retail prices, it held that the state-law claims were not pre-empted\n  because they were aimed at obtaining damages only for excessively\n  high retail prices.\nHeld: Respondents’ state-law antitrust claims are not within the field of\n2                    ONEOK, INC. v.

S. 507, 517–518. Where, as here, a\n    practice affects nonjurisdictional as well as jurisdictional sales, pre-\n    emption can be found only where a detailed examination convincingly\n    demonstrates that a matter falls within the pre-empted field as de-\n    fined by this Court’s precedents. Those precedents emphasize the\n    importance of considering the target at which the state-law claims\n    aim. See, e.g., Northern Natural Gas Co. v. State Corporation\n    Comm’n of Kan., 372 U. S. 84; Northwest Central Pipeline Corp. v.\n    State Corporation Comm’n of Kan., 489 U. S. 493. Here, respondents’\n    claims are aimed at practices affecting retail prices, a matter “firmly\n    on the States’ side of [the] dividing line.” Id., at 514.\n       Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U. S. 293, is not to the con-\n    trary. That opinion explains that the Act does not pre-empt “tradi-\n    tional” state regulation, such as blue sky laws. Id., at 308, n. 11. An-\n    titrust laws, like blue sky laws, are not aimed at natural-gas\n    companies in particular, but rather all businesses in the market-\n    place. The broad applicability of state antitrust laws supports a find-\n    ing of no pre-emption here.\n       So, too, does the fact that States have long provided “common-law\n    and statutory remedies against monopolies and unfair business prac-\n    tices,” California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U. S. 93, 101. As noted\n    earlier, the Act circumscribes FERC’s powers and preserves tradi-\n    tional areas of state authority. §717(b). Pp. 10–14.\n       (b) Neither Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel.\n    Moore, 487 U. S. 354, nor FPC v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 406\n    U. S. 621, supports petitioners’ position. Mississippi Power is best\n    read as a conflict pre-emption case, not a field pre-emption case. In\n    any event, the state inquiry in Mississippi Power was pre-empted be-\n    cause it was directed at jurisdictional sales in a way that respond-\n    ents’ state antitrust suits are not. Louisiana Power is also a conflict\n    pre-emption case, and thus does not significantly help petitioners’\n    field pre-emption argument. Pp. 14–15.\n       (c) Because the parties have not argued conflict pre-emption, ques-\n    tions involving conflicts between state antitrust proceedings and the\n    federal rate-setting process are left for the lower courts to resolve in\n    the first instance. Pp. 15–16.\n       (d) While petitioners and the Government argue that this Court\n    should defer to FERC’s determination that field pre-emption bars re-\n    spondents’ claims, they fail to point to a specific FERC determination\n    that state antitrust claims fall within the field pre-empted by the\n    Natural Gas Act.

The question is whether the\nfederal Natural Gas Act pre-empts these lawsuits. We\nhave said that, in passing the Act, “Congress occupied the\nfield of matters relating to wholesale sales and transporta­\ntion of natural gas in interstate commerce.” Schneidewind\nv. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U. S. 293, 305 (1988). Neverthe­\nless, for the reasons given below, we conclude that the Act\ndoes not pre-empt the state-law antitrust suits at issue\nhere.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The Supremacy Clause provides that “the Laws of the\nUnited States” (as well as treaties and the Constitution\nitself ) “shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any\n2                ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the\nContrary notwithstanding.” Art. VI, cl. 2. Congress may\nconsequently pre-empt, i.e., invalidate, a state law through\nfederal legislation. It may do so through express language\nin a statute. But even where, as here, a statute does not\nrefer expressly to pre-emption, Congress may implicitly\npre-empt a state law, rule, or other state action. See\nSprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 64 (2002).\n   It may do so either through “field” pre-emption or “con­\nflict” pre-emption. As to the former, Congress may have\nintended “to foreclose any state regulation in the area,”\nirrespective of whether state law is consistent or incon­\nsistent with “federal standards.” Arizona v. United States,\n567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 10) (emphasis added).\nIn such situations, Congress has forbidden the State to\ntake action in the field that the federal statute pre-empts.\n   By contrast, conflict pre-emption exists where “compli­\nance with both state and federal law is impossible,” or\nwhere “the state law ‘stands as an obstacle to the accom­\nplishment and execution of the full purposes and objec­\ntives of Congress.’ ” California v. ARC America Corp., 490\nU. S. 93, 100, 101 (1989). In either situation, federal law\nmust prevail.\n   No one here claims that any relevant federal statute\nexpressly pre-empts state antitrust lawsuits. Nor have\nthe parties argued at any length that these state suits\nconflict with federal law. Rather, the interstate pipeline\ncompanies (petitioners here) argue that Congress implic-\nitly “‘occupied the field of matters relating to wholesale sales\nand transportation of natural gas in interstate com­\nmerce.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 18 (quoting Schneidewind,\nsupra, at 305 (emphasis added)). And they contend that\nthe state antitrust claims advanced by their direct-sales\ncustomers (respondents here) fall within that field. The\nUnited States, supporting the pipelines, argues similarly.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15. Since\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 283 (1997). First, natural-gas\nproducers sunk wells in large oil and gas fields (such as\nthe Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico). They\ngathered the gas, brought it to transportation points, and\nleft it to interstate gas pipelines to transport the gas to\ndistant markets. Second, interstate pipelines shipped the\ngas from the field to cities and towns across the Nation.\nThird, local gas distributors bought the gas from the inter­\nstate pipelines and resold it to business and residential\ncustomers within their localities.\n   Originally, the States regulated all three segments of\nthe industry. See 1 Mogel §1.03. But in the early 20th\ncentury, this Court held that the Commerce Clause forbids\nthe States to regulate the second part of the business—i.e.,\nthe interstate shipment and sale of gas to local distribu­\ntors for resale. See, e.g., Public Util. Comm’n of R. I. v.\nAttleboro Steam & Elec. Co., 273 U. S. 83, 89–90 (1927);\nMissouri ex rel. Barrett v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 265\nU. S. 298, 307–308 (1924). These holdings left a regula-\ntory gap. Congress enacted the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat.\n821, to fill it. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, 347\nU. S. 672, 682–684, n. 13 (1954) (citing H. R. Rep. No. 709,\n75th Cong., 1st Sess., 1–2 (1937); S. Rep. No. 1162, 75th\nCong., 1st Sess., 1–2 (1937)).\n   The Act, in §5(a), gives rate-setting authority to the\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC, formerly\n4               ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Federal Power Commission (FPC)). That authority\nallows FERC to determine whether “any rate, charge, or\nclassification . . . collected by any natural-gas company in\nconnection with any transportation or sale of natural gas,\nsubject to the jurisdiction of [FERC],” or “any rule, regula­\ntion, practice, or contract affecting such rate, charge, or\nclassification is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discrimina­\ntory, or preferential.” 15 U. S. C. §717d(a) (emphasis\nadded). As the italicized words make clear, §5(a) limits\nthe scope of FERC’s authority to activities “in connection\nwith any transportation or sale of natural gas, subject to\nthe jurisdiction of the Commission.” Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). And the Act, in §1(b), limits FERC’s “jurisdiction” to\n(1) “the transportation of natural gas in interstate com­\nmerce,” (2) “the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas\nfor resale,” and (3) “natural-gas companies engaged in\nsuch transportation or sale.” §717(b). The Act leaves\nregulation of other portions of the industry—such as pro­\nduction, local distribution facilities, and direct sales—to\nthe States. See Northwest Central Pipeline Corp. v. State\nCorporation Comm’n of Kan., 489 U. S. 493, 507 (1989)\n(Section 1(b) of the Act “expressly” provides that “States\nretain jurisdiction over intrastate transportation, local\ndistribution, and distribution facilities, and over ‘the\nproduction or gathering of natural gas’ ”).\n   To simplify our discussion, we shall describe the firms\nthat engage in interstate transportation as “jurisdictional\nsellers” or “interstate pipelines” (though various brokers\nand others may also fall within the Act’s jurisdictional\nscope). Similarly, we shall refer to the sales over which\nFERC has jurisdiction as “jurisdictional sales” or “whole­\nsale sales.”\n                             2\n  Until the 1970’s, natural-gas regulation roughly tracked\nthe industry model we described above. Interstate pipe­\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlines would typically buy gas from field producers and\nresell it to local distribution companies for resale. See\nTracy, supra, at 283. FERC (or FPC), acting under the\nauthority of the Natural Gas Act, would set interstate\npipeline wholesale rates using classical “cost-of-service”\nratemaking methods. See Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y. v.\nMid-Louisiana Gas Co., 463 U. S. 319, 328 (1983). That\nis, FERC would determine a pipeline’s revenue require­\nment by calculating the costs of providing its services,\nincluding operating and maintenance expenses, deprecia­\ntion expenses, taxes, and a reasonable profit. See FERC,\nCost-of-Service Rates Manual 6 (June 1999). FERC would\nthen set wholesale rates at a level designed to meet the\npipeline’s revenue requirement.\n   Deregulation of the natural-gas industry, however,\nbrought about changes in FERC’s approach. In the 1950’s,\nthis Court had held that the Natural Gas Act required\nregulation of prices at the interstate pipelines’ buying\nend—i.e., the prices at which field producers sold natural\ngas to interstate pipelines. Phillips Petroleum Co., supra,\nat 682, 685. By the 1970’s, many in Congress thought that\nsuch efforts to regulate field prices had jeopardized\nnatural-gas supplies in an industry already dependent “on\nthe caprice of nature.” FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320\nU. S. 591, 630 (1944) (opinion of Jackson, J.); see id., at\n629 (recognizing that “the wealth of Midas and the wit of\nman cannot produce . . . a natural gas field”). Hoping to\navoid future shortages, Congress enacted forms of field\nprice deregulation designed to rely upon competition,\nrather than regulation, to keep field prices low. See, e.g.,\nNatural Gas Policy Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 3409, codified in\npart at 15 U. S. C. §3301 et seq. (phasing out regulation of\nwellhead prices charged by producers of natural gas);\nNatural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989, 103 Stat.\n157 (removing price controls on wellhead sales as of Janu­\nary 1993).\n6               ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   FERC promulgated new regulations designed to further\nthis process of deregulation. See, e.g., Regulation of Natu­\nral Gas Pipelines after Partial Wellhead Decontrol, 50\nFed. Reg. 42408 (1985) (allowing “open access” to pipelines\nso that consumers could pay to ship their own gas). Most\nimportant here, FERC adopted an approach that relied on\nthe competitive marketplace, rather than classical regula­\ntory rate-setting, as the main mechanism for keeping\nwholesale natural-gas rates at a reasonable level. Order\nNo. 636, issued in 1992, allowed FERC to issue blanket\ncertificates that permitted jurisdictional sellers (typically\ninterstate pipelines) to charge market-based rates for gas,\nprovided that FERC had first determined that the sellers\nlacked market power. See 57 Fed. Reg. 57957–57958\n(1992); id., at 13270.\n   After the issuance of this order, FERC’s oversight of the\nnatural-gas market largely consisted of (1) ex ante exami­\nnations of jurisdictional sellers’ market power, and (2) the\navailability of a complaint process under §717d(a). See\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4. The new\nsystem also led many large gas consumers—such as indus­\ntrial and commercial users—to buy their own gas directly\nfrom gas producers, and to arrange (and often pay sepa­\nrately) for transportation from the field to the place of\nconsumption. See Tracy, 519 U. S., at 284. Insofar as\ninterstate pipelines sold gas to such consumers, they sold\nit for direct consumption rather than resale.\n                             3\n   The free-market system for setting interstate pipeline\nrates turned out to be less than perfect. Interstate pipe­\nlines, distributing companies, and many of the customers\nwho bought directly from the pipelines found that they\nhad to rely on privately published price indices to deter­\nmine appropriate prices for their natural-gas contracts.\nThese indices listed the prices at which natural gas was\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbeing sold in different (presumably competitive) markets\nacross the country. The information on which these in-\ndices were based was voluntarily reported by natural-gas\ntraders.\n   In 2003, FERC found that the indices were inaccurate,\nin part because much of the information that natural-gas\ntraders reported had been false. See FERC, Final Report\non Price Manipulation in Western Markets (Mar. 2003),\nApp. 88–89. FERC found that false reporting had involved\n“inflating the volume of trades, omitting trades, and ad­\njusting the price of trades.” Id., at 88. That is, sometimes\nthose who reported information simply fabricated it.\nOther times, the information reported reflected “wash\ntrades,” i.e., “prearranged pair[s] of trades of the same\ngood between the same parties, involving no economic risk\nand no net change in beneficial ownership.” Id., at 215.\nFERC concluded that these “efforts to manipulate price\nindices compiled by trade publications” had helped raise\n“to extraordinary levels” the prices of both jurisdictional\nsales (that is, interstate pipeline sales for resale) and\nnonjurisdictional direct sales to ultimate consumers. Id.,\nat 86, 85.\n   After issuing its final report on price manipulation in\nwestern markets, FERC issued a Code of Conduct. That\ncode amended all blanket certificates to prohibit jurisdic­\ntional sellers “from engaging in actions without a legiti­\nmate business purpose that manipulate or attempt to\nmanipulate market conditions, including wash trades and\ncollusion.” 68 Fed. Reg. 66324 (2003). The code also\nrequired jurisdictional companies, when they provided\ninformation to natural-gas index publishers, to “provide\naccurate and factual information, and not knowingly\nsubmit false or misleading information or omit material\ninformation to any such publisher.” Id., at 66337. At the\nsame time, FERC issued a policy statement setting forth\n“minimum standards for creation and publication of any\n8               ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nenergy price index,” and “for reporting transaction data to\nindex developers.” Price Discovery in Natural Gas and\nElec. Markets, 104 FERC ¶61,121, pp. 61,407, 61,408\n(2003). Finally, FERC, after finding that certain jurisdic­\ntional sellers had “engaged in wash trading . . . that re­\nsulted in the manipulation of [natural-gas] prices,” termi­\nnated those sellers’ blanket marketing certificates. Enron\nPower Marketing, Inc., 103 FERC ¶61,343, p. 62,303\n(2003).\n   Congress also took steps to address these problems. In\nparticular, it passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, 119\nStat. 594, which gives FERC the authority to issue rules\nand regulations to prevent “any manipulative or deceptive\ndevice or contrivance” by “any entity . . . in connection\nwith the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or\nsale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction\nof ” FERC, 15 U. S. C. §717c–1.\n                              C\n  We now turn to the cases before us. Respondents, as we\nhave said, bought large quantities of natural gas directly\nfrom interstate pipelines for their own consumption. They\nbelieve that they overpaid in these transactions due to the\ninterstate pipelines’ manipulation of the natural-gas\nindices. Based on this belief, they filed state-law antitrust\nsuits against petitioners in state and federal courts. See\nApp. 244–246 (alleging violations of Wis. Stat. §§133.03,\n133.14, 133.18); see also App. 430–433 (same); id., at 519–\n521 (same); id., at 362–364 (alleging violations of Kansas\nRestraint of Trade Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. §50–101 et seq.);\nApp. 417–419 (alleging violations of Missouri Antitrust\nLaw, Mo. Rev. Stat. §§416.011–416.161). The pipelines\nremoved all the state cases to federal court, where they\nwere consolidated and sent for pretrial proceedings to the\nFederal District Court for the District of Nevada. See 28\nU. S. C. §1407.\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The pipelines then moved for summary judgment on the\nground that the Natural Gas Act pre-empted respondents’\nstate-law antitrust claims. The District Court granted\ntheir motion. It concluded that the pipelines were “juris­\ndictional sellers,” i.e., “natural gas companies engaged in”\nthe “transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.”\nOrder in No. 03–cv–1431 (D Nev., July 18, 2011), pp. 4, 11.\nAnd it held that respondents’ claims, which were “aimed\nat” these sellers’ “alleged practices of false price reporting,\nwash trades, and anticompetitive collusive behavior” were\npre-empted because “such practices,” not only affected\nnonjurisdictional direct-sale prices but also “directly af­\nfect[ed]” jurisdictional (i.e., wholesale) rates. Id., at 36–37.\n  The Ninth Circuit reversed. It emphasized that the\nprice-manipulation of which respondents complained\naffected not only jurisdictional (i.e., wholesale) sales, but\nalso nonjurisdictional (i.e., retail) sales. The court con­\nstrued the Natural Gas Act’s pre-emptive scope narrowly\nin light of Congress’ intent—manifested in §1(b) of the\nAct—to preserve for the States the authority to regulate\nnonjurisdictional sales. And it held that the Act did not\npre-empt state-law claims aimed at obtaining damages for\nexcessively high retail natural-gas prices stemming from\ninterstate pipelines’ price manipulation, even if the ma­\nnipulation raised wholesale rates as well. See In re West-\nern States Wholesale Natural Gas Antitrust Litigation, 715\nF. 3d 716, 729–736 (2013).\n  The pipelines sought certiorari. They asked us to re­\nsolve confusion in the lower courts as to whether the\nNatural Gas Act pre-empts retail customers’ state anti­\ntrust law challenges to practices that also affect wholesale\nrates. Compare id., at 729–736, with Leggett v. Duke\nEnergy Corp., 308 S. W. 3d 843 (Tenn. 2010). We granted\nthe petition.\n10              ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             II\n   Petitioners, supported by the United States, argue that\ntheir customers’ state antitrust lawsuits are within the\nfield that the Natural Gas Act pre-empts. See Brief for\nPetitioners 18 (citing Schneidewind, 485 U. S., at 305);\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13 (same). They\npoint out that respondents’ antitrust claims target anti­\ncompetitive activities that affected wholesale (as well as\nretail) rates. See Brief for Petitioners 2. They add that\nthe Natural Gas Act expressly grants FERC authority to\nkeep wholesale rates at reasonable levels. See ibid. (citing\n15 U. S. C. §§717(b), 717d(a)). In exercising this authority,\nFERC has prohibited the very kind of anticompetitive\nconduct that the state actions attack. See Part I–B–3,\nsupra. And, petitioners contend, letting these actions\nproceed will permit state antitrust courts to reach conclu­\nsions about that conduct that differ from those that FERC\nmight reach or has already reached. Accordingly, peti­\ntioners argue, respondents’ state-law antitrust suits fall\nwithin the pre-empted field.\n                              A\n   Petitioners’ arguments are forceful, but we cannot ac­\ncept their conclusion. As we have repeatedly stressed, the\nNatural Gas Act “was drawn with meticulous regard for\nthe continued exercise of state power, not to handicap or\ndilute it in any way.” Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v.\nPublic Serv. Comm’n of Ind., 332 U. S. 507, 517–518\n(1947); see also Northwest Central, 489 U. S., at 511 (the\n“legislative history of the [Act] is replete with assurances\nthat the Act ‘takes nothing from the State [regulatory]\ncommissions’ ” (quoting 81 Cong. Rec. 6721 (1937))). Ac­\ncordingly, where (as here) a state law can be applied to\nnonjurisdictional as well as jurisdictional sales, we must\nproceed cautiously, finding pre-emption only where de­\ntailed examination convinces us that a matter falls within\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe pre-empted field as defined by our precedents. See\nPanhandle Eastern, supra, at 516–518; Interstate Natural\nGas Co. v. FPC, 331 U. S. 682, 689–693 (1947).\n   Those precedents emphasize the importance of consider­\ning the target at which the state law aims in determining\nwhether that law is pre-empted. For example, in Northern\nNatural Gas Co. v. State Corporation Comm’n of Kan., 372\nU. S. 84 (1963), the Court said that it had “consistently\nrecognized” that the “significant distinction” for purposes\nof pre-emption in the natural-gas context is the distinction\nbetween “measures aimed directly at interstate purchasers\nand wholesales for resale, and those aimed at” subjects left\nto the States to regulate. Id., at 94 (emphasis added).\nAnd, in Northwest Central, the Court found that the Natu­\nral Gas Act did not pre-empt a state regulation concerning\nthe timing of gas production from a gas field within the\nState, even though the regulation might have affected the\ncosts of and the prices of interstate wholesale sales, i.e.,\njurisdictional sales. 489 U. S., at 514. In reaching this\nconclusion, the Court explained that the state regulation\naimed primarily at “protect[ing] producers’ . . . rights—a\nmatter firmly on the States’ side of that dividing line.”\nIbid. The Court contrasted this state regulation with the\nstate orders at issue in Northern Natural, which “ ‘inva-\nlidly invade[d] the federal agency’s exclusive domain’ pre-\ncisely because” they were “‘unmistakably and unambiguously\ndirected at purchasers.’ ” Id., at 513 (quoting Northern\nNatural, supra, at 92; emphasis added). Here, too, the\nlawsuits are directed at practices affecting retail rates–\nwhich are “firmly on the States’ side of that dividing line.”\n   Petitioners argue that Schneidewind constitutes con-\ntrary authority. In that case, the Court found pre-empted a\nstate law that required public utilities, such as interstate\npipelines crossing the State, to obtain state approval\nbefore issuing long-term securities. 485 U. S., at 306–309.\nBut the Court there thought that the State’s securities\n12              ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nregulation was aimed directly at interstate pipelines. It\nwrote that the state law was designed to keep “a natural\ngas company from raising its equity levels above a certain\npoint” in order to keep the company’s revenue requirement\nlow, thereby ensuring lower wholesale rates. Id., at 307–\n308. Indeed, the Court expressly said that the state law\nwas pre-empted because it was “directed at . . . the control\nof rates and facilities of natural gas companies,” “precisely\nthe things over which FERC has comprehensive author-\nity.” Id., at 308 (emphasis added).\n   The dissent rejects the notion that the proper test for\npurposes of pre-emption in the natural gas context is\nwhether the challenged measures are “aimed directly at\ninterstate purchasers and wholesales for resale” or not.\nNorthern Natural, supra, at 94. It argues that this ap­\nproach is “unprecedented,” and that the Court’s focus\nshould be on “what the State seeks to regulate . . . , not\nwhy the State seeks to regulate it.” Post, at 6 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.). But the “target” to which our cases refer must\nmean more than just the physical activity that a State\nregulates. After all, a single physical action, such as\nreporting a price to a specialized journal, could be the\nsubject of many different laws—including tax laws, disclo­\nsure laws, and others. To repeat the point we made above,\nno one could claim that FERC’s regulation of this physical\nactivity for purposes of wholesale rates forecloses every\nother form of state regulation that affects those rates.\n   Indeed, although the dissent argues that Schneidwind\ncreated a definitive test for pre-emption in the natural gas\ncontext that turns on whether “the matter on which the\nState asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by\nthe Federal Act,” post, at 3 (quoting 485 U. S., at 310,\nn. 13), Schneidewind could not mean this statement as an\nabsolute test. It goes on to explain that the Natural Gas\nAct does not pre-empt “traditional” state regulation, such\nas state blue sky laws (which, of course, raise wholesale—\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nas well as retail—investment costs). Id., at 308, n. 11.\n    Antitrust laws, like blue sky laws, are not aimed at\nnatural-gas companies in particular, but rather all busi­\nnesses in the marketplace. See ibid. They are far broader\nin their application than, for example, the regulations at\nissue in Northern Natural, which applied only to entities\nbuying gas from fields within the State. See 372 U. S., at\n85–86, n. 1; contra, post, at 5–6 (stating that Northern\nNatural concerned “background market conditions”). This\nbroad applicability of state antitrust law supports a find­\ning of no pre-emption here.\n    Petitioners and the dissent argue that there is, or\nshould be, a clear division between areas of state and\nfederal authority in natural-gas regulation. See Brief for\nPetitioners 18; post, at 7. But that Platonic ideal does not\ndescribe the natural gas regulatory world.          Suppose\nFERC, when setting wholesale rates in the former cost-of­\nservice rate-making days, had denied cost recovery for\npipelines’ failure to recycle. Would that fact deny States\nthe power to enact and apply recycling laws? These state\nlaws might well raise pipelines’ operating costs, and thus\nthe costs of wholesale natural gas transportation. But in\nNorthwest Central we said that “[t]o find field pre-emption\nof [state] regulation merely because purchasers’ costs and\nhence rates might be affected would be largely to nullify\n. . . §1(b).” 489 U. S., at 514.\n    The dissent barely mentions the limitations on FERC’s\npowers in §1(b), but the enumeration of FERC’s powers in\n§5(a) is circumscribed by a reference back to the limita­\ntions in §1(b). See post, at 1–3. As we explained above,\nsee Part I–B–1, supra, those limits are key to understand­\ning the careful balance between federal and state regula­\ntion that Congress struck when it passed the Natural Gas\nAct. That Act “was drawn with meticulous regard for the\ncontinued exercise of state power, not to handicap or\ndilute it in any way.” Panhandle Eastern, 332 U. S., at\n14              ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n517–518. Contra, post, at 8. States have a “long history\nof ” providing “common-law and statutory remedies\nagainst monopolies and unfair business practices.” ARC\nAmerica, 490 U. S., at 101; see also Watson v. Buck, 313\nU. S. 387, 404 (1941) (noting the States’ “long-recognized\npower to regulate combinations in restraint of trade”).\nRespondents’ state-law antitrust suits relied on this well\nestablished state power.\n                              B\n  Petitioners point to two other cases that they believe\nsupport their position. The first is Mississippi Power &\nLight Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U. S. 354 (1988).\nThere, the Court held that the Federal Power Act—which\ngives FERC the authority to determine whether rates\ncharged by public utilities in electric energy sales are “just\nand reasonable,” 16 U. S. C. §824d(a)—pre-empted a state\ninquiry into the reasonableness of FERC-approved prices\nfor the sale of nuclear power to wholesalers of electricity\n(which led to higher retail electricity rates). 487 U. S., at\n373–377. Petitioners argue that this case shows that state\nregulation of similar sales here—i.e., by a pipeline to a\ndirect consumer—must also be pre-empted. See Reply\nBrief 11–12. Mississippi Power, however, is best read as a\nconflict pre-emption case, not a field pre-emption case.\nSee 487 U. S., at 377 (“[A] state agency’s ‘efforts to regu­\nlate commerce must fall when they conflict with or inter­\nfere with federal authority over the same activity’ ” (quot­\ning Chicago & North Western Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick &\nTile Co., 450 U. S. 311, 318–319 (1981))).\n  Regardless, the state inquiry in Mississippi Power was\npre-empted because it was directed at jurisdictional sales\nin a way that respondents’ state antitrust lawsuits are\nnot. Mississippi’s inquiry into the reasonableness of\nFERC-approved purchases was effectively an attempt to\n“regulate in areas where FERC has properly exercised its\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdiction to determine just and reasonable wholesale\nrates.” 487 U. S., at 374. By contrast, respondents’ state\nantitrust lawsuits do not seek to challenge the reason-\nableness of any rates expressly approved by FERC. Rather,\nthey seek to challenge the background marketplace condi­\ntions that affected both jurisdictional and nonjurisdic-\ntional rates.\n   Petitioners additionally point to FPC v. Louisiana Power\n& Light Co., 406 U. S. 621 (1972). In that case, the Court\nheld that federal law gave FPC the authority to allocate\nnatural gas during shortages by ordering interstate pipe­\nlines to curtail gas deliveries to all customers, including\nretail customers. This latter fact, the pipelines argue,\nshows that FERC has authority to regulate index manipu­\nlation insofar as that manipulation affects retail (as well\nas wholesale) sales. Brief for Petitioners 26. Accordingly,\nthey contend that state laws that aim at this same subject\nare pre-empted.\n   This argument, however, makes too much of too little.\nThe Court’s finding of pre-emption in Louisiana Power\nrested on its belief that the state laws in question con-\nflicted with federal law. The Court concluded that “FPC\nhas authority to effect orderly curtailment plans involving\nboth direct sales and sales for resale,” 406 U. S., at 631,\nbecause otherwise there would be “unavoidable conflict\nbetween” state regulation of direct sales and the “uniform\nfederal regulation” that the Natural Gas Act foresees, id.,\nat 633–635.

But they have not pointed to\na specific FERC determination that state antitrust claims\nfall within the field pre-empted by the Natural Gas Act.\nRather, they point only to the fact that FERC has promul­\ngated detailed rules governing manipulation of price\nindices. Because there is no determination by FERC that\nits regulation pre-empts the field into which respondents’\nstate-law antitrust suits fall, we need not consider what\nlegal effect such a determination might have.

I write separately to reiterate my view that “implied\npre-emption doctrines that wander far from the statutory\ntext are inconsistent with the Constitution.” Wyeth v.\nLevine, 555 U. S. 555, 583 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring\nin judgment). The Supremacy Clause of our Constitution\n“gives ‘supreme’ status only to those [federal laws] that\nare ‘made in Pursuance’ ” of it. Id., at 585 (quoting Art. VI,\ncl. 2). And to be “made in Pursuance” of the Constitution,\na law must fall within one of Congress’ enumerated pow-\ners and be promulgated in accordance with the lawmaking\nprocedures set forth in that document. Id., at 585–586.\n“The Supremacy Clause thus requires that pre-emptive\neffect be given only to those federal standards and policies\nthat are set forth in, or necessarily follow from, the statu-\ntory text that was produced through the constitutionally\nrequired bicameral and presentment procedures.” Id., at\n586.\n   In light of this constitutional requirement, I have doubts\nabout the legitimacy of this Court’s precedents concern-\ning the pre-emptive scope of the Natural Gas Act, see, e.g.,\nNorthern Natural Gas Co. v.

The Act\nand our cases interpreting it draw a firm line between\nnational and local authority over this trade: If the Federal\nGovernment may regulate a subject, the States may not.\nToday the Court smudges this line. It holds that States\nmay use their antitrust laws to regulate practices already\nregulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\nwhenever “other considerations . . . weigh against a find-\ning of pre-emption.” Ante, at 16. The Court’s make-it-up-\nas-you-go-along approach to preemption has no basis in\nthe Act, contradicts our cases, and will prove unworkable\nin practice.\n                              I\n  Trade in natural gas consists of three parts. A drilling\ncompany collects gas from the earth; a pipeline company\nthen carries the gas to its destination and sells it at\nwholesale to a local distributor; and the local distributor\nsells the gas at retail to industries and households. See\nante, at 3. The Natural Gas Act empowers the Commis-\nsion to regulate the middle of this three-leg journey—\ninterstate transportation and wholesale sales. 15 U. S. C.\n2              ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n§717 et seq. But it does not empower the Commission to\nregulate the opening and closing phases—production at\none end, retail sales at the other—thus leaving those\nmatters to the States. §717(b). (Like the Court, I will for\nsimplicity’s sake call the sales controlled by the Commis-\nsion wholesale sales, and the companies controlled by the\nCommission pipelines. See ante, at 4.)\n   Over 70 years ago, the Court concluded that the Act\nconfers “exclusive jurisdiction upon the federal regulatory\nagency.” Public Util. Comm’n of Ohio v. United Fuel Gas\nCo., 317 U. S. 456, 469 (1943). The Court thought it\n“clear” that the Act contemplates “a harmonious, dual\nsystem of regulation of the natural gas industry—federal\nand state regulatory bodies operating side by side, each\nactive in its own sphere,” “without any confusion of func-\ntions.” Id., at 467. The Court drew this inference from the\nlaw’s purpose and legislative history, though it could just\nas easily have relied on the law’s terms and structure.\nThe Act grants the Commission a wide range of powers\nover wholesale sales and transportation, but qualifies only\nsome of these powers with reservations of state authority\nover the same subject. See §717g(a) (concurrent authority\nover recordkeeping); §717h(a) (concurrent authority over\ndepreciation and amortization rates). Congress’s decision\nto include express reservations of state power alongside\nthese grants of authority, but to omit them alongside other\ngrants of authority, suggests that the other grants are\nexclusive. Right or wrong, in any event, our inference of\nexclusivity is now settled beyond debate.\n   United Fuel rejected a State’s regulation of wholesale\nrates. Id., at 468. But our later holdings establish that\nthe Act makes exclusive the Commission’s powers in\ngeneral, not just its rate-setting power in particular. We\nhave again and again set aside state laws—even those\nthat do not purport to fix wholesale rates—for regulating a\nmatter already subject to regulation by the Commission.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nSee, e.g., Northern Natural Gas Co. v. State Corporation\nComm’n of Kan., 372 U. S. 84, 89 (1963) (state regulation\nof pipelines’ gas purchases preempted because it “in-\nvade[s] the exclusive jurisdiction which the Natural Gas\nAct has conferred upon the [Commission]”); Exxon Corp. v.\nEagerton, 462 U. S. 176, 185 (1983) (state law prohibiting\nproducers from passing on production taxes preempted\nbecause it “trespasse[s] upon FERC’s authority”);\nSchneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U. S. 293, 309\n(1988) (state securities regulation directly affecting whole-\nsale rates and gas transportation facilities preempted\nbecause it regulates “matters that Congress intended\nFERC to regulate”). The test for preemption in this set-\nting, the Court has confirmed, “ ‘is whether the matter on\nwhich the State asserts the right to act is in any way\nregulated by the Federal Act.’ ” Id., at 310, n. 13.\n  Straightforward application of these precedents would\nmake short work of the case at hand. The Natural Gas\nAct empowers the Commission to regulate “practice[s] . . .\naffecting [wholesale] rate[s].” §717d. Nothing in the Act\nsuggests that the States share power to regulate these\npractices. The Commission has reasonably determined\nthat this power allows it to regulate the behavior involved\nin this case, pipelines’ use of sham trades and false reports\nto manipulate gas price indices. Because the Commis-\nsion’s exclusive authority extends to the conduct chal-\nlenged here, state antitrust regulation of that conduct is\npreempted.\n                            II\n   The Court agrees that the Commission may regulate\nindex manipulation, but upholds state antitrust regulation\nof this practice anyway on account of “other considerations\nthat weigh against a finding of pre-emption in this con-\ntext.” Ante, at 16. That is an unprecedented decision.\nThe Court does not identify a single case—not one—in\n4               ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwhich we have sustained state regulation of behavior\nalready regulated by the Commission. The Court’s justifi-\ncations for its novel approach do not persuade.\n                               A\n   The Court begins by considering “the target at which the\nstate law aims.” Ante, at 11. It reasons that because this\ncase involves a practice that affects both wholesale and\nretail rates, the Act tolerates state regulation that takes\naim at the practice’s retail-stage effects. Ibid.\n   This analysis misunderstands how the Natural Gas Act\ndivides responsibilities between national and local regula-\ntors. The Act does not give the Commission the power to\naim at particular effects; it gives it the power to regulate\nparticular activities. When the Commission regulates\nthose activities, it may consider their effects on all parts of\nthe gas trade, not just on wholesale sales. It may, for\nexample, set wholesale rates with the aim of encouraging\nproducers to conserve gas supplies—even though produc-\ntion is a state-regulated activity. See Colorado Interstate\nGas Co. v. FPC, 324 U. S. 581, 602–603 (1945); id., at 609–\n610 (Jackson, J., concurring). Or it may regulate whole-\nsale sales with an eye toward blunting the sales’ anticom-\npetitive effects in the retail market—even though retail\nprices are controlled by the States. See FPC v. Conway\nCorp., 426 U. S. 271, 276–280 (1976). The Court’s ad hoc\npartition of authority over index manipulation—leaving it\nto the Commission to control the practice’s consequences\nfor wholesale sales, but allowing the States to target its\nconsequences for retail sales—thus clashes with the de-\nsign of the Act.\n   To justify its fixation on aims, the Court stresses that\nthis case involves regulation of “background marketplace\nconditions” rather than regulation of wholesale rates or\nsales themselves. Ante, at 15. But the Natural Gas Act\nempowers the Commission to regulate wholesale rates and\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)              5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n“background” practices affecting such rates. It grants both\npowers in the same clause: “Whenever the Commission . . .\nfind[s] that a [wholesale] rate, charge, or classification . . .\n[or] any rule, regulation, practice, or contract affecting\nsuch rate, charge, or classification is unjust [or] unreason-\nable, . . . the Commission shall determine the just and\nreasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation,\npractice, or contract to be thereafter observed.” §717d(a)\n(emphasis added). Nothing in this provision, and for that\nmatter nothing in the Act, suggests that federal authority\nover practices is a second-class power, somehow less ex-\nclusive than the authority over rates.\n   The Court persists that the background conditions in\nthis case affect both wholesale and retail sales. Ante, at\n15. This observation adds atmosphere, but nothing more.\nThe Court concedes that index manipulation’s dual effect\ndoes not weaken the Commission’s power to regulate it.\nAnte, at 10. So too should the Court have seen that this\nsimultaneous effect does not strengthen the claims of the\nStates. It is not at all unusual for an activity controlled by\nthe Commission to have effects in the States’ field; produc-\ntion, wholesale, and retail are after all interdependent\nstages of a single trade. We have never suggested that the\nrules of field preemption change in such situations. For\nexample, producers’ ability to pass production taxes on to\npipelines no doubt affects both producers and pipelines.\nYet we had no trouble concluding that a state law restrict-\ning producers’ ability to pass these taxes impermissibly\nattempted to manage “a matter within the sphere of\nFERC’s regulatory authority.” Exxon, supra, at 185–186.\n   The Court’s approach makes a snarl of our precedents.\nIn Northern Natural, the Court held that the Act preempts\nstate regulations requiring pipelines to buy gas ratably\nfrom gas wells. 372 U. S., at 90. The regulations in that\ncase shared each of the principal features emphasized by\nthe Court today. They governed background market\n6               ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nconditions, not wholesale prices. Id., at 90–91. The back-\nground conditions in question, pipelines’ purchases from\ngas wells, affected both the federal field of wholesale sales\nand the state field of gas production. Id., at 92–93. And\nthe regulations took aim at the purchases’ effects on pro-\nduction; they sought to promote conservation of natural\nresources by limiting how much gas pipelines could take\nfrom each well. Id., at 93. No matter; the Court still\nconcluded that the regulations “invade[d] the federal\nagency’s exclusive domain.” Id., at 92. The factors that\nmade no difference in Northern Natural should make no\ndifference today.\n   Contrast Northern Natural with Northwest Central\nPipeline Corp. v. State Corporation Comm’n of Kan., 489\nU. S. 493 (1989), which involved state regulations that\nrestricted the times when producers could take gas from\nwells. On this occasion the Court upheld the regula-\ntions—not because the law aimed at the objective of gas\nconservation, but because the State pursued this end by\nregulating “ ‘the physical ac[t] of drawing gas from the\nearth.’ ” Id., at 510. Our precedents demand, in other\nwords, that the Court focus in the present case upon what\nthe State seeks to regulate (a pipeline practice that is\nsubject to regulation by the Commission), not why the\nState seeks to regulate it (to curb the practice’s effects on\nretail rates).\n   Trying to turn liabilities into assets, the Court bran-\ndishes statements from Northern Natural and Northwest\nCentral that (in its view) discuss where state law was\n“aimed” or “directed.” Ante, at 11. But read in context,\nthese statements refer to the entity or activity that the\nstate law regulates, not to which of the activity’s effects\nthe law seeks to control by regulating it. See, e.g., North-\nern Natural, supra, at 94 (“[O]ur cases have consistently\nrecognized a significant distinction . . . between conserva-\ntion measures aimed directly at interstate purchasers and\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwholesales . . . , and those aimed at producers and produc-\ntion”); Northwest Central, supra, at 512 (“[This regulation]\nis directed to the behavior of gas producers”). The law-\nsuits at hand target pipelines (entities regulated by the\nCommission) for their manipulation of indices (behavior\nregulated by the Commission). That should have sufficed\nto establish preemption.\n                               B\n   The Court also tallies several features of state antitrust\nlaw that, it believes, weigh against preemption. Ante, at\n13–14. Once again the Court seems to have forgotten its\nprecedents. We have said before that “ ‘Congress meant to\ndraw a bright line easily ascertained, between state and\nfederal jurisdiction’ ” over the gas trade. Nantahala Power\n& Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U. S. 953, 966 (1986) (quot-\ning FPC v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., 376 U. S. 205, 215–\n216 (1964)). Our decisions have therefore “ ‘squarely\nrejected’ ” the theory, endorsed by the Court today, that\nthe boundary between national and local authority turns\non “ ‘a case-by-case analysis of the impact of state regula-\ntion upon the national interest.’ ” Ibid.\n   State antitrust law, the Court begins, applies to “all\nbusinesses in the marketplace” rather than just “natural-\ngas companies in particular.” Ante, at 13. So what? No\nprinciple of our natural-gas preemption jurisprudence\ndistinguishes particularized state laws from state laws of\ngeneral applicability. We have never suggested, for exam-\nple, that a State may use general price-gouging laws to fix\nwholesale rates, or general laws about unfair trade prac-\ntices to control wholesale contracts, or general common-\ncarrier laws to administer interstate pipelines. The Court\nin any event could not have chosen a worse setting in\nwhich to attempt a distinction between general and par-\nticular laws. Like their federal counterpart, state anti-\ntrust laws tend to use the rule of reason to judge the law-\n8              ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfulness of challenged practices. Legal Aspects of Buying\nand Selling §10:12 (P. Zeidman ed. 2014–2015). This\namorphous standard requires the reviewing court to con-\nsider “a variety of factors, including specific information\nabout the relevant business, its condition before and after\nthe restraint was imposed, and the restraint’s history,\nnature, and effect.” State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 10\n(1997). Far from authorizing across-the-board application\nof a uniform requirement, therefore, the Court’s decision\nwill invite state antitrust courts to engage in targeted\nregulation of the natural-gas industry.\n   The Court also stresses the “ ‘long history’ ” of state\nantitrust regulation. Ante, at 14. Again, quite beside the\npoint. States have long regulated public utilities, yet the\nNatural Gas Act precludes them from using that estab-\nlished power to fix gas wholesale prices. United Fuel, 317\nU. S., at 468. States also have long enacted laws to con-\nserve natural resources, yet the Act precludes them from\ndeploying that power to control purchases made by gas\npipelines. Northern Natural, 372 U. S., at 93–94. The\nCourt’s invocation of the pedigree of state antitrust law\nrests on air.\n   One need not launch this unbounded inquiry into the\nfeatures of state law in order to preserve the States’ au-\nthority to apply “tax laws,” “disclosure laws,” and “blue\nsky laws” to natural-gas companies, ante, at 12. One need\nonly stand by the principle that if the Commission has\nauthority over a subject, the States lack authority over\nthat subject. The Commission’s authority to regulate gas\npipelines “in the public interest,” §717a, is a power to\naddress matters that are traditionally the concern of\nutility regulators, not “a broad license to promote the\ngeneral public welfare,” NAACP v. FPC, 425 U. S. 662, 669\n(1976). We have explained that the Commission does not,\nfor example, have power to superintend “employment\ndiscrimination” or “unfair labor practices.” Id., at 670–\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n671. So the Act does not preempt state employment dis-\ncrimination or labor laws. But the Commission does have\npower to consider, say, “conservation, environmental, and\nantitrust questions.” Id., at 670, n. 6 (emphasis added).\nSo the Act does preempt state antitrust laws.\n                              C\n   At bottom, the Court’s decision turns on its perception\nthat the Natural Gas Act “ ‘was drawn with meticulous\nregard for the continued exercise of state power.’ ” Ante, at\n10. No doubt the Act protects state authority in a variety\nof ways. It gives the Commission authority over only some\nparts of the gas trade. §717(b). It establishes procedures\nunder which the Commission may consult, collaborate, or\nshare information with States. §717p. It even provides\nthat the Commission may regulate practices affecting\nwholesale rates “upon its own motion or upon complaint of\nany State.” §717d(a) (emphasis added). It should have\ngone without saying, however, that no law pursues its\npurposes at all costs. Nothing in the Act and nothing in\nour cases suggests that Congress protected state power in\nthe way imagined by today’s decision: by licensing state\nsorties into the Commission’s domain whenever judges\nconclude that an incursion would not be too disruptive.\n   The Court’s preoccupation with the purpose of preserv-\ning state authority is all the more inexpiable because that\nis not the Act’s only purpose. The Act also has competing\npurposes, the most important of which is promoting “uni-\nformity of regulation.” Northern Natural, supra, at 91.\nThe Court’s decision impairs that objective. Before today,\ninterstate pipelines knew that their practices relating to\nprice indices had to comply with one set of regulations\npromulgated by the Commission. From now on, however,\npipelines will have to ensure that their behavior conforms\nto the discordant regulations of 50 States—or more accu-\nrately, to the discordant verdicts of untold state antitrust\n10             ONEOK, INC. v. LEARJET, INC.\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\njuries. The Court’s reassurance that pipelines may still\ninvoke conflict preemption, see ante, at 15–16, provides\nlittle comfort on this front. Conflict preemption will re-\nsolve only discrepancies between state and federal regula-\ntions, not the discrepancies among differing state regula-\ntions to which today’s opinion subjects the industry.\n                        *    *     *\n   “The Natural Gas Act was designed . . . to produce a\nharmonious and comprehensive regulation of the industry.\nNeither state nor federal regulatory body was to encroach\nupon the jurisdiction of the other.” FPC v. Panhandle\nEastern Pipe Line Co., 337 U. S. 498, 513 (1949) (footnote\nomitted). Today, however, the Court allows the States to\nencroach. Worse still, it leaves pipelines guessing about\nwhen States will be allowed to encroach again. May\nStates aim at retail rates under laws that share none of\nthe features of antitrust law advertised today? Under\nlaws that share only some of those features? May States\napply their antitrust laws to pipelines without aiming at\nretail rates? But that is just the start. Who knows what\nother “considerations that weigh against a finding of pre-\nemption” remain to be unearthed in future cases? The\nCourt’s all-things-considered test does not make for a\nstable background against which to carry on the natural\ngas trade.\n   I would stand by the more principled and more workable\nline traced by our precedents. The Commission may\nregulate the practices alleged in this case; the States\ntherefore may not.
