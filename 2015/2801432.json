VIEGELAHN, CHAPTER 13 TRUSTEE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n        No. 14–400.      Argued April 1, 2015—Decided May 18, 2015\nIndividual debtors may seek discharge of their financial obligations\n  under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. In a\n  Chapter 7 proceeding, the debtor’s assets are transferred to a bank-\n  ruptcy estate. 11 U. S. C. §541(a)(1). The estate’s assets are then\n  promptly liquidated, §704(a)(1), and distributed to creditors, §726. A\n  Chapter 7 estate, however, does not include the wages a debtor earns\n  or the assets he acquires after the bankruptcy filing. §541(a)(1).\n  Chapter 13, a wholly voluntary alternative to Chapter 7, permits the\n  debtor to retain assets during bankruptcy subject to a court-approved\n  plan for payment of his debts. Payments under a Chapter 13 plan\n  are usually made from a debtor’s “future income.” 1322(a)(1). The\n  Chapter 13 estate, unlike a Chapter 7 estate, therefore includes both\n  the debtor’s property at the time of his bankruptcy petition, and any\n  assets he acquires after filing. §1306(a). Because many debtors fail to\n  complete a Chapter 13 plan successfully, Congress accorded debtors a\n  nonwaivable right to convert a Chapter 13 case to one under Chapter\n  7 “at any time.” §1307(a). Conversion does not commence a new\n  bankruptcy case, but it does terminate the service of the Chapter 13\n  trustee. §348(e).\n    Petitioner Harris, indebted to multiple creditors and $3,700 behind\n  on his home mortgage payments to Chase Manhattan, filed a Chap-\n  ter 13 bankruptcy petition. His court-confirmed plan provided that\n  he would resume making monthly mortgage payments to Chase, and\n  that $530 per month would be withheld from his postpetition wages\n  and remitted to the Chapter 13 trustee, respondent Viegelahn. Trus-\n  tee Viegelahn would make monthly payments to Chase to pay down\n  Harris’ mortgage arrears, and distribute remaining funds to Harris’\n  other creditors. When Harris again fell behind on his mortgage pay-\n2                        HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ments, Chase foreclosed on his home. Following the foreclosure, Vie-\n    gelahn continued to receive $530 per month from Harris’ wages, but\n    stopped making the payments earmarked for Chase. As a result,\n    funds formerly reserved for Chase accumulated in Viegelahn’s pos-\n    session. Approximately a year after the foreclosure, Harris converted\n    his case to Chapter 7. Ten days after this conversion, Viegelahn dis-\n    tributed $5,519.22 in Harris’ withheld wages mainly to Harris’ credi-\n    tors. Asserting that Viegelahn lacked authority to disburse his post-\n    petition wages to creditors postconversion, Harris sought an order\n    from the Bankruptcy Court directing refund of the accumulated wag-\n    es Viegelahn paid to his creditors. The Bankruptcy Court granted\n    Harris’ motion, and the District Court affirmed. The Fifth Circuit re-\n    versed, concluding that a former Chapter 13 trustee must distribute\n    a debtor’s accumulated postpetition wages to his creditors.\nHeld: A debtor who converts to Chapter 7 is entitled to return of any\n postpetition wages not yet distributed by the Chapter 13 trustee.\n Pp. 5–11.\n    (a) Absent a bad-faith conversion, §348(f) limits a converted Chap-\n ter 7 estate to property belonging to the debtor “as of the date” the\n original Chapter 13 petition was filed. Because postpetition wages do\n not fit that bill, undistributed wages collected by a Chapter 13 trus-\n tee ordinarily do not become part of a converted Chapter 7 estate.\n Pp. 5–6.\n    (b) By excluding postpetition wages from the converted Chapter 7\n estate (absent a bad-faith conversion), §348(f) removes those earnings\n from the pool of assets that may be liquidated and distributed to\n creditors. Allowing a terminated Chapter 13 trustee to disburse the\n very same earnings to the very same creditors is incompatible with\n that statutory design. Pp. 7–8.\n    (c) This conclusion is reinforced by §348(e), which “terminates the\n service of [the Chapter 13] trustee” upon conversion. One service\n provided by a Chapter 13 trustee is disbursing “payments to credi-\n tors.” §1326(c). The moment a case is converted from Chapter 13 to\n Chapter 7, a Chapter 13 trustee is stripped of authority to provide\n that “service.” P. 8.\n    (d) Section 1327(a), which provides that a confirmed Chapter 13\n plan “bind[s] the debtor and each creditor,” and §1326(a)(2), which\n instructs a trustee to distribute “payment[s] in accordance with the\n plan,” ceased to apply once the case was converted to Chapter 7.\n §103(i). Sections 1327(a) and 1326(a)(2), therefore, offer no support\n for Viegelahn’s assertion that the Bankruptcy Code requires a termi-\n nated Chapter 13 trustee to distribute to creditors postpetition wages\n remaining in the trustee’s possession. Continuing to distribute funds\n to creditors pursuant to a defunct Chapter 13 plan, moreover, is not\n                    Cite as: 575 U.

But creditors may gain protection\n  against the risk of excess accumulations in the hands of trustees by\n  seeking to have a Chapter 13 plan include a schedule for regular dis-\n  bursement of collected funds.

HARRIS, III, PETITIONER v. MARY K. \n\n       VIEGELAHN, CHAPTER 13 TRUSTEE\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [May 18, 2015] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns the disposition of wages earned by a\ndebtor after he petitions for bankruptcy. The treatment of\npostpetition wages generally depends on whether the\ndebtor is proceeding under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy\nCode (in which the debtor retains assets, often his home,\nduring bankruptcy subject to a court-approved plan for the\npayment of his debts) or Chapter 7 (in which the debtor’s\nassets are immediately liquidated and the proceeds dis­\ntributed to creditors). In a Chapter 13 proceeding, post-\npetition wages are “[p]roperty of the estate,” 11 U. S. C.\n§1306(a), and may be collected by the Chapter 13 trustee\nfor distribution to creditors, §1322(a)(1). In a Chapter 7\nproceeding, those earnings are not estate property; in­\nstead, they belong to the debtor. See §541(a)(1). The Code\npermits the debtor to convert a Chapter 13 proceeding to\none under Chapter 7 “at any time,” §1307(a); upon such\nconversion, the service of the Chapter 13 trustee termi­\nnates, §348(e).\n   When a debtor initially filing under Chapter 13 exercises\nhis right to convert to Chapter 7, who is entitled to post­\n2                  HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npetition wages still in the hands of the Chapter 13 trustee?\nNot the Chapter 7 estate when the conversion is in good\nfaith, all agree. May the trustee distribute the accumu­\nlated wage payments to creditors as the Chapter 13 plan\nrequired, or must she remit them to the debtor? That is\nthe question this case presents. We hold that, under the\ngoverning provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor\nwho converts to Chapter 7 is entitled to return of any\npostpetition wages not yet distributed by the Chapter 13\ntrustee.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   The Bankruptcy Code provides diverse courses overbur­\ndened debtors may pursue to gain discharge of their finan­\ncial obligations, and thereby a “fresh start.” Marrama v.\nCitizens Bank of Mass., 549 U. S. 365, 367 (2007) (quoting\nGrogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 286 (1991)). Two roads\nindividual debtors may take are relevant here: Chapter 7\nand Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings.\n   Chapter 7 allows a debtor to make a clean break from\nhis financial past, but at a steep price: prompt liquidation\nof the debtor’s assets. When a debtor files a Chapter 7\npetition, his assets, with specified exemptions, are imme­\ndiately transferred to a bankruptcy estate. §541(a)(1). A\nChapter 7 trustee is then charged with selling the prop­\nerty in the estate, §704(a)(1), and distributing the proceeds\nto the debtor’s creditors, §726. Crucially, however, a\nChapter 7 estate does not include the wages a debtor\nearns or the assets he acquires after the bankruptcy filing.\n§541(a)(1). Thus, while a Chapter 7 debtor must forfeit\nvirtually all his prepetition property, he is able to make a\n“fresh start” by shielding from creditors his postpetition\nearnings and acquisitions.\n   Chapter 13 works differently. A wholly voluntary alter­\nnative to Chapter 7, Chapter 13 allows a debtor to retain\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhis property if he proposes, and gains court confirmation\nof, a plan to repay his debts over a three- to five-year\nperiod. §1306(b), §1322, §1327(b). Payments under a\nChapter 13 plan are usually made from a debtor’s “future\nearnings or other future income.” §1322(a)(1); see 8 Col­\nlier on Bankruptcy ¶1322.02[1] (A. Resnick & H. Sommer\neds., 16th ed. 2014). Accordingly, the Chapter 13 estate\nfrom which creditors may be paid includes both the debt­\nor’s property at the time of his bankruptcy petition, and\nany wages and property acquired after filing. §1306(a). A\nChapter 13 trustee is often charged with collecting a\nportion of a debtor’s wages through payroll deduction, and\nwith distributing the withheld wages to creditors.\n   Proceedings under Chapter 13 can benefit debtors and\ncreditors alike. Debtors are allowed to retain their assets,\ncommonly their home or car. And creditors, entitled to a\nChapter 13 debtor’s “disposable” postpetition income,\n§1325(b)(1), usually collect more under a Chapter 13\nplan than they would have received under a Chapter 7\nliquidation.\n   Many debtors, however, fail to complete a Chapter 13\nplan successfully. See Porter, The Pretend Solution: An\nEmpirical Study of Bankruptcy Outcomes, 90 Texas\nL. Rev. 103, 107–111 (2011) (only one in three cases filed\nunder Chapter 13 ends in discharge). Recognizing that\nreality, Congress accorded debtors a nonwaivable right to\nconvert a Chapter 13 case to one under Chapter 7 “at any\ntime.” §1307(a). To effectuate a conversion, a debtor need\nonly file a notice with the bankruptcy court. Fed. Rule\nBkrtcy. Proc. 1017(f)(3). No motion or court order is needed\nto render the conversion effective. See ibid.\n   Conversion from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7 does not\ncommence a new bankruptcy case. The existing case\ncontinues along another track, Chapter 7 instead of Chap­\nter 13, without “effect[ing] a change in the date of the\nfiling of the petition.” §348(a). Conversion, however,\n4                 HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nimmediately “terminates the service” of the Chapter 13\ntrustee, replacing her with a Chapter 7 trustee. §348(e).\n                             B\n   In February 2010, petitioner Charles Harris III filed a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition. At the time of filing,\nHarris was indebted to multiple creditors, and had fallen\n$3,700 behind on payments to Chase Manhattan, his home\nmortgage lender.\n    Harris’ court-confirmed Chapter 13 plan provided that\nhe would immediately resume making monthly mortgage\npayments to Chase. The plan further provided that $530\nper month would be withheld from Harris’ postpetition\nwages and remitted to the Chapter 13 trustee, respondent\nMary Viegelahn. Viegelahn, in turn, would distribute\n$352 per month to Chase to pay down Harris’ outstanding\nmortgage debt. She would also distribute $75.34 per\nmonth to Harris’ only other secured lender, a consumer-\nelectronics store. Once those secured creditors were paid\nin full, Viegelahn was to begin distributing funds to Har­\nris’ unsecured creditors.\n   Implementation of the plan was short lived. Harris\nagain fell behind on his mortgage payments, and in No­\nvember 2010, Chase received permission from the Bank­\nruptcy Court to foreclose on Harris’ home. Following the\nforeclosure, Viegelahn continued to receive $530 per\nmonth from Harris’ wages, but stopped making the pay­\nments earmarked for Chase. As a result, funds formerly\nreserved for Chase accumulated in Viegelahn’s possession.\n   On November 22, 2011, Harris exercised his statutory\nright to convert his Chapter 13 case to one under Chapter\n7. By that time, Harris’ postpetition wages accumulated\nby Viegelahn amounted to $5,519.22. On December 1,\n2011—ten days after Harris’ conversion—Viegelahn dis­\nposed of those funds by giving $1,200 to Harris’ counsel,\npaying herself a $267.79 fee, and distributing the remain­\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

The Bankruptcy Court granted Harris’\nmotion, and the District Court affirmed.\n   The Fifth Circuit reversed. In re Harris, 757 F. 3d 468\n(2014). Finding “little guidance in the Bankruptcy Code,”\nid., at 478, the Fifth Circuit concluded that “considera­\ntions of equity and policy” rendered “the creditors’ claim to\nthe undistributed funds . . . superior to that of the debtor,”\nid., at 478, 481. Notwithstanding a Chapter 13 debtor’s\nconversion to Chapter 7, the Fifth Circuit held, a former\nChapter 13 trustee must distribute a debtor’s accumulated\npostpetition wages to his creditors.\n   The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that its decision con­\nflicted with the Third Circuit’s decision in In re Michael,\n699 F. 3d 305 (2012), which held that a debtor’s undistrib­\nuted postpetition wages “are to be returned to the debtor\nat the time of conversion [from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7].”\nId., at 307. We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict,\n574 U. S. ___ (2014), and now reverse the Fifth Circuit’s\njudgment.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   Prior to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, courts\ndivided three ways on the disposition of a debtor’s undis­\ntributed postpetition wages following conversion of a\nproceeding from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7. Some courts\nconcluded that undistributed postpetition wages reverted\nto the debtor. E.g., In re Boggs, 137 B. R. 408, 411 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. WD Wash. 1992). Others ordered a debtor’s undis-\ntributed postpetition earnings disbursed to creditors pur­\n6                  HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsuant to the terms of the confirmed (albeit terminated)\nChapter 13 plan. E.g., In re Waugh, 82 B. R. 394, 400\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Pa. 1988). Still other courts, including\nseveral Courts of Appeals, held that, upon conversion, all\npostpetition earnings and acquisitions became part of the\nnew Chapter 7 estate, thus augmenting the property\navailable for liquidation and distribution to creditors.\nE.g., In re Calder, 973 F. 2d 862, 865–866 (CA10 1992); In\nre Lybrook, 951 F. 2d 136, 137 (CA7 1991).\n  Congress addressed the matter in 1994 by adding\n§348(f) to the Bankruptcy Code. Rejecting the rulings of\nseveral Courts of Appeals, §348(f)(1)(A) provides that in a\ncase converted from Chapter 13, a debtor’s postpetition\nearnings and acquisitions do not become part of the new\nChapter 7 estate:\n    “[P]roperty of the [Chapter 7] estate in the converted\n    case shall consist of property of the estate, as of the\n    date of filing of the [initial Chapter 13] petition, that\n    remains in the possession of or is under the control of\n    the debtor on the date of conversion.”\nIn §348(f)(2), Congress added an exception for debtors who\nconvert in bad faith:\n    “If the debtor converts a case [initially filed] under\n    chapter 13 . . . in bad faith, the property of the estate\n    in the converted case shall consist of the property of\n    the estate as of the date of the conversion.”\n  Section 348(f), all agree, makes one thing clear: A debt­\nor’s postpetition wages, including undisbursed funds in\nthe hands of a trustee, ordinarily do not become part of the\nChapter 7 estate created by conversion. Absent a bad-\nfaith conversion, §348(f) limits a converted Chapter 7\nestate to property belonging to the debtor “as of the date”\nthe original Chapter 13 petition was filed. Postpetition\nwages, by definition, do not fit that bill.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   With this background, we turn to the question presented:\nWhat happens to postpetition wages held by a Chapter\n13 trustee at the time the case is converted to Chapter 7?\nDoes the Code require return of the funds to the debtor, or\ndoes it require their distribution to creditors? We con­\nclude that postpetition wages must be returned to the\ndebtor.\n   By excluding postpetition wages from the converted\nChapter 7 estate, §348(f)(1)(A) removes those earnings\nfrom the pool of assets that may be liquidated and distrib­\nuted to creditors. Allowing a terminated Chapter 13\ntrustee to disburse the very same earnings to the very\nsame creditors is incompatible with that statutory design.\nWe resist attributing to Congress, after explicitly exempt­\ning from Chapter 7’s liquidation-and-distribution process a\ndebtor’s postpetition wages, a plan to place those wages in\ncreditors’ hands another way.\n   Section 348(f)(2)’s exception for bad-faith conversions is\ninstructive in this regard. If a debtor converts in bad\nfaith—for example, by concealing assets in “unfair manip­\nulation of the bankruptcy system,” In re Siegfried, 219\nB. R. 581, 586 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Colo. 1998)—the converted\nChapter 7 estate “consist[s] of the property of the [Chapter\n13] estate as of the date of conversion.” §348(f)(2) (empha­\nsis added). Section 348(f)(2) thus penalizes bad-faith\ndebtors by making their postpetition wages available for\nliquidation and distribution to creditors. Conversely,\nwhen the conversion to Chapter 7 is made in good faith, no\npenalty is exacted. Shielding a Chapter 7 debtor’s post-\npetition earnings from creditors enables the “honest but\nunfortunate debtor” to make the “fresh start” the Bank­\nruptcy Code aims to facilitate. Marrama, 549 U. S., at 367\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Bad-faith conversions\napart, we find nothing in the Code denying debtors funds\nthat would have been theirs had the case proceeded under\n8                  HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nChapter 7 from the start. In sum, §348(f) does not say,\nexpressly: On conversion, accumulated wages go to the\ndebtor. But that is the most sensible reading of what\nCongress did provide.\n   Section 348(e) also informs our ruling that undistrib­\nuted postpetition wages must be returned to the debtor.\nThat section provides: “Conversion [from Chapter 13 to\nChapter 7] terminates the service of [the Chapter 13]\ntrustee.” A core service provided by a Chapter 13 trustee\nis the disbursement of “payments to creditors.” §1326(c)\n(emphasis added). The moment a case is converted from\nChapter 13 to Chapter 7, however, the Chapter 13 trustee\nis stripped of authority to provide that “service.” §348(e).\n   Section 348(e), of course, does not require a terminated\ntrustee to hold accumulated funds in perpetuity; she must\n(as we hold today) return undistributed postpetition wages\nto the debtor. Returning funds to a debtor, however, is not\na Chapter 13 trustee service as is making “paymen[t] to\ncreditors.” §1326(c). In this case, illustratively, Chapter\n13 trustee Viegelahn continued to act in that capacity\nafter her tenure ended. Eight days after the case was\nconverted to Chapter 7, she filed with the Bankruptcy\nCourt a document titled “Trustee’s Recommendations\nConcerning Claims,” recommending distribution of the\nfunds originally earmarked for Chase to the remaining\nsecured creditor and six of the 13 unsecured creditors. No.\n10–50655 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tex., Nov. 30, 2011), Doc. 34.\nShe then acted on that recommendation. She thus provided\na Chapter 13 trustee “service,” although barred from\ndoing so by §348(e). Returning undistributed wages to the\ndebtor, in contrast, renders no Chapter 13-authorized\n“service.”\n                           C\n  Viegelahn cites two Chapter 13 provisions in support of\nher argument that the Bankruptcy Code requires a termi­\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnated Chapter 13 trustee “to distribute undisbursed funds\nto creditors.” Brief for Respondent 21. The first, §1327(a),\nprovides that a confirmed Chapter 13 plan “bind[s] the\ndebtor and each creditor.” The second, §1326(a)(2), in­\nstructs a trustee to distribute “payment[s] in accordance\nwith the plan,” and that, Viegelahn observes, is just\nwhat she did. But the cited provisions had no force here,\nfor they ceased to apply once the case was converted to\nChapter 7.\n  When a debtor exercises his statutory right to convert,\nthe case is placed under Chapter 7’s governance, and no\nChapter 13 provision holds sway. §103(i) (“Chapter 13 . . .\napplies only in a case under [that] chapter.”). Harris\nhaving converted the case, the Chapter 13 plan was no\nlonger “bind[ing].” §1327(a). And Viegelahn, by then the\nformer Chapter 13 trustee, lacked authority to distribute\n“payment[s] in accordance with the plan.” §1326(a)(2); see\n§348(e).\n  Nor can we credit the suggestion that a confirmed Chap­\nter 13 plan gives creditors a vested right to funds held by a\ntrustee. “[N]o provision in the Bankruptcy Code classifies\nany property, including post-petition wages, as belonging\nto creditors.” Michael, 699 F. 3d, at 312–313.\n  Viegelahn alternatively urges that a terminated Chap­\nter 13 trustee’s “duty” to distribute funds to creditors is a\nfacet of the trustee’s obligation to “wind up” the affairs of\nthe Chapter 13 estate following conversion. Brief for\nRespondent 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nFederal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, however, specify\nwhat a terminated Chapter 13 trustee must do post-\nconversion: (1) she must turn over records and assets to\nthe Chapter 7 trustee, Rule 1019(4); and (2) she must file\na report with the United States bankruptcy trustee, Rule\n1019(5)(B)(ii). Continuing to distribute funds to creditors\npursuant to the defunct Chapter 13 plan is not an author­\nized “wind-up” task.\n10                 HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Finally, Viegelahn homes in on a particular feature of\nthis case. Section 1327(b) states that “[e]xcept as other­\nwise provided in the [Chapter 13] plan . . . the confirma­\ntion of a plan vests all of the property of the estate in the\ndebtor.” Harris’ plan “otherwise provided”: It stated that\n“[u]pon confirmation of the plan, all property of the estate\nshall not vest in the Debto[r], but shall remain as property\nof the estate.” App. 31 (emphasis added). That plan lan­\nguage does not change the outcome here. Harris’ wages\nmay have been “property of the estate” while his case\nproceeded under Chapter 13, but estate property does not\nbecome property of creditors until it is distributed to them.\nSee Michael, 699 F. 3d, at 313. Moreover, the order con­\nfirming Harris’ plan provided that upon conversion to\nChapter 7, “[s]uch property as may revest in the debtor\nshall so revest.” App. 48. Pursuant to that provision,\nproperty formerly in the Chapter 13 estate that did not\nbecome part of the Chapter 7 estate revested in Harris;\nhere, Harris’ postpetition wages so revested.\n                               D\n  The Fifth Circuit expressed concern that debtors would\nreceive a “windfall” if they could reclaim accumulated\nwages from a terminated Chapter 13 trustee. 757 F. 3d, at\n478–481. As explained, however, see supra at 2–3, Chap­\nter 13 is a voluntary proceeding in which debtors endeavor\nto discharge their obligations using postpetition earnings\nthat are off-limits to creditors in a Chapter 7 proceeding.\nWe do not regard as a “windfall” a debtor’s receipt of a\nfraction of the wages he earned and would have kept had\nhe filed under Chapter 7 in the first place.\n  We acknowledge the “fortuit[y],” as the Fifth Circuit\ncalled it, that a “debtor’s chance of having funds returned”\nis “dependent on the trustee’s speed in distributing the\npayments” to creditors. 757 F. 3d, at 479, and n. 10. A\ntrustee who distributes payments regularly may have\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

When a trustee\ndistributes payments infrequently, on the other hand, a\ndebtor who converts to Chapter 7 may be entitled to a\nsizable refund. These outcomes, however, follow directly\nfrom Congress’ decisions to shield postpetition wages from\ncreditors in a converted Chapter 7 case, §348(f)(1)(A), and\nto give Chapter 13 debtors a right to convert to Chapter 7\n“at any time,” §1307(a). Moreover, creditors may gain\nprotection against the risk of excess accumulations in the\nhands of Chapter 13 trustees by seeking to include in a\nChapter 13 plan a schedule for regular disbursement of\nfunds the trustee collects.\n                        *   *        *\n  For the reasons stated, the       judgment of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the     Fifth Circuit is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for        further proceedings con­\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 2801432, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/05/18/harris_v._viegelahn.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2014                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued April 1, 2015—Decided May 18, 2015\nIndividual debtors may seek discharge of their financial obligations\n  under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. In a\n  Chapter 7 proceeding, the debtor’s assets are transferred to a bank-\n  ruptcy estate. 11 U. S. C. §541(a)(1). The estate’s assets are then\n  promptly liquidated, §704(a)(1), and distributed to creditors, §726. A\n  Chapter 7 estate, however, does not include the wages a debtor earns\n  or the assets he acquires after the bankruptcy filing. §541(a)(1).\n  Chapter 13, a wholly voluntary alternative to Chapter 7, permits the\n  debtor to retain assets during bankruptcy subject to a court-approved\n  plan for payment of his debts. Payments under a Chapter 13 plan\n  are usually made from a debtor’s “future income.” 1322(a)(1). The\n  Chapter 13 estate, unlike a Chapter 7 estate, therefore includes both\n  the debtor’s property at the time of his bankruptcy petition, and any\n  assets he acquires after filing. §1306(a). Because many debtors fail to\n  complete a Chapter 13 plan successfully, Congress accorded debtors a\n  nonwaivable right to convert a Chapter 13 case to one under Chapter\n  7 “at any time.” §1307(a). Conversion does not commence a new\n  bankruptcy case, but it does terminate the service of the Chapter 13\n  trustee. §348(e).\n    Petitioner Harris, indebted to multiple creditors and $3,700 behind\n  on his home mortgage payments to Chase Manhattan, filed a Chap-\n  ter 13 bankruptcy petition. His court-confirmed plan provided that\n  he would resume making monthly mortgage payments to Chase, and\n  that $530 per month would be withheld from his postpetition wages\n  and remitted to the Chapter 13 trustee, respondent Viegelahn. Trus-\n  tee Viegelahn would make monthly payments to Chase to pay down\n  Harris’ mortgage arrears, and distribute remaining funds to Harris’\n  other creditors. When Harris again fell behind on his mortgage pay-\n2                        HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ments, Chase foreclosed on his home. Following the foreclosure, Vie-\n    gelahn continued to receive $530 per month from Harris’ wages, but\n    stopped making the payments earmarked for Chase. As a result,\n    funds formerly reserved for Chase accumulated in Viegelahn’s pos-\n    session. Approximately a year after the foreclosure, Harris converted\n    his case to Chapter 7. Ten days after this conversion, Viegelahn dis-\n    tributed $5,519.22 in Harris’ withheld wages mainly to Harris’ credi-\n    tors. Asserting that Viegelahn lacked authority to disburse his post-\n    petition wages to creditors postconversion, Harris sought an order\n    from the Bankruptcy Court directing refund of the accumulated wag-\n    es Viegelahn paid to his creditors. The Bankruptcy Court granted\n    Harris’ motion, and the District Court affirmed. The Fifth Circuit re-\n    versed, concluding that a former Chapter 13 trustee must distribute\n    a debtor’s accumulated postpetition wages to his creditors.\nHeld: A debtor who converts to Chapter 7 is entitled to return of any\n postpetition wages not yet distributed by the Chapter 13 trustee.\n Pp. 5–11.\n    (a) Absent a bad-faith conversion, §348(f) limits a converted Chap-\n ter 7 estate to property belonging to the debtor “as of the date” the\n original Chapter 13 petition was filed. Because postpetition wages do\n not fit that bill, undistributed wages collected by a Chapter 13 trus-\n tee ordinarily do not become part of a converted Chapter 7 estate.\n Pp. 5–6.\n    (b) By excluding postpetition wages from the converted Chapter 7\n estate (absent a bad-faith conversion), §348(f) removes those earnings\n from the pool of assets that may be liquidated and distributed to\n creditors. Allowing a terminated Chapter 13 trustee to disburse the\n very same earnings to the very same creditors is incompatible with\n that statutory design. Pp. 7–8.\n    (c) This conclusion is reinforced by §348(e), which “terminates the\n service of [the Chapter 13] trustee” upon conversion. One service\n provided by a Chapter 13 trustee is disbursing “payments to credi-\n tors.” §1326(c). The moment a case is converted from Chapter 13 to\n Chapter 7, a Chapter 13 trustee is stripped of authority to provide\n that “service.” P. 8.\n    (d) Section 1327(a), which provides that a confirmed Chapter 13\n plan “bind[s] the debtor and each creditor,” and §1326(a)(2), which\n instructs a trustee to distribute “payment[s] in accordance with the\n plan,” ceased to apply once the case was converted to Chapter 7.\n §103(i). Sections 1327(a) and 1326(a)(2), therefore, offer no support\n for Viegelahn’s assertion that the Bankruptcy Code requires a termi-\n nated Chapter 13 trustee to distribute to creditors postpetition wages\n remaining in the trustee’s possession.

But creditors may gain protection\n  against the risk of excess accumulations in the hands of trustees by\n  seeking to have a Chapter 13 plan include a schedule for regular dis-\n  bursement of collected funds.

HARRIS, III, PETITIONER v. MARY K. \n\n       VIEGELAHN, CHAPTER 13 TRUSTEE\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [May 18, 2015] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns the disposition of wages earned by a\ndebtor after he petitions for bankruptcy. The treatment of\npostpetition wages generally depends on whether the\ndebtor is proceeding under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy\nCode (in which the debtor retains assets, often his home,\nduring bankruptcy subject to a court-approved plan for the\npayment of his debts) or Chapter 7 (in which the debtor’s\nassets are immediately liquidated and the proceeds dis­\ntributed to creditors). In a Chapter 13 proceeding, post-\npetition wages are “[p]roperty of the estate,” 11 U. S. C.\n§1306(a), and may be collected by the Chapter 13 trustee\nfor distribution to creditors, §1322(a)(1). In a Chapter 7\nproceeding, those earnings are not estate property; in­\nstead, they belong to the debtor. See §541(a)(1). The Code\npermits the debtor to convert a Chapter 13 proceeding to\none under Chapter 7 “at any time,” §1307(a); upon such\nconversion, the service of the Chapter 13 trustee termi­\nnates, §348(e).\n   When a debtor initially filing under Chapter 13 exercises\nhis right to convert to Chapter 7, who is entitled to post­\n2                  HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npetition wages still in the hands of the Chapter 13 trustee?\nNot the Chapter 7 estate when the conversion is in good\nfaith, all agree. May the trustee distribute the accumu­\nlated wage payments to creditors as the Chapter 13 plan\nrequired, or must she remit them to the debtor? That is\nthe question this case presents. We hold that, under the\ngoverning provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor\nwho converts to Chapter 7 is entitled to return of any\npostpetition wages not yet distributed by the Chapter 13\ntrustee.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   The Bankruptcy Code provides diverse courses overbur­\ndened debtors may pursue to gain discharge of their finan­\ncial obligations, and thereby a “fresh start.” Marrama v.\nCitizens Bank of Mass., 549 U. S. 365, 367 (2007) (quoting\nGrogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 286 (1991)). Two roads\nindividual debtors may take are relevant here: Chapter 7\nand Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings.\n   Chapter 7 allows a debtor to make a clean break from\nhis financial past, but at a steep price: prompt liquidation\nof the debtor’s assets. When a debtor files a Chapter 7\npetition, his assets, with specified exemptions, are imme­\ndiately transferred to a bankruptcy estate. §541(a)(1). A\nChapter 7 trustee is then charged with selling the prop­\nerty in the estate, §704(a)(1), and distributing the proceeds\nto the debtor’s creditors, §726. Crucially, however, a\nChapter 7 estate does not include the wages a debtor\nearns or the assets he acquires after the bankruptcy filing.\n§541(a)(1). Thus, while a Chapter 7 debtor must forfeit\nvirtually all his prepetition property, he is able to make a\n“fresh start” by shielding from creditors his postpetition\nearnings and acquisitions.\n   Chapter 13 works differently. A wholly voluntary alter­\nnative to Chapter 7, Chapter 13 allows a debtor to retain\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhis property if he proposes, and gains court confirmation\nof, a plan to repay his debts over a three- to five-year\nperiod. §1306(b), §1322, §1327(b). Payments under a\nChapter 13 plan are usually made from a debtor’s “future\nearnings or other future income.” §1322(a)(1); see 8 Col­\nlier on Bankruptcy ¶1322.02[1] (A. Resnick & H. Sommer\neds., 16th ed. 2014). Accordingly, the Chapter 13 estate\nfrom which creditors may be paid includes both the debt­\nor’s property at the time of his bankruptcy petition, and\nany wages and property acquired after filing. §1306(a). A\nChapter 13 trustee is often charged with collecting a\nportion of a debtor’s wages through payroll deduction, and\nwith distributing the withheld wages to creditors.\n   Proceedings under Chapter 13 can benefit debtors and\ncreditors alike. Debtors are allowed to retain their assets,\ncommonly their home or car. And creditors, entitled to a\nChapter 13 debtor’s “disposable” postpetition income,\n§1325(b)(1), usually collect more under a Chapter 13\nplan than they would have received under a Chapter 7\nliquidation.\n   Many debtors, however, fail to complete a Chapter 13\nplan successfully. See Porter, The Pretend Solution: An\nEmpirical Study of Bankruptcy Outcomes, 90 Texas\nL. Rev. 103, 107–111 (2011) (only one in three cases filed\nunder Chapter 13 ends in discharge). Recognizing that\nreality, Congress accorded debtors a nonwaivable right to\nconvert a Chapter 13 case to one under Chapter 7 “at any\ntime.” §1307(a). To effectuate a conversion, a debtor need\nonly file a notice with the bankruptcy court. Fed. Rule\nBkrtcy. Proc. 1017(f)(3). No motion or court order is needed\nto render the conversion effective. See ibid.\n   Conversion from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7 does not\ncommence a new bankruptcy case. The existing case\ncontinues along another track, Chapter 7 instead of Chap­\nter 13, without “effect[ing] a change in the date of the\nfiling of the petition.” §348(a). Conversion, however,\n4                 HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nimmediately “terminates the service” of the Chapter 13\ntrustee, replacing her with a Chapter 7 trustee. §348(e).\n                             B\n   In February 2010, petitioner Charles Harris III filed a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition. At the time of filing,\nHarris was indebted to multiple creditors, and had fallen\n$3,700 behind on payments to Chase Manhattan, his home\nmortgage lender.\n    Harris’ court-confirmed Chapter 13 plan provided that\nhe would immediately resume making monthly mortgage\npayments to Chase. The plan further provided that $530\nper month would be withheld from Harris’ postpetition\nwages and remitted to the Chapter 13 trustee, respondent\nMary Viegelahn. Viegelahn, in turn, would distribute\n$352 per month to Chase to pay down Harris’ outstanding\nmortgage debt. She would also distribute $75.34 per\nmonth to Harris’ only other secured lender, a consumer-\nelectronics store. Once those secured creditors were paid\nin full, Viegelahn was to begin distributing funds to Har­\nris’ unsecured creditors.\n   Implementation of the plan was short lived. Harris\nagain fell behind on his mortgage payments, and in No­\nvember 2010, Chase received permission from the Bank­\nruptcy Court to foreclose on Harris’ home. Following the\nforeclosure, Viegelahn continued to receive $530 per\nmonth from Harris’ wages, but stopped making the pay­\nments earmarked for Chase. As a result, funds formerly\nreserved for Chase accumulated in Viegelahn’s possession.\n   On November 22, 2011, Harris exercised his statutory\nright to convert his Chapter 13 case to one under Chapter\n7. By that time, Harris’ postpetition wages accumulated\nby Viegelahn amounted to $5,519.22. On December 1,\n2011—ten days after Harris’ conversion—Viegelahn dis­\nposed of those funds by giving $1,200 to Harris’ counsel,\npaying herself a $267.79 fee, and distributing the remain­\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

The Bankruptcy Court granted Harris’\nmotion, and the District Court affirmed.\n   The Fifth Circuit reversed. In re Harris, 757 F. 3d 468\n(2014). Finding “little guidance in the Bankruptcy Code,”\nid., at 478, the Fifth Circuit concluded that “considera­\ntions of equity and policy” rendered “the creditors’ claim to\nthe undistributed funds . . . superior to that of the debtor,”\nid., at 478, 481. Notwithstanding a Chapter 13 debtor’s\nconversion to Chapter 7, the Fifth Circuit held, a former\nChapter 13 trustee must distribute a debtor’s accumulated\npostpetition wages to his creditors.\n   The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that its decision con­\nflicted with the Third Circuit’s decision in In re Michael,\n699 F. 3d 305 (2012), which held that a debtor’s undistrib­\nuted postpetition wages “are to be returned to the debtor\nat the time of conversion [from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7].”\nId., at 307. We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict,\n574 U. S. ___ (2014), and now reverse the Fifth Circuit’s\njudgment.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   Prior to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, courts\ndivided three ways on the disposition of a debtor’s undis­\ntributed postpetition wages following conversion of a\nproceeding from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7. Some courts\nconcluded that undistributed postpetition wages reverted\nto the debtor. E.g., In re Boggs, 137 B. R. 408, 411 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. WD Wash. 1992). Others ordered a debtor’s undis-\ntributed postpetition earnings disbursed to creditors pur­\n6                  HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsuant to the terms of the confirmed (albeit terminated)\nChapter 13 plan. E.g., In re Waugh, 82 B. R. 394, 400\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Pa. 1988). Still other courts, including\nseveral Courts of Appeals, held that, upon conversion, all\npostpetition earnings and acquisitions became part of the\nnew Chapter 7 estate, thus augmenting the property\navailable for liquidation and distribution to creditors.\nE.g., In re Calder, 973 F. 2d 862, 865–866 (CA10 1992); In\nre Lybrook, 951 F. 2d 136, 137 (CA7 1991).\n  Congress addressed the matter in 1994 by adding\n§348(f) to the Bankruptcy Code. Rejecting the rulings of\nseveral Courts of Appeals, §348(f)(1)(A) provides that in a\ncase converted from Chapter 13, a debtor’s postpetition\nearnings and acquisitions do not become part of the new\nChapter 7 estate:\n    “[P]roperty of the [Chapter 7] estate in the converted\n    case shall consist of property of the estate, as of the\n    date of filing of the [initial Chapter 13] petition, that\n    remains in the possession of or is under the control of\n    the debtor on the date of conversion.”\nIn §348(f)(2), Congress added an exception for debtors who\nconvert in bad faith:\n    “If the debtor converts a case [initially filed] under\n    chapter 13 . . . in bad faith, the property of the estate\n    in the converted case shall consist of the property of\n    the estate as of the date of the conversion.”\n  Section 348(f), all agree, makes one thing clear: A debt­\nor’s postpetition wages, including undisbursed funds in\nthe hands of a trustee, ordinarily do not become part of the\nChapter 7 estate created by conversion. Absent a bad-\nfaith conversion, §348(f) limits a converted Chapter 7\nestate to property belonging to the debtor “as of the date”\nthe original Chapter 13 petition was filed. Postpetition\nwages, by definition, do not fit that bill.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   With this background, we turn to the question presented:\nWhat happens to postpetition wages held by a Chapter\n13 trustee at the time the case is converted to Chapter 7?\nDoes the Code require return of the funds to the debtor, or\ndoes it require their distribution to creditors? We con­\nclude that postpetition wages must be returned to the\ndebtor.\n   By excluding postpetition wages from the converted\nChapter 7 estate, §348(f)(1)(A) removes those earnings\nfrom the pool of assets that may be liquidated and distrib­\nuted to creditors. Allowing a terminated Chapter 13\ntrustee to disburse the very same earnings to the very\nsame creditors is incompatible with that statutory design.\nWe resist attributing to Congress, after explicitly exempt­\ning from Chapter 7’s liquidation-and-distribution process a\ndebtor’s postpetition wages, a plan to place those wages in\ncreditors’ hands another way.\n   Section 348(f)(2)’s exception for bad-faith conversions is\ninstructive in this regard. If a debtor converts in bad\nfaith—for example, by concealing assets in “unfair manip­\nulation of the bankruptcy system,” In re Siegfried, 219\nB. R. 581, 586 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Colo. 1998)—the converted\nChapter 7 estate “consist[s] of the property of the [Chapter\n13] estate as of the date of conversion.” §348(f)(2) (empha­\nsis added). Section 348(f)(2) thus penalizes bad-faith\ndebtors by making their postpetition wages available for\nliquidation and distribution to creditors. Conversely,\nwhen the conversion to Chapter 7 is made in good faith, no\npenalty is exacted. Shielding a Chapter 7 debtor’s post-\npetition earnings from creditors enables the “honest but\nunfortunate debtor” to make the “fresh start” the Bank­\nruptcy Code aims to facilitate. Marrama, 549 U. S., at 367\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Bad-faith conversions\napart, we find nothing in the Code denying debtors funds\nthat would have been theirs had the case proceeded under\n8                  HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nChapter 7 from the start. In sum, §348(f) does not say,\nexpressly: On conversion, accumulated wages go to the\ndebtor. But that is the most sensible reading of what\nCongress did provide.\n   Section 348(e) also informs our ruling that undistrib­\nuted postpetition wages must be returned to the debtor.\nThat section provides: “Conversion [from Chapter 13 to\nChapter 7] terminates the service of [the Chapter 13]\ntrustee.” A core service provided by a Chapter 13 trustee\nis the disbursement of “payments to creditors.” §1326(c)\n(emphasis added). The moment a case is converted from\nChapter 13 to Chapter 7, however, the Chapter 13 trustee\nis stripped of authority to provide that “service.” §348(e).\n   Section 348(e), of course, does not require a terminated\ntrustee to hold accumulated funds in perpetuity; she must\n(as we hold today) return undistributed postpetition wages\nto the debtor. Returning funds to a debtor, however, is not\na Chapter 13 trustee service as is making “paymen[t] to\ncreditors.” §1326(c). In this case, illustratively, Chapter\n13 trustee Viegelahn continued to act in that capacity\nafter her tenure ended. Eight days after the case was\nconverted to Chapter 7, she filed with the Bankruptcy\nCourt a document titled “Trustee’s Recommendations\nConcerning Claims,” recommending distribution of the\nfunds originally earmarked for Chase to the remaining\nsecured creditor and six of the 13 unsecured creditors. No.\n10–50655 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tex., Nov. 30, 2011), Doc. 34.\nShe then acted on that recommendation. She thus provided\na Chapter 13 trustee “service,” although barred from\ndoing so by §348(e). Returning undistributed wages to the\ndebtor, in contrast, renders no Chapter 13-authorized\n“service.”\n                           C\n  Viegelahn cites two Chapter 13 provisions in support of\nher argument that the Bankruptcy Code requires a termi­\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnated Chapter 13 trustee “to distribute undisbursed funds\nto creditors.” Brief for Respondent 21. The first, §1327(a),\nprovides that a confirmed Chapter 13 plan “bind[s] the\ndebtor and each creditor.” The second, §1326(a)(2), in­\nstructs a trustee to distribute “payment[s] in accordance\nwith the plan,” and that, Viegelahn observes, is just\nwhat she did. But the cited provisions had no force here,\nfor they ceased to apply once the case was converted to\nChapter 7.\n  When a debtor exercises his statutory right to convert,\nthe case is placed under Chapter 7’s governance, and no\nChapter 13 provision holds sway. §103(i) (“Chapter 13 . . .\napplies only in a case under [that] chapter.”). Harris\nhaving converted the case, the Chapter 13 plan was no\nlonger “bind[ing].” §1327(a). And Viegelahn, by then the\nformer Chapter 13 trustee, lacked authority to distribute\n“payment[s] in accordance with the plan.” §1326(a)(2); see\n§348(e).\n  Nor can we credit the suggestion that a confirmed Chap­\nter 13 plan gives creditors a vested right to funds held by a\ntrustee. “[N]o provision in the Bankruptcy Code classifies\nany property, including post-petition wages, as belonging\nto creditors.” Michael, 699 F. 3d, at 312–313.\n  Viegelahn alternatively urges that a terminated Chap­\nter 13 trustee’s “duty” to distribute funds to creditors is a\nfacet of the trustee’s obligation to “wind up” the affairs of\nthe Chapter 13 estate following conversion. Brief for\nRespondent 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nFederal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, however, specify\nwhat a terminated Chapter 13 trustee must do post-\nconversion: (1) she must turn over records and assets to\nthe Chapter 7 trustee, Rule 1019(4); and (2) she must file\na report with the United States bankruptcy trustee, Rule\n1019(5)(B)(ii). Continuing to distribute funds to creditors\npursuant to the defunct Chapter 13 plan is not an author­\nized “wind-up” task.\n10                 HARRIS v. VIEGELAHN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Finally, Viegelahn homes in on a particular feature of\nthis case. Section 1327(b) states that “[e]xcept as other­\nwise provided in the [Chapter 13] plan . . . the confirma­\ntion of a plan vests all of the property of the estate in the\ndebtor.” Harris’ plan “otherwise provided”: It stated that\n“[u]pon confirmation of the plan, all property of the estate\nshall not vest in the Debto[r], but shall remain as property\nof the estate.” App. 31 (emphasis added). That plan lan­\nguage does not change the outcome here. Harris’ wages\nmay have been “property of the estate” while his case\nproceeded under Chapter 13, but estate property does not\nbecome property of creditors until it is distributed to them.\nSee Michael, 699 F. 3d, at 313. Moreover, the order con­\nfirming Harris’ plan provided that upon conversion to\nChapter 7, “[s]uch property as may revest in the debtor\nshall so revest.” App. 48. Pursuant to that provision,\nproperty formerly in the Chapter 13 estate that did not\nbecome part of the Chapter 7 estate revested in Harris;\nhere, Harris’ postpetition wages so revested.\n                               D\n  The Fifth Circuit expressed concern that debtors would\nreceive a “windfall” if they could reclaim accumulated\nwages from a terminated Chapter 13 trustee. 757 F. 3d, at\n478–481. As explained, however, see supra at 2–3, Chap­\nter 13 is a voluntary proceeding in which debtors endeavor\nto discharge their obligations using postpetition earnings\nthat are off-limits to creditors in a Chapter 7 proceeding.\nWe do not regard as a “windfall” a debtor’s receipt of a\nfraction of the wages he earned and would have kept had\nhe filed under Chapter 7 in the first place.\n  We acknowledge the “fortuit[y],” as the Fifth Circuit\ncalled it, that a “debtor’s chance of having funds returned”\nis “dependent on the trustee’s speed in distributing the\npayments” to creditors. 757 F. 3d, at 479, and n. 10. A\ntrustee who distributes payments regularly may have\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                 11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlittle or no accumulated wages to return. When a trustee\ndistributes payments infrequently, on the other hand, a\ndebtor who converts to Chapter 7 may be entitled to a\nsizable refund. These outcomes, however, follow directly\nfrom Congress’ decisions to shield postpetition wages from\ncreditors in a converted Chapter 7 case, §348(f)(1)(A), and\nto give Chapter 13 debtors a right to convert to Chapter 7\n“at any time,” §1307(a). Moreover, creditors may gain\nprotection against the risk of excess accumulations in the\nhands of Chapter 13 trustees by seeking to include in a\nChapter 13 plan a schedule for regular disbursement of\nfunds the trustee collects.\n                        *   *        *\n  For the reasons stated, the       judgment of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the     Fifth Circuit is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for        further proceedings con­\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2801432/", "sha1": "a6b9f561c87d0bd0defb516dfbb70b18270c3057", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-05-18T08:01:54.795503"}
