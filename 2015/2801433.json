Argued November 12, 2014—Decided May 18, 2015\nMaryland’s personal income tax on state residents consists of a “state”\n income tax, Md. Tax-Gen. Code Ann. §10–105(a), and a “county” in-\n come tax, §§10–103, 10–106. Residents who pay income tax to anoth-\n er jurisdiction for income earned in that other jurisdiction are al-\n lowed a credit against the “state” tax but not the “county” tax. §10–\n 703. Nonresidents who earn income from sources within Maryland\n must pay the “state” income tax, §§10–105(d), 10–210, and nonresi-\n dents not subject to the county tax must pay a “special nonresident\n tax” in lieu of the “county” tax, §10–106.1.\n   Respondents, Maryland residents, earned pass-through income\n from a Subchapter S corporation that earned income in several\n States. Respondents claimed an income tax credit on their 2006\n Maryland income tax return for taxes paid to other States. The Mary-\n land State Comptroller of the Treasury, petitioner here, allowed re-\n spondents a credit against their “state” income tax but not against\n their “county” income tax and assessed a tax deficiency. That deci-\n sion was affirmed by the Hearings and Appeals Section of the Comp-\n troller’s Office and by the Maryland Tax Court, but the Circuit Court\n for Howard County reversed on the ground that Maryland’s tax sys-\n tem violated the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. The\n Court of Appeals of Maryland affirmed and held that the tax uncon-\n stitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce.\nHeld: Maryland’s personal income tax scheme violates the dormant\n Commerce Clause. Pp. 4–28.\n    (a) The Commerce Clause, which grants Congress power to “regu-\n late Commerce . . . among the several States,” Art I, §8, cl. 3, also has\n “a further, negative command, known as the dormant Commerce\n Clause,” Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S.\n2          COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v.

State Tax Comm’n, 429 U. S. 318, 332, n. 12. Thus, inter\n    alia, a State “may not tax a transaction or incident more heavily\n    when it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirely within the\n    State,” Armco Inc. v. Hardesty, 467 U. S. 638, 642, or “impose a tax\n    which discriminates against interstate commerce either by providing\n    a direct commercial advantage to local business, or by subjecting in-\n    terstate commerce to the burden of ‘multiple taxation,’ ” Northwestern\n    States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 458. Pp. 4–\n    6.\n       (b) The result in this case is all but dictated by this Court’s\n    dormant Commerce Clause cases, particularly J. D. Adams Mfg. Co.\n    v. Storen, 304 U. S. 307, 311, Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v.\n    Henneford, 305 U. S. 434, 439, and Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v.\n    Mealey, 334 U. S. 653, 662, which all invalidated state tax schemes\n    that might lead to double taxation of out-of-state income and that\n    discriminated in favor of intrastate over interstate economic activity.\n    Pp. 6–7.\n       (c) This conclusion is not affected by the fact that these three cases\n    involved a tax on gross receipts rather than net income, and a tax on\n    corporations rather than individuals. This Court’s decisions have\n    previously rejected the formal distinction between gross receipts and\n    net income taxes. And there is no reason the dormant Commerce\n    Clause should treat individuals less favorably than corporations; in\n    addition, the taxes invalidated in J. D. Adams and Gwin, White ap-\n    plied to the income of both individuals and corporations. Nor does\n    the right of the individual to vote in political elections justify dispar-\n    ate treatment of corporate and personal income. Thus the Court has\n    previously entertained and even sustained dormant Commerce\n    Clause challenges by individual residents of the State that imposed\n    the alleged burden on interstate commerce. See Department of Reve-\n    nue of Ky. v. Davis, 553 U. S. 328, 336; Granholm v. Heald, 544 U. S.\n    460, 469 (2005). Pp. 7–12.\n       (d) Maryland’s tax scheme is not immune from dormant Commerce\n    Clause scrutiny simply because Maryland has the jurisdictional pow-\n    er under the Due Process Clause to impose the tax. “[W]hile a state\n    may, consistent with the Due Process Clause, have the authority to\n    tax a particular taxpayer, imposition of the tax may nonetheless vio-\n    late the Commerce Clause.” Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U. S.\n    298, 305. Pp. 12–15.\n       (e) Maryland’s income tax scheme discriminates against interstate\n    commerce.

Maryland’s in-\n  come tax scheme fails the internal consistency test because if every\n  State adopted Maryland’s tax structure, interstate commerce would\n  be taxed at a higher rate than intrastate commerce. Maryland’s tax\n  scheme is inherently discriminatory and operates as a tariff, which is\n  fatal because tariffs are “[t]he paradigmatic example of a law dis-\n  criminating against interstate commerce.” West Lynn Creamery, Inc.\n  v. Healy, 512 U. S. 186, 193. Petitioner emphasizes that by offering\n  residents who earn income in interstate commerce a credit against\n  the “state” portion of the income tax, Maryland actually receives less\n  tax revenue from residents who earn income from interstate com-\n  merce rather than intrastate commerce, but this argument is a red\n  herring. The critical point is that the total tax burden on interstate\n  commerce is higher.

BRIAN WYNNE ET UX.\n  ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF \n\n                     MARYLAND\n\n                                [May 18, 2015] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case involves the constitutionality of an unusual\nfeature of Maryland’s personal income tax scheme. Like\nmany other States, Maryland taxes the income its resi­\ndents earn both within and outside the State, as well as\nthe income that nonresidents earn from sources within\nMaryland. But unlike most other States, Maryland does\nnot offer its residents a full credit against the income\ntaxes that they pay to other States. The effect of this\nscheme is that some of the income earned by Maryland\nresidents outside the State is taxed twice. Maryland’s\nscheme creates an incentive for taxpayers to opt for intra­\nstate rather than interstate economic activity.\n   We have long held that States cannot subject corporate\nincome to tax schemes similar to Maryland’s, and we see\nno reason why income earned by individuals should be\ntreated less favorably. Maryland admits that its law has\nthe same economic effect as a state tariff, the quintessen­\ntial evil targeted by the dormant Commerce Clause. We\ntherefore affirm the decision of Maryland’s highest court\nand hold that this feature of the State’s tax scheme vio­\n2      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v.

The income tax that Mary­\nland imposes upon its own residents has two parts: a\n“state” income tax, which is set at a graduated rate, Md.\nTax-Gen. Code Ann. §10–105(a) (Supp. 2014), and a so-\ncalled “county” income tax, which is set at a rate that\nvaries by county but is capped at 3.2%, §§10–103, 10–106\n(2010). Despite the names that Maryland has assigned to\nthese taxes, both are State taxes, and both are collected by\nthe State’s Comptroller of the Treasury. Frey v. Comptrol-\nler of Treasury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2324620\"><a href=\"/opinion/2324620/frey-v-comptroller/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 125, 141–142, 29 A. 3d 475,\n483, 492 (2011). Of course, some Maryland residents earn\nincome in other States, and some of those States also tax\nthis income. If Maryland residents pay income tax to\nanother jurisdiction for income earned there, Maryland\nallows them a credit against the “state” tax but not the\n“county” tax. §10–703; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 156–157, 64 A. 3d\n453, 458 (2013) (case below). As a result, part of the in­\ncome that a Maryland resident earns outside the State\nmay be taxed twice.\n   Maryland also taxes the income of nonresidents. This\ntax has two parts. First, nonresidents must pay the\n“state” income tax on all the income that they earn from\nsources within Maryland. §§10–105(d) (Supp. 2014), 10–\n210 (2010). Second, nonresidents not subject to the county\ntax must pay a “special nonresident tax” in lieu of the\n“county” tax. §10–106.1; Frey, supra, at 125–126, 29 A.\n3d, at 483. The “special nonresident tax” is levied on\nincome earned from sources within Maryland, and its rate\nis “equal to the lowest county income tax rate set by any\nMaryland county.” §10–106.1. Maryland does not tax the\nincome that nonresidents earn from sources outside Mary­\nland. See §10–210.\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

In 2006, the relevant tax year, Brian Wynne\nowned stock in Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc., a Sub-\nchapter S corporation.1 That year, Maxim earned income\nin States other than Maryland, and it filed state income\ntax returns in 39 States. The Wynnes earned income\npassed through to them from Maxim. On their 2006 Mary­\nland tax return, the Wynnes claimed an income tax credit\nfor income taxes paid to other States.\n   Petitioner, the Maryland State Comptroller of the\nTreasury, denied this claim and assessed a tax deficiency.\nIn accordance with Maryland law, the Comptroller allowed\nthe Wynnes a credit against their Maryland “state” income\ntax but not against their “county” income tax. The Hear­\nings and Appeals Section of the Comptroller’s Office\nslightly modified the assessment but otherwise affirmed.\nThe Maryland Tax Court also affirmed, but the Circuit\nCourt for Howard County reversed on the ground that\nMaryland’s tax system violated the Commerce Clause.\n   The Court of Appeals of Maryland affirmed. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">147</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64 A. 3d 453.

By contrast, C corporations—organized under Sub-\nchapter C rather than S of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code—\nmust pay their own taxes because they are considered to be separate\ntax entities from their shareholders. 14A W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of\nthe Law of Corporations §§6971, 6973 (rev. ed. 2008 and Cum. Supp.\n2014–2015). Because of limitations on the number and type of share­\nholders they may have, S corporations tend to be smaller, more closely\nheld corporations. Id., §§7025.50, 7026.\n4      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 274 (1977), which asks whether a “tax is applied to\nan activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State,\nis fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against inter­\nstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services pro­\nvided by the State.” Id., at 279. The Court of Appeals\nheld that the tax failed both the fair apportionment and\nnondiscrimination parts of the Complete Auto test. With\nrespect to fair apportionment, the court first held that the\ntax failed the “internal consistency” test because if every\nState adopted Maryland’s tax scheme, interstate com­\nmerce would be taxed at a higher rate than intrastate\ncommerce. It then held that the tax failed the “external\nconsistency” test because it created a risk of multiple\ntaxation. With respect to nondiscrimination, the court\nheld that the tax discriminated against interstate com­\nmerce because it denied residents a credit on income taxes\npaid to other States and so taxed income earned interstate\nat a rate higher than income earned intrastate. The court\nthus concluded that Maryland’s tax scheme was unconsti­\ntutional insofar as it denied the Wynnes a credit against\nthe “county” tax for income taxes they paid to other States.\nTwo judges dissented and argued that the tax did not\nviolate the Commerce Clause. The Court of Appeals later\nissued a brief clarification that “[a] state may avoid dis­\ncrimination against interstate commerce by providing a\ntax credit, or some other method of apportionment, to\navoid discriminating against interstate commerce in viola­\ntion of the dormant Commerce Clause.” 431 Md., at 189,\n64 A. 3d at 478.\n   We granted certiorari. 572 U.

S. 322, 325–326 (1979). Although the\nClause is framed as a positive grant of power to Congress,\n“we have consistently held this language to contain a\nfurther, negative command, known as the dormant Com­\nmerce Clause, prohibiting certain state taxation even\nwhen Congress has failed to legislate on the subject.”\nOklahoma Tax Comm’n v.

Madison).\n   Under our precedents, the dormant Commerce Clause\n6      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprecludes States from “discriminat[ing] between transac­\ntions on the basis of some interstate element.” Boston\nStock Exchange v. State Tax Comm’n, 429 U. S. 318, 332,\nn. 12 (1977). This means, among other things, that a\nState “may not tax a transaction or incident more heavily\nwhen it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirely\nwithin the State.” Armco Inc. v. Hardesty, 467 U. S. 638,\n642 (1984). “Nor may a State impose a tax which discrim­\ninates against interstate commerce either by providing a\ndirect commercial advantage to local business, or by sub­\njecting interstate commerce to the burden of ‘multiple\ntaxation.’ ” Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v.\nMinnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 458 (1959) (citations omitted).\n                              B\n   Our existing dormant Commerce Clause cases all but\ndictate the result reached in this case by Maryland’s high­\nest court. Three cases involving the taxation of the income\nof domestic corporations are particularly instructive.\n   In J. D. Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, 304 U. S. 307 (1938),\nIndiana taxed the income of every Indiana resident (in­\ncluding individuals) and the income that every nonresi­\ndent derived from sources within Indiana. Id., at 308.\nThe State levied the tax on income earned by the plaintiff\nIndiana corporation on sales made out of the State. Id., at\n309. Holding that this scheme violated the dormant\nCommerce Clause, we explained that the “vice of the\nstatute” was that it taxed, “without apportionment, re­\nceipts derived from activities in interstate commerce.” Id.,\nat 311. If these receipts were also taxed by the States in\nwhich the sales occurred, we warned, interstate commerce\nwould be subjected “to the risk of a double tax burden to\nwhich intrastate commerce is not exposed, and which the\ncommerce clause forbids.” Ibid.\n   The next year, in Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v.\nHenneford, 305 U. S. 434 (1939), we reached a similar\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresult. In that case, the State of Washington taxed all the\nincome of persons doing business in the State. Id., at 435.\nWashington levied that tax on income that the plaintiff\nWashington corporation earned in shipping fruit from\nWashington to other States and foreign countries. Id., at\n436–437. This tax, we wrote, “discriminates against inter­\nstate commerce, since it imposes upon it, merely because\ninterstate commerce is being done, the risk of a multiple\nburden to which local commerce is not exposed.” Id., at\n439.\n   In the third of these cases involving the taxation of a\ndomestic corporation, Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v.\nMealey, 334 U. S. 653 (1948), New York sought to tax the\nportion of a domiciliary bus company’s gross receipts that\nwere derived from services provided in neighboring States.\nId., at 660; see also id., at 665 (Murphy, J., dissenting)\n(stating that the plaintiff was a New York corporation).\nNoting that these other States might also attempt to tax\nthis portion of the company’s gross receipts, the Court held\nthat the New York scheme violated the dormant Com­\nmerce Clause because it imposed an “unfair burden” on\ninterstate commerce. Id., at 662 (majority opinion).\n   In all three of these cases, the Court struck down a state\ntax scheme that might have resulted in the double taxa­\ntion of income earned out of the State and that discrimi­\nnated in favor of intrastate over interstate economic activ­\nity. As we will explain, see Part II–F, infra, Maryland’s\ntax scheme is unconstitutional for similar reasons.\n                            C\n  The principal dissent distinguishes these cases on the\nsole ground that they involved a tax on gross receipts\nrather than net income. We see no reason why the dis­\ntinction between gross receipts and net income should\nmatter, particularly in light of the admonition that we\nmust consider “not the formal language of the tax statute\n8      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut rather its practical effect.” Complete Auto, 430 U. S.,\nat 279. The principal dissent claims, post, at 13 (opinion\nof GINSBURG, J.), that “[t]he Court, historically, has taken\nthe position that the difference between taxes on net\nincome and taxes on gross receipts from interstate com­\nmerce warrants different results.” 2 C. Trost & P. Hart­\nman, Federal Limitations on State and Local Taxation 2d\n§10:1, p. 251 (2003) (emphasis added) (hereinafter Trost).\nBut this historical point is irrelevant. As the principal\ndissent seems to acknowledge, our cases rejected this\nformal distinction some time ago. And the distinction\nbetween gross receipts and net income taxes was not the\nbasis for our decisions in J. D. Adams, Gwin, White, and\nCentral Greyhound, which turned instead on the threat of\nmultiple taxation.\n   The discarded distinction between taxes on gross re­\nceipts and net income was based on the notion, endorsed\nin some early cases, that a tax on gross receipts is an\nimpermissible “direct and immediate burden” on inter­\nstate commerce, whereas a tax on net income is merely an\n“indirect and incidental” burden. United States Glue Co.\nv. Town of Oak Creek, 247 U. S. 321, 328–329 (1918); see\nalso Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U. S. 37, 57 (1920). This arid\ndistinction between direct and indirect burdens allowed\n“very little coherent, trustworthy guidance as to tax valid­\nity.” 2 Trost §9:1, at 212. And so, beginning with Justice\nStone’s seminal opinion in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of\nRevenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938), and continuing through\ncases like J. D. Adams and Gwin, White, the direct-\nindirect burdens test was replaced with a more practical\napproach that looked to the economic impact of the tax.\nThese cases worked “a substantial judicial reinterpreta­\ntion of the power of the States to levy taxes on gross in­\ncome from interstate commerce.” 1 Trost §2:20, at 175.\n   After a temporary reversion to our earlier formalism,\nsee Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O’Connor, 340 U. S. 602\n                    Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(1951), “the gross receipts judicial pendulum has swung in\na wide arc, recently reaching the place where taxation of\ngross receipts from interstate commerce is placed on an\nequal footing with receipts from local business, in Com-\nplete Auto Transit Inc. v. Brady,” 2 Trost §9:1, at 212. And\nwe have now squarely rejected the argument that the\nCommerce Clause distinguishes between taxes on net and\ngross income. See Jefferson Lines, 514 U. S., at 190 (ex­\nplaining that the Court in Central Greyhound “understood\nthe gross receipts tax to be simply a variety of tax on\nincome”); Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 280\n(1978) (rejecting a suggestion that the Commerce Clause\ndistinguishes between gross receipts taxes and net income\ntaxes); id., at 281 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (“I agree with\nthe Court that, for purposes of constitutional review, there\nis no distinction between a corporate income tax and a\ngross-receipts tax”); Complete Auto, supra, at 280 (uphold­\ning a gross receipts tax and rejecting the notion that the\nCommerce Clause places “a blanket prohibition against\nany state taxation imposed directly on an interstate\ntransaction”).2\n  For its part, petitioner distinguishes J. D. Adams, Gwin,\nWhite, and Central Greyhound on the ground that they\nconcerned the taxation of corporations, not individuals.\nBut it is hard to see why the dormant Commerce Clause\nshould treat individuals less favorably than corporations.\n——————\n  2 The principal dissent mischaracterizes the import of the Court’s\nstatement in Moorman that a gross receipts tax is “ ‘more burdensome’ ”\nthan a net income tax. Post, at 13. This was a statement about the\nrelative economic impact of the taxes (a gross receipts tax applies\nregardless of whether the corporation makes a profit). It was not, as\nJustice Brennan confirmed in dissent, a suggestion that net income\ntaxes are subject to lesser constitutional scrutiny than gross receipts\ntaxes. Indeed, we noted in Moorman that “the actual burden on inter­\nstate commerce would have been the same had Iowa imposed a plainly\nvalid gross-receipts tax instead of the challenged [net] income tax.”\nMoorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 280–281 (1978).\n10     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Camps Newfound, 520 U. S., at 574 (“A tax on real\nestate, like any other tax, may impermissibly burden\ninterstate commerce” (emphasis added)). In addition, the\ndistinction between individuals and corporations cannot\nstand because the taxes invalidated in J. D. Adams and\nGwin, White applied to the income of both individuals and\ncorporations. See Ind. Stat. Ann., ch. 26, §64–2602 (Burns\n1933) (tax in J. D. Adams); 1935 Wash. Sess. Laws ch.\n180, Tit. II, §4(e), pp. 710–711 (tax in Gwin, White).\n   Attempting to explain why the dormant Commerce\nClause should provide less protection for natural persons\nthan for corporations, petitioner and the Solicitor General\nargue that States should have a free hand to tax their\nresidents’ out-of-state income because States provide their\nresidents with many services. As the Solicitor General\nputs it, individuals “reap the benefits of local roads, local\npolice and fire protection, local public schools, [and] local\nhealth and welfare benefits.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 30.\n   This argument fails because corporations also benefit\nheavily from state and local services. Trucks hauling a\ncorporation’s supplies and goods, and vehicles transport­\ning its employees, use local roads. Corporations call upon\nlocal police and fire departments to protect their facilities.\nCorporations rely on local schools to educate prospective\nemployees, and the availability of good schools and other\ngovernment services are features that may aid a corpora­\ntion in attracting and retaining employees. Thus, dispar­\nate treatment of corporate and personal income cannot be\njustified based on the state services enjoyed by these two\ngroups of taxpayers.\n   The sole remaining attribute that, in the view of peti­\ntioner, distinguishes a corporation from an individual for\npresent purposes is the right of the individual to vote. The\nprincipal dissent also emphasizes that residents can vote\nto change Maryland’s discriminatory tax law. Post, at 3–4.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nThe argument is that this Court need not be concerned\nabout state laws that burden the interstate activities of\nindividuals because those individuals can lobby and vote\nagainst legislators who support such measures. But if a\nState’s tax unconstitutionally discriminates against inter­\nstate commerce, it is invalid regardless of whether the\nplaintiff is a resident voter or nonresident of the State.\nThis Court has thus entertained and even sustained\ndormant Commerce Clause challenges by individual resi­\ndents of the State that imposed the alleged burden on\ninterstate commerce, Department of Revenue of Ky. v.\nDavis, 553 U. S. 328, 336 (2008); Granholm v. Heald, 544\nU. S. 460, 469 (2005), and we have also sustained such a\nchallenge to a tax whose burden was borne by in-state\nconsumers, Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263,\n272 (1984).3\n  The principal dissent and JUSTICE SCALIA respond to\nthese holdings by relying on dictum in Goldberg v. Sweet,\n488 U. S. 252, 266 (1989), that it is not the purpose of the\ndormant Commerce Clause “ ‘to protect state residents\nfrom their own state taxes.’ ” Post, at 3 (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting); post, at 5 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But we\nrepudiated that dictum in West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v.\nHealy, 512 U. S. 186 (1994), where we stated that “[s]tate\ntaxes are ordinarily paid by in-state businesses and con­\nsumers, yet if they discriminate against out-of-state prod­\nucts, they are unconstitutional.” Id., at 203. And, of\ncourse, the dictum must bow to the holdings of our many\ncases entertaining Commerce Clause challenges brought\n——————\n  3 Similarly, we have sustained dormant Commerce Clause challenges\n\nby corporate residents of the State that imposed the burden on inter­\nstate commerce. See, e.g., Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of\nHarrison, 520 U. S. 564, 567 (1997); Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S.\n325, 328 (1996); Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 334 U. S. 653,\n654 (1948); Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 305 U. S. 434, 435\n(1939); J. D. Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, 304 U. S. 307, 308 (1938).\n12     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nby residents. We find the dissents’ reliance on Goldberg’s\ndictum particularly inappropriate since they do not find\nthemselves similarly bound by the rule of that case, which\napplied the internal consistency test to determine whether\nthe tax at issue violated the dormant Commerce Clause.\n488 U. S., at 261.\n   In addition, the notion that the victims of such discrimi­\nnation have a complete remedy at the polls is fanciful. It\nis likely that only a distinct minority of a State’s residents\nearns income out of State. Schemes that discriminate\nagainst income earned in other States may be attractive\nto legislators and a majority of their constituents for pre­\ncisely this reason. It is even more farfetched to suggest that\nnatural persons with out-of-state income are better able to\ninfluence state lawmakers than large corporations head­\nquartered in the State. In short, petitioner’s argument\nwould leave no security where the majority of voters prefer\nprotectionism at the expense of the few who earn income\ninterstate.\n   It would be particularly incongruous in the present case\nto disregard our prior decisions regarding the taxation of\ncorporate income because the income at issue here is a\ntype of corporate income, namely, the income of a Sub-\nchapter S corporation. Only small businesses may incor­\nporate under Subchapter S, and thus acceptance of peti­\ntioner’s submission would provide greater protection for\nincome earned by large Subchapter C corporations than\nsmall businesses incorporated under Subchapter S.\n                             D\n   In attempting to justify Maryland’s unusual tax scheme,\nthe principal dissent argues that the Commerce Clause\nimposes no limit on Maryland’s ability to tax the income of\nits residents, no matter where that income is earned. It\nargues that Maryland has the sovereign power to tax all of\nthe income of its residents, wherever earned, and it there­\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfore reasons that the dormant Commerce Clause cannot\nconstrain Maryland’s ability to expose its residents (and\nnonresidents) to the threat of double taxation.\n  This argument confuses what a State may do without\nviolating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment with what it may do without violating the\nCommerce Clause. The Due Process Clause allows a State\nto tax “all the income of its residents, even income earned\noutside the taxing jurisdiction.” Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v.\nChickasaw Nation, 515 U. S. 450, 462–463 (1995). But\n“while a State may, consistent with the Due Process\nClause, have the authority to tax a particular taxpayer,\nimposition of the tax may nonetheless violate the Com­\nmerce Clause.” Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U. S.\n298, 305 (1992) (rejecting a due process challenge to a tax\nbefore sustaining a Commerce Clause challenge to that\ntax).\n  Our decision in Camps Newfound illustrates the point.\nThere, we held that the Commerce Clause prohibited\nMaine from granting more favorable tax treatment to\ncharities that operated principally for the benefit of Maine\nresidents. 520 U. S., at 580–583. Because the plaintiff\ncharity in that case was a Maine nonprofit corporation,\nthere is no question that Maine had the raw jurisdictional\npower to tax the charity. See Chickasaw Nation, supra, at\n462–463. Nonetheless, the tax failed scrutiny under the\nCommerce Clause. Camps Newfound, supra, at 580–581.\nSimilarly, Maryland’s raw power to tax its residents’ out­\nof-state income does not insulate its tax scheme from\nscrutiny under the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  Although the principal dissent claims the mantle of\nprecedent, it is unable to identify a single case that en­\ndorses its essential premise, namely, that the Commerce\nClause places no constraint on a State’s power to tax the\nincome of its residents wherever earned. This is unsur­\nprising. As cases like Quill Corp. and Camps Newfound\n14     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrecognize, the fact that a State has the jurisdictional\npower to impose a tax says nothing about whether that tax\nviolates the Commerce Clause. See also, e.g., Barclays\nBank PLC v. Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal., 512 U. S. 298\n(1994) (separately addressing due process and Commerce\nClause challenges to a tax); Moorman, 437 U. S. 267\n(same); Standard Pressed Steel Co. v. Department of Reve-\nnue of Wash., 419 U. S. 560 (1975) (same); Lawrence v.\nState Tax Comm’n of Miss., 286 U. S. 276 (1932) (separately\naddressing due process and equal protection challenges\nto a tax); Travis v. Yale & Towne Mfg. Co., 252 U. S. 60\n(1920) (separately addressing due process and privileges­\nand-immunities challenges to a tax).\n   One good reason why we have never accepted the prin­\ncipal dissent’s logic is that it would lead to plainly untena­\nble results. Imagine that Maryland taxed the income that\nits residents earned in other States but exempted income\nearned out of State from any business that primarily\nserved Maryland residents. Such a tax would violate the\ndormant Commerce Clause, see Camps Newfound, supra,\nand it cannot be saved by the principal dissent’s admoni­\ntion that Maryland has the power to tax all the income of\nits residents. There is no principled difference between\nthat hypothetical Commerce Clause challenge and this\none.\n   The principal dissent, if accepted, would work a sea\nchange in our Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Legion\nare the cases in which we have considered and even up­\nheld dormant Commerce Clause challenges brought by\nresidents to taxes that the State had the jurisdictional\npower to impose. See, e.g., Davis, 553 U. S. 328; Camps\nNewfound, 520 U. S. 564; Fulton Corp., 516 U. S. 325;\nBacchus Imports, 468 U. S. 263; Central Greyhound, 334\nU. S. 653; Gwin, White, 305 U. S. 434; J. D. Adams, 304\nU. S. 307. If the principal dissent were to prevail, all of\nthese cases would be thrown into doubt. After all, in those\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncases, as here, the State’s decision to tax in a way that\nallegedly discriminates against interstate commerce could\nbe justified by the argument that a State may tax its\nresidents without any Commerce Clause constraints.\n                               E\n   While the principal dissent claims that we are departing\nfrom principles that have been accepted for “a century”\nand have been “repeatedly acknowledged by this Court,”\nsee post, at 1, 2, 19, when it comes to providing supporting\nauthority for this assertion, it cites exactly two Commerce\nClause decisions that are supposedly inconsistent with our\ndecision today. One is a summary affirmance, West Pub-\nlishing Co. v. McColgan, 328 U. S. 823 (1946), and neither\nactually supports the principal dissent’s argument.\n   In the first of these cases, Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U. S.\n37, a resident of Illinois who earned income from oil in\nOklahoma unsuccessfully argued that his Oklahoma\nincome tax assessment violated several provisions of the\nFederal Constitution. His main argument was based on\ndue process, but he also raised a dormant Commerce\nClause challenge. Although the principal dissent relies on\nShaffer for the proposition that a State may tax the in­\ncome of its residents wherever earned, Shaffer did not\nreject the Commerce Clause challenge on that basis.\n   The dormant Commerce Clause challenge in Shaffer\nwas nothing like the Wynnes’ challenge here. The tax-\npayer in Shaffer argued that “[i]f the tax is considered an\nexcise tax on business, rather than an income tax proper,”\nit unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce. Brief\nfor Appellant, O. T. 1919, No. 531, p. 166. The taxpayer\ndid not argue that this burden occurred because he was\nsubject to double taxation; instead, he argued that the tax\nwas an impermissible direct “tax on interstate business.”\nIbid. That argument was based on the notion that States\nmay not impose a tax “directly” on interstate commerce.\n16     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee supra, at 8–9. After assuming that the taxpayer’s\nbusiness was engaged in interstate commerce, we held\nthat “it is sufficient to say that the tax is imposed not upon\nthe gross receipts, but only upon the net proceeds, and is\nplainly sustainable, even if it includes net gains from\ninterstate commerce. [United States Glue Co. v. Town of\nOak Creek], 247 U. S. 321.” Shaffer, supra, at 57 (citation\nomitted).\n  Shaffer thus did not adjudicate anything like the double\ntaxation argument that was accepted in later cases and is\nbefore us today. And the principal dissent’s suggestion\nthat Shaffer allows States to levy discriminatory net\nincome taxes is refuted by a case decided that same day.\nIn Travis, a Connecticut corporation challenged New\nYork’s net income tax, which allowed residents, but not\nnonresidents, certain tax exemptions. The Court first\nrejected the taxpayer’s due process argument as “settled\nby our decision in Shaffer.” 252 U. S., at 75. But that due\nprocess inquiry was not the end of the matter: the Court\nthen separately considered—and sustained—the argu­\nment that the net income tax’s disparate treatment of\nresidents and nonresidents violated the Privileges and\nImmunities Clause. Id., at 79–80.\n  The second case on which the principal dissent relies,\nWest Publishing, is a summary affirmance and thus has\n“considerably less precedential value than an opinion on\nthe merits.” Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers\nParty, 440 U. S. 173, 180–181 (1979). A summary affir­\nmance “ ‘is not to be read as a renunciation by this Court of\ndoctrines previously announced in our opinions after full\nargument.’ ” Mandel v. Bradley, 432 U. S. 173, 176 (1977)\n(per curiam) (quoting Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U. S. 379,\n392 (1975) (Burger, C. J., concurring)). The principal\ndissent’s reliance on the state-court decision below in that\ncase is particularly inappropriate because “a summary\naffirmance is an affirmance of the judgment only,” and\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“the rationale of the affirmance may not be gleaned solely\nfrom the opinion below.” 432 U. S., at 176.\n   Moreover, we do not disagree with the result of West\nPublishing. The tax in that case was levied only on “ ‘the\nnet income of every corporation derived from sources\nwithin this State,’ ” and thus was an internally consistent\nand nondiscriminatory tax scheme. See West Publishing\nCo. v. McColgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613053\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613053/west-publishing-co-v-mccolgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 707, n., 166 P. 2d 861,\n862, n. (1946) (emphasis added). Moreover, even if we did\ndisagree with the result, the citation in our summary\naffirmance to United States Glue Co. suggests that our\ndecision was based on the since-discarded distinction\nbetween net income and gross receipts taxes. West Pub-\nlishing did not—indeed, it could not—repudiate the double\ntaxation cases upon which we rely.\n   The principal dissent also finds it significant that, when\nStates first enacted modern income taxes in the early\n1900’s, some States had tax schemes similar to Mary­\nland’s. This practice, however, was by no means univer­\nsal. A great many States—such as Alabama, Colorado,\nGeorgia, Kentucky, and Maryland—had early income tax\nschemes that allowed their residents a credit against taxes\npaid to other States. See Ala. Code, Tit. 51, ch. 17, §390\n(1940); Colo. Stat. Ann., ch. 84A, §38 (Cum. Supp. 1951);\nGa. Code Ann. §92–3111 (1974); Carroll’s Ky. Stat. Ann.,\nch. 108, Art. XX, §4281b–15 (Baldwin rev. 1936); Md. Ann.\nCode, Art. 81, ch. 277, §231 (1939). Other States also\nadopted internally consistent tax schemes. For example,\nMassachusetts and Utah taxed only the income of resi­\ndents, not nonresidents. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 62\n(1932); Utah Rev. Stat. §80–14–1 et seq. (1933).\n   In any event, it is hardly surprising that these early\nstate ventures into the taxation of income included some\nprotectionist regimes that favored the local economy over\ninterstate commerce. What is much more significant is\nthat over the next century, as our Commerce Clause juris­\n18       COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprudence developed, the States have almost entirely\nabandoned that approach, perhaps in recognition of their\ndoubtful constitutionality. Today, the near-universal state\npractice is to provide credits against personal income taxes\nfor such taxes paid to other States. See 2 J. Hellerstein &\nW. Hellerstein, State Taxation, ¶20.10, pp. 20–163 to 20–\n164 (3d ed. 2003).4\n                             F\n                             1\n  As previously noted, the tax schemes held to be uncon­\nstitutional in J. D. Adams, Gwin, White, and Central\nGreyhound, had the potential to result in the discrimina­\ntory double taxation of income earned out of state and\ncreated a powerful incentive to engage in intrastate rather\nthan interstate economic activity. Although we did not\nuse the term in those cases, we held that those schemes\ncould be cured by taxes that satisfy what we have subse­\nquently labeled the “internal consistency” test. See Jeffer-\nson Lines, 514 U. S., at 185 (citing Gwin, White as a case\nrequiring internal consistency); see also 1 Trost §2:19, at\n122–123, and n. 160 (explaining that the internal con­\nsistency test has its origins in Western Live Stock, J. D.\nAdams, and Gwin, White). This test, which helps courts\nidentify tax schemes that discriminate against interstate\ncommerce, “looks to the structure of the tax at issue to see\nwhether its identical application by every State in the\nUnion would place interstate commerce at a disadvantage\n——————\n  4 There is no merit to petitioner’s argument that Maryland is free to\n\nadopt any tax scheme that is not actually intended to discriminate\nagainst interstate commerce. Reply Brief 7. The Commerce Clause\nregulates effects, not motives, and it does not require courts to inquire\ninto voters’ or legislators’ reasons for enacting a law that has a discrim­\ninatory effect. See, e.g., Associated Industries of Mo. v. Lohman, 511\nU. S. 641, 653 (1994); Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 626–\n627 (1978); Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432\nU.

S. 159, 169 (1983).\n   By hypothetically assuming that every State has the\nsame tax structure, the internal consistency test allows\ncourts to isolate the effect of a defendant State’s tax\nscheme. This is a virtue of the test because it allows\ncourts to distinguish between (1) tax schemes that inher­\nently discriminate against interstate commerce without\nregard to the tax policies of other States, and (2) tax\nschemes that create disparate incentives to engage in\ninterstate commerce (and sometimes result in double\ntaxation) only as a result of the interaction of two different\nbut nondiscriminatory and internally consistent schemes.\nSee Armco, supra, at 645–646; Moorman, 437 U. S., at\n277, n. 12; Brief for Tax Economists as Amici Curiae 23–\n24 (hereinafter Brief for Tax Economists); Brief for Mi­\nchael S.

The first category of\ntaxes is typically unconstitutional; the second is not.5 See\nArmco, supra, at 644–646; Moorman, supra, at 277, and\nn. 12. Tax schemes that fail the internal consistency test\nwill fall into the first category, not the second: “[A]ny\ncross-border tax disadvantage that remains after applica­\ntion of the [test] cannot be due to tax disparities”6 but is\ninstead attributable to the taxing State’s discriminatory\npolicies alone.\n——————\n  5 Our  cases have held that tax schemes may be invalid under the\ndormant Commerce Clause even absent a showing of actual double\ntaxation.

WYNNE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Neither petitioner nor the principal dissent questions\nthe economic bona fides of the internal consistency test.\nAnd despite its professed adherence to precedent, the\nprincipal dissent ignores the numerous cases in which we\nhave applied the internal consistency test in the past. The\ninternal consistency test was formally introduced more\nthan three decades ago, see Container Corp., supra, and it\nhas been invoked in no fewer than seven cases, invalidat­\ning the tax in three of those cases. See American Trucking\nAssns., Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 545 U. S. 429\n(2005);7 Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175; Goldberg, 488\n——————\n   7 The principal dissent and JUSTICE SCALIA inaccurately state that\n\nthe Court in American Trucking “conceded that a trucking tax ‘fail[ed]\nthe “internal consistency” test,’ but upheld the tax anyway.” Post, at 5\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting); see also post, at 14–15 (GINSBURG, J., dissent­\ning). The Court did not say that the tax in question “failed the ‘internal\nconsistency test.’ ” The Court wrote that this is what petitioner argued.\nSee American Trucking, 545 U. S., at 437. And the Court did not\nconcede that this was true. The tax in that case was a flat tax on any\ntruck that made point-to-point deliveries in Michigan. The tax there­\nfore fell on all trucks that made solely intrastate deliveries and some\nthat made interstate deliveries, namely, those that also made some\nintrastate deliveries. What the Court “concede[d]” was that “if all\nStates [adopted a similar tax], an interstate truck would have to pay\nfees totaling several hundred dollars, or even several thousand dollars,\nwere it to ‘top off’ its business by carrying local loads in many (or even\nall) other States.” Id., at 438 (emphasis added). But that was not the\nsame as a concession that the tax violated the internal consistency test.\n  The internal consistency test asks whether the adoption of a rule by\nall States “would place interstate commerce at a disadvantage as\ncompared with commerce intrastate.” Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v.\nJefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 185 (1995). Whether the Michigan\ntrucking tax had such an effect depended on an empirical showing that\npetitioners failed to make, namely, that the challenged tax imposed a\nheavier burden on interstate truckers in general than it did on intra­\nstate truckers. Under the Michigan tax, some interstate truckers, i.e.,\nthose who used Michigan roads solely for trips that started and ended\noutside the State, did not pay this tax even though they benefited from\nthe use of the State’s roads; they were thus treated more favorably than\ntruckers who did not leave the State. Other truckers who made inter­\n                      Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                    21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 252; American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483\nU. S. 266 (1987); Tyler Pipe, 483 U. S. 232; Armco, 467\nU. S. 638; Container Corp., supra.\n                             2\n  Maryland’s income tax scheme fails the internal con­\nsistency test.8 A simple example illustrates the point.\nAssume that every State imposed the following taxes,\nwhich are similar to Maryland’s “county” and “special\nnonresident” taxes: (1) a 1.25% tax on income that resi­\ndents earn in State, (2) a 1.25% tax on income that resi­\ndents earn in other jurisdictions, and (3) a 1.25% tax on\nincome that nonresidents earn in State. Assume further\nthat two taxpayers, April and Bob, both live in State A,\nbut that April earns her income in State A whereas Bob\nearns his income in State B. In this circumstance, Bob\n——————\nstate trips, i.e., those who made some intrastate trips, were treated less\nfavorably. As the United States explained in its brief, “[n]either record\nevidence nor abstract logic makes clear whether the overall effect of\nsuch a system would be to increase or to reduce existing financial\ndisincentives to interstate travel.” Brief for United States in American\nTrucking Assns., Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm’n, O. T. 2004, No.\n03–1230, p. 26.\n   8 In order to apply the internal consistency test in this case, we must\n\nevaluate the Maryland income tax scheme as a whole. That scheme\ntaxes three separate categories of income: (1) the “county tax” on\nincome that Maryland residents earn in Maryland; (2) the “county tax”\non income that Maryland residents earn in other States; and (3) the\n“special nonresident tax” on income that nonresidents earn in Mary­\nland. For Commerce Clause purposes, it is immaterial that Maryland\nassigns different labels (i.e., “county tax” and “special nonresident tax”)\nto these taxes. In applying the dormant Commerce Clause, they must\nbe considered as one. Cf. Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of\nEnvironmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 102–103 (1994) (independ­\nent taxes on intrastate and interstate commerce are “compensatory” if\nthey are rough equivalents imposed upon substantially similar events).\nIf state labels controlled, a State would always be free to tax domestic,\ninbound, and outbound income at discriminatory rates simply by\nattaching different labels.\n22     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwill pay more income tax than April solely because he\nearns income interstate. Specifically, April will have to\npay a 1.25% tax only once, to State A. But Bob will have\nto pay a 1.25% tax twice: once to State A, where he re­\nsides, and once to State B, where he earns the income.\n   Critically—and this dispels a central argument made by\npetitioner and the principal dissent—the Maryland\nscheme’s discriminatory treatment of interstate commerce\nis not simply the result of its interaction with the taxing\nschemes of other States. Instead, the internal consistency\ntest reveals what the undisputed economic analysis shows:\nMaryland’s tax scheme is inherently discriminatory and\noperates as a tariff. See Brief for Tax Economists 4, 9;\nBrief for Knoll & Mason 2. This identity between Mary­\nland’s tax and a tariff is fatal because tariffs are “[t]he\nparadigmatic example of a law discriminating against\ninterstate commerce.” West Lynn, 512 U. S., at 193.\nIndeed, when asked about the foregoing analysis made by\namici Tax Economists and Knoll & Mason, counsel for\nMaryland responded, “I don’t dispute the mathematics.\nThey lose me when they switch from tariffs to income\ntaxes.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 9. But Maryland has offered no\nreason why our analysis should change because we deal\nwith an income tax rather than a formal tariff, and we see\nnone. After all, “tariffs against the products of other\nStates are so patently unconstitutional that our cases\nreveal not a single attempt by any State to enact one.\nInstead, the cases are filled with state laws that aspire to\nreap some of the benefits of tariffs by other means.” West\nLynn, supra, at 193.\n   None of our dissenting colleagues dispute this economic\nanalysis. The principal dissent focuses instead on a sup­\nposed “oddity” with our analysis: The principal dissent can\nenvision other tax schemes that result in double taxation\nbut do not violate the internal consistency test. This\nwould happen, the principal dissent points out, if State A\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntaxed only based on residence and State B taxed only\nbased on source. Post, at 17 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting);\nsee also post, at 7 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Our prior\ndecisions have already considered and rejected this precise\nargument—and for good reason. For example, in Armco,\nwe struck down an internally inconsistent tax that posed a\nrisk of double taxation even though we recognized that\nthere might be other permissible arrangements that would\nresult in double taxation. Such schemes would be consti­\ntutional, we explained, because “such a result would not\narise from impermissible discrimination against interstate\ncommerce.” 467 U. S., at 645. The principal dissent’s\nprotest that our distinction is “entirely circular,” post, at\n17–18, n. 10, misunderstands the critical distinction,\nrecognized in cases like Armco, between discriminatory\ntax schemes and double taxation that results only from\nthe interaction of two different but nondiscriminatory tax\nschemes. See also Moorman, 437 U. S., at 277, n. 12\n(distinguishing “the potential consequences of the use of\ndifferent formulas by the two States,” which is not prohib­\nited by the Commerce Clause, from discrimination that\n“inhere[s] in either State’s formula,” which is prohibited).\n   Petitioner and the Solicitor General argue that Mary­\nland’s tax is neutral, not discriminatory, because the same\ntax applies to all three categories of income. Specifically,\nthey point out that the same tax is levied on (1) residents\nwho earn income in State, (2) residents who earn income\nout of State, and (3) nonresidents who earn income in\nState. But the fact that the tax might have “ ‘the ad­\nvantage of appearing nondiscriminatory’ does not save it\nfrom invalidation.” Tyler Pipe, 483 U. S., at 248 (quoting\nGeneral Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436, 460\n(1964) (Goldberg, J., dissenting)). See also American\nTrucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. at, 281\n(dormant Commerce Clause applies to state taxes even\nwhen they “do not allocate tax burdens between insiders\n24     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand outsiders in a manner that is facially discriminatory”);\nMaine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 138 (1986) (a state law\nmay discriminate against interstate commerce “ ‘either on\nits face or in practical effect’ ” (quoting Hughes, 441 U. S.,\nat 336)). In this case, the internal consistency test and\neconomic analysis—indeed, petitioner’s own concession—\nconfirm that the tax scheme operates as a tariff and dis­\ncriminates against interstate commerce, and so the\nscheme is invalid.\n   Petitioner and the principal dissent, post, at 6, also note\nthat by offering residents who earn income in interstate\ncommerce a credit against the “state” portion of the in­\ncome tax, Maryland actually receives less tax revenue\nfrom residents who earn income from interstate commerce\nrather than intrastate commerce. This argument is a red\nherring. The critical point is that the total tax burden on\ninterstate commerce is higher, not that Maryland may\nreceive more or less tax revenue from a particular tax­\npayer. See Armco, supra, at 642–645. Maryland’s tax un-\nconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce,\nand it is thus invalid regardless of how much a particular\ntaxpayer must pay to the taxing State.\n   Once again, a simple hypothetical illustrates the point.\nAssume that State A imposes a 5% tax on the income that\nits residents earn in-state but a 10% tax on income they\nearn in other jurisdictions. Assume also that State A\nhappens to grant a credit against income taxes paid to\nother States. Such a scheme discriminates against inter­\nstate commerce because it taxes income earned interstate\nat a higher rate than income earned intrastate. This is so\ndespite the fact that, in certain circumstances, a resident\nof State A who earns income interstate may pay less tax to\nState A than a neighbor who earns income intrastate. For\nexample, if Bob lives in State A but earns his income in\nState B, which has a 6% income tax rate, Bob would pay a\ntotal tax of 10% on his income, though 6% would go to\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nState B and (because of the credit) only 4% would go to\nState A. Bob would thus pay less to State A than his\nneighbor, April, who lives in State A and earns all of her\nincome there, because April would pay a 5% tax to State\nA. But Bob’s tax burden to State A is irrelevant; his total\ntax burden is what matters.\n   The principal dissent is left with two arguments against\nthe internal consistency test. These arguments are incon­\nsistent with each other and with our precedents.\n   First, the principal dissent claims that the analysis\noutlined above requires a State taxing based on residence\nto “recede” to a State taxing based on source. Post, at 1–2.\nWe establish no such rule of priority. To be sure, Mary­\nland could remedy the infirmity in its tax scheme by offer­\ning, as most States do, a credit against income taxes paid\nto other States. See Tyler Pipe, supra, at 245–246, and\nn. 13. If it did, Maryland’s tax scheme would survive the\ninternal consistency test and would not be inherently\ndiscriminatory. Tweak our first hypothetical, supra, at\n21–22, and assume that all States impose a 1.25% tax on\nall three categories of income but also allow a credit\nagainst income taxes that residents pay to other jurisdic­\ntions. In that circumstance, April (who lives and works in\nState A) and Bob (who lives in State A but works in State\nB) would pay the same tax. Specifically, April would pay a\n1.25% tax only once (to State A), and Bob would pay a\n1.25% tax only once (to State B, because State A would\ngive him a credit against the tax he paid to State B).\n   But while Maryland could cure the problem with its\ncurrent system by granting a credit for taxes paid to other\nStates, we do not foreclose the possibility that it could\ncomply with the Commerce Clause in some other way. See\nBrief for Tax Economists 32; Brief for Knoll & Mason 28–\n30. Of course, we do not decide the constitutionality of a\nhypothetical tax scheme that Maryland might adopt be­\ncause such a scheme is not before us. That Maryland’s\n26     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexisting tax unconstitutionally discriminates against\ninterstate commerce is enough to decide this case.\n   Second, the principal dissent finds a “deep flaw” with\nthe possibility that “Maryland could eliminate the incon­\nsistency [with its tax scheme] by terminating the special\nnonresident tax—a measure that would not help the\nWynnes at all.” Post, at 16. This second objection refutes\nthe first. By positing that Maryland could remedy the\nunconstitutionality of its tax scheme by eliminating the\nspecial nonresident tax, the principal dissent accepts that\nMaryland’s desire to tax based on residence need not\n“recede” to another State’s desire to tax based on source.\n   Moreover, the principal dissent’s supposed flaw is simply\na truism about every case under the dormant Commerce\nClause (not to mention the Equal Protection Clause):\nWhenever government impermissibly treats like cases\ndifferently, it can cure the violation by either “leveling up”\nor “leveling down.” Whenever a State impermissibly taxes\ninterstate commerce at a higher rate than intrastate\ncommerce, that infirmity could be cured by lowering the\nhigher rate, raising the lower rate, or a combination of the\ntwo. For this reason, we have concluded that “a State\nfound to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory\ntax retains flexibility in responding to this determination.”\nMcKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and\nTobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18,\n39–40 (1990). See also Associated Industries of Mo. v.\nLohman, 511 U. S. 641, 656 (1994); Fulton Corp., 516\nU. S., at 346–347. If every claim that suffers from this\n“flaw” cannot succeed, no dormant Commerce Clause or\nequal protection claim could ever succeed.\n                              G\n  JUSTICE SCALIA would uphold the constitutionality of\nthe Maryland tax scheme because the dormant Commerce\nClause, in his words, is “a judicial fraud.” Post, at 2. That\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas not the view of the Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9\nWheat, at 209, where Chief Justice Marshall wrote that\nthere was “great force” in the argument that the Com­\nmerce Clause by itself limits the power of the States to\nenact laws regulating interstate commerce. Since that\ntime, this supposedly fraudulent doctrine has been applied\nin dozens of our opinions, joined by dozens of Justices.\nPerhaps for this reason, petitioner in this case, while\nchallenging the interpretation and application of that\ndoctrine by the court below, did not ask us to reconsider\nthe doctrine’s validity.\n  JUSTICE SCALIA does not dispute the fact that State\ntariffs were among the principal problems that led to the\nadoption of the Constitution. See post, at 3. Nor does he\ndispute the fact that the Maryland tax scheme is tanta­\nmount to a tariff on work done out of State. He argues,\nhowever, that the Constitution addresses the problem of\nstate tariffs by prohibiting States from imposing “ ‘Imposts\nor Duties on Imports or Exports.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Art. I,\n§10, cl. 2). But he does not explain why, under his inter­\npretation of the Constitution, the Import-Export Clause\nwould not lead to the same result that we reach under the\ndormant Commerce Clause. Our cases have noted the\nclose relationship between the two provisions. See, e.g.,\nState Tonnage Tax Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 214 (1871).\n  JUSTICE THOMAS also refuses to accept the dormant\nCommerce Clause doctrine, and he suggests that the\nConstitution was ratified on the understanding that it\nwould not prevent a State from doing what Maryland has\ndone here. He notes that some States imposed income\ntaxes at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, and\nhe observes that “[t]here is no indication that those early\nstate income tax schemes provided credits for income\ntaxes paid elsewhere.” Post, at 2 (dissenting opinion). “It\nseems highly implausible,” he writes, “that those who\nratified the Commerce Clause understood it to conflict\n28     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the income tax laws of their States and nonetheless\nadopted it without a word of concern.” Ibid. This argu­\nment is plainly unsound.\n   First, because of the difficulty of interstate travel, the\nnumber of individuals who earned income out of State in\n1787 was surely very small. (We are unaware of records\nshowing, for example, that it was common in 1787 for\nworkers to commute to Manhattan from New Jersey by\nrowboat or from Connecticut by stagecoach.)\n   Second, JUSTICE THOMAS has not shown that the small\nnumber of individuals who earned income out of State\nwere taxed twice on that income. A number of Founding-\nera income tax schemes appear to have taxed only the\nincome of residents, not nonresidents. For example, in his\nreport to Congress on direct taxes, Oliver Wolcott, Jr.,\nSecretary of Treasury, describes Delaware’s income tax as\nbeing imposed only on “the inhabitants of this State,” and\nhe makes no mention of the taxation of nonresidents’\nincome. Report to 4th Cong., 2d Sess. (1796), concerning\nDirect Taxes, in 1 American State Papers, Finance 429\n(1832). JUSTICE THOMAS likewise understands that the\nMassachusetts and Delaware income taxes were imposed\nonly on residents. Post, at 2, n. These tax schemes, of\ncourse, pass the internal consistency test. Moreover, the\ndifficulty of administering an income tax on nonresidents\nwould have diminished the likelihood of double taxation.\nSee R. Blakey, State Income Taxation 1 (1930).\n   Third, even if some persons were taxed twice, it is un­\nlikely that this was a matter of such common knowledge\nthat it must have been known by the delegates to the\nState ratifying conventions who voted to adopt the\nConstitution.\n                        *    *   *\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nof Maryland is affirmed.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

It does this by invoking the negative Com-\nmerce Clause, a judge-invented rule under which judges\nmay set aside state laws that they think impose too much\nof a burden upon interstate commerce. I join the principal\ndissent, which demonstrates the incompatibility of this\ndecision with our prior negative Commerce Clause cases.\nPost, at 2–14 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). Incompatibility,\nhowever, is not the test for me—though what is incompat-\nible with our cases a fortiori fails my test as well, as dis-\ncussed briefly in Part III below. The principal purpose of\nmy writing separately is to point out how wrong our nega-\ntive Commerce Clause jurisprudence is in the first place,\nand how well today’s decision illustrates its error.\n                            I\n  The fundamental problem with our negative Commerce\nClause cases is that the Constitution does not contain a\nnegative Commerce Clause. It contains only a Commerce\nClause. Unlike the negative Commerce Clause adopted by\nthe judges, the real Commerce Clause adopted by the\nPeople merely empowers Congress to “regulate Commerce\n2      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwith foreign Nations, and among the several States, and\nwith the Indian Tribes.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3. The Clause says\nnothing about prohibiting state laws that burden com-\nmerce. Much less does it say anything about authorizing\njudges to set aside state laws they believe burden com-\nmerce. The clearest sign that the negative Commerce\nClause is a judicial fraud is the utterly illogical holding\nthat congressional consent enables States to enact laws\nthat would otherwise constitute impermissible burdens\nupon interstate commerce. See Prudential Ins. Co. v.\nBenjamin, 328 U. S. 408, 421–427 (1946). How could\ncongressional consent lift a constitutional prohibition?\nSee License Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580 (1847) (opinion of\nTaney, C. J.).\n  The Court’s efforts to justify this judicial economic veto\ncome to naught. The Court claims that the doctrine “has\ndeep roots.” Ante, at 5. So it does, like many weeds. But\nage alone does not make up for brazen invention. And the\ndoctrine in any event is not quite as old as the Court\nmakes it seem. The idea that the Commerce Clause of its\nown force limits state power “finds no expression” in dis-\ncussions surrounding the Constitution’s ratification. F.\nFrankfurter, The Commerce Clause Under Marshall,\nTaney and Waite 13 (1937). For years after the adoption\nof the Constitution, States continually made regulations\nthat burdened interstate commerce (like pilotage laws and\nquarantine laws) without provoking any doubts about\ntheir constitutionality. License Cases, supra, at 580–581.\nThis Court’s earliest allusions to a negative Commerce\nClause came only in dicta—ambiguous dicta, at that—and\nwere vigorously contested at the time. See, e.g., id., at\n581–582. Our first clear holding setting aside a state law\nunder the negative Commerce Clause came after the Civil\nWar, more than 80 years after the Constitution’s adoption.\nCase of the State Freight Tax, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1873).

S. 298, 309 (1992). The negative Commerce Clause\napplied today has little in common with the negative\nCommerce Clause of the 19th century, except perhaps for\nincoherence.\n  The Court adds that “tariffs and other laws that bur-\ndened interstate commerce” were among “the chief evils\nthat led to the adoption of the Constitution.” Ante, at 5.\nThis line of reasoning forgets that interpretation requires\nheeding more than the Constitution’s purposes; it requires\nheeding the means the Constitution uses to achieve those\npurposes. The Constitution addresses the evils of local\nimpediments to commerce by prohibiting States from\nimposing certain especially burdensome taxes—“Imposts\nor Duties on Imports or Exports” and “Dut[ies] of Ton-\nnage”—without congressional consent. Art. I, §10, cls.\n2–3. It also addresses these evils by giving Congress a com-\nmerce power under which it may prohibit other burden-\nsome taxes and laws. As the Constitution’s text shows,\nhowever, it does not address these evils by empowering\nthe judiciary to set aside state taxes and laws that it\ndeems too burdensome. By arrogating this power anyway,\nour negative Commerce Clause cases have disrupted the\nbalance the Constitution strikes between the goal of pro-\ntecting commerce and competing goals like preserving\nlocal autonomy and promoting democratic responsibility.\n                            II\n  The failings of negative Commerce Clause doctrine go\nbeyond its lack of a constitutional foundation, as today’s\ndecision well illustrates.\n\n   1. One glaring defect of the negative Commerce Clause\nis its lack of governing principle. Neither the Constitution\nnor our legal traditions offer guidance about how to sepa-\n4      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v.

So\nwe must make the rules up as we go along. That is how\nwe ended up with the bestiary of ad hoc tests and ad hoc\nexceptions that we apply nowadays, including the sub-\nstantial nexus test, the fair apportionment test, and the\nfair relation test, Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady,\n430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977), the interest-on-state-bonds\nexception, Department of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis, 553\nU. S. 328, 353–356 (2008), and the sales-taxes-on-mail-\norders exception, Quill Corp., supra, at 314–319.\n   The internal consistency rule invoked by the Court\nnicely showcases our ad hocery. Under this rule, a tax\nviolates the Constitution if its hypothetical adoption by all\nStates would interfere with interstate commerce. Ante, at\n19. How did this exercise in counterfactuals find its way\ninto our basic charter? The test, it is true, bears some\nresemblance to Kant’s first formulation of the categorical\nimperative: “Act only according to that maxim whereby\nyou can at the same time will that it should become a\nuniversal law” without contradiction. Grounding for the\nMetaphysics of Morals 30 (J. Ellington transl. 3d ed.\n1993). It bears no resemblance, however, to anything in\nthe text or structure of the Constitution. Nor can one\ndiscern an obligation of internal consistency from our legal\ntraditions, which show that States have been imposing\ninternally inconsistent taxes for quite a while—until\nrecently with our approval. See, e.g., General Motors\nCorp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436 (1964) (upholding\ninternally inconsistent business activities tax); Hinson v.\nLott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1869) (upholding internally inconsistent\nliquor tax). No, the only justification for the test seems to\nbe that this Court disapproves of “ ‘cross-border tax disad-\nvantage[s]’ ” when created by internally inconsistent taxes,\nbut is willing to tolerate them when created by “the inter-\naction of . . . internally consistent schemes.” Ante, at 19.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)              5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n“Whatever it is we are expounding in this area, it is not\na Constitution.”    American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.\nSmith, 496 U. S. 167, 203 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment).\n\n   2. Another conspicuous feature of the negative Com-\nmerce Clause is its instability. Because no principle an-\nchors our development of this doctrine—and because the\nline between wise regulation and burdensome interference\nchanges from age to economic age—one can never tell\nwhen the Court will make up a new rule or throw away an\nold one. “Change is almost [the doctrine’s] natural state,\nas it is the natural state of legislation in a constantly\nchanging national economy.” Ibid.\n   Today’s decision continues in this proud tradition.\nConsider a few ways in which it contradicts earlier\ndecisions:\n   In an earlier case, the Court conceded that a trucking\n    tax “fail[ed] the ‘internal consistency’ test,” but upheld\n    the tax anyway. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.\n    Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 545 U. S. 429, 437\n    (2005). Now, the Court proclaims that an income tax\n    “fails the internal consistency test,” and for that rea-\n    son strikes it down. Ante, at 21.\n   In an earlier case, the Court concluded that “[i]t is not\n    a purpose of the Commerce Clause to protect state\n    residents from their own state taxes” and that resi-\n    dents could “complain about and change the tax\n    through the [State’s] political process.” Goldberg v.\n    Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 266 (1989). Now, the Court con-\n    cludes that the negative Commerce Clause operates\n    “regardless of whether the plaintiff is a resident . . . or\n    nonresident” and that “the notion that [residents]\n    have a complete remedy at the polls is fanciful.” Ante,\n    at 11, 12.\n6        COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n     In an earlier case, the Court said that “[t]he difference\n      in effect between a tax measured by gross receipts\n      and one measured by net income . . . is manifest and\n      substantial.” United States Glue Co. v. Town of Oak\n      Creek, 247 U. S. 321, 328 (1918). Now, the Court says\n      that the “formal distinction” between taxes on net and\n      gross income “should [not] matter.” Ante, at 7.\n     In an earlier case, the Court upheld a tax despite its\n      economic similarity to the gross-receipts tax struck\n      down in Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 334\n      U. S. 653 (1948). Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Jefferson\n      Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 190–191 (1995). The Court\n      explained that “economic equivalence alone has . . .\n      not been (and should not be) the touchstone of Com-\n      merce Clause jurisprudence.” Id., at 196–197, n. 7.\n      Now, the Court strikes down a tax in part because of\n      its economic similarity to the gross-receipts tax struck\n      down in Central Greyhound. Ante, at 7. The Court\n      explains that “we must consider ‘not the formal lan-\n      guage of the tax statute but rather its practical ef-\n      fect.’ ” Ante, at 7–8.\n    So much for internal consistency.\n\n   3. A final defect of our Synthetic Commerce Clause\ncases is their incompatibility with the judicial role. The\ndoctrine does not call upon us to perform a conventional\njudicial function, like interpreting a legal text, discerning\na legal tradition, or even applying a stable body of prece-\ndents. It instead requires us to balance the needs of com-\nmerce against the needs of state governments. That is a\ntask for legislators, not judges.\n   Today’s enterprise of eliminating double taxation puts\nthis problem prominently on display. The one sure way to\neliminate all double taxation is to prescribe uniform na-\ntional tax rules—for example, to allow taxation of income\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nonly where earned. But a program of prescribing a na-\ntional tax code plainly exceeds the judicial competence. (It\nmay even exceed the legislative competence to come up\nwith a uniform code that accounts for the many political\nand economic differences among the States.) As an alter-\nnative, we could consider whether a State’s taxes in prac-\ntice overlap too much with the taxes of other States. But\nany such approach would drive us “to the perplexing in-\nquiry, so unfit for the judicial department, what degree of\ntaxation is the legitimate use, and what degree may\namount to an abuse of power.” McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430 (1819). The Court today chooses a third\napproach, prohibiting States from imposing internally\ninconsistent taxes. Ante, at 19. But that rule avoids\ndouble taxation only in the hypothetical world where all\nStates adopt the same internally consistent tax, not in the\nreal world where different States might adopt different\ninternally consistent taxes. For example, if Maryland\nimposes its income tax on people who live in Maryland\nregardless of where they work (one internally consistent\nscheme), while Virginia imposes its income tax on people\nwho work in Virginia regardless of where they live (an-\nother internally consistent scheme), Marylanders who work\nin Virginia still face double taxation. Post, at 17–18.\nThen again, it is only fitting that the Imaginary Com-\nmerce Clause would lead to imaginary benefits.\n                             III\n  For reasons of stare decisis, I will vote to set aside a tax\nunder the negative Commerce Clause if (but only if) it\ndiscriminates on its face against interstate commerce or\ncannot be distinguished from a tax this Court has already\nheld unconstitutional. American Trucking Assns., 545\nU. S., at 439 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). The\nincome tax before us does not discriminate on its face\nagainst interstate commerce; a resident pays no less to\n8      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nMaryland when he works in Maryland than when he\nworks elsewhere. Neither is the tax before us indistin-\nguishable from one that we have previously held unconsti-\ntutional. To the contrary, as the principal dissent estab-\nlishes, our prior cases validate this tax.\n                         *  *     *\n  Maryland’s refusal to give residents full tax credits\nagainst income taxes paid to other States has its disad-\nvantages. It threatens double taxation and encourages\nresidents to work in Maryland. But Maryland’s law also\nhas its advantages. It allows the State to collect equal\nrevenue from taxpayers with equal incomes, avoids the\nadministrative burdens of verifying tax payments to other\nStates, and ensures that every resident pays the State at\nleast some income tax. Nothing in the Constitution pre-\ncludes Maryland from deciding that the benefits of its tax\nscheme are worth the costs.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

S. 564, 610–612 (1997)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting). For that reason, I would uphold\nMaryland’s tax scheme.\n   In reaching the contrary conclusion, the Court proves\njust how far our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence\nhas departed from the actual Commerce Clause. Accord-\ning to the majority, a state income tax that fails to provide\nresidents with “a full credit against the income taxes that\nthey pay to other States” violates the Commerce Clause.\nAnte, at 1. That news would have come as a surprise to\nthose who penned and ratified the Constitution. As this\nCourt observed some time ago, “Income taxes . . . were\nimposed by several of the States at or shortly after the\nadoption of the Federal Constitution.” Shaffer v. Carter,\n2       COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n252 U. S. 37, 51 (1920).* There is no indication that those\nearly state income tax schemes provided credits for income\ntaxes paid elsewhere. Thus, under the majority’s reason-\ning, all of those state laws would have contravened the\nnewly ratified Commerce Clause.\n   It seems highly implausible that those who ratified the\nCommerce Clause understood it to conflict with the in-\ncome tax laws of their States and nonetheless adopted it\nwithout a word of concern. That silence is particularly\ndeafening given the importance of such taxes for raising\nrevenues at the time. See Kinsman, The Income Tax in\nthe Commonwealths of the United States 7, in 4 Publica-\ntions of the American Economic Assn. (1903) (noting, for\nexample, that “Connecticut from her earliest history had\nfollowed the plan of taxing incomes rather than property”\nand that “[t]he total assessed value of [taxable] incomes in\nConnecticut in the year 1795 was a little over $300,000”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   In other areas of constitutional analysis, we would have\nconsidered these laws to be powerful evidence of the origi-\nnal understanding of the Constitution.

Chickasaw Nation, 515\nU. S. 450, 462–463 (1995). In accord with this principle,\nthe Court has regularly rejected claims that taxes on a\nresident’s out-of-state income violate the Due Process\nClause for lack of a sufficient “connection” to the taxing\nState. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U. S. 298, 306\n(1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Law-\nrence v. State Tax Comm’n of Miss., 286 U. S. 276, 281\n(1932). But under dormant Commerce Clause jurispru-\ndence, the Court decides, a State is not really empowered\nto tax a resident’s income from whatever source derived.\nIn taxing personal income, the Court holds, source-based\nauthority, i.e., authority to tax commerce conducted within\na State’s territory, boxes in the taxing authority of a tax-\npayer’s domicile.\n   As I see it, nothing in the Constitution or in prior deci-\nsions of this Court dictates that one of two States, the\ndomiciliary State or the source State, must recede simply\nbecause both have lawful tax regimes reaching the same\n2      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nincome. See Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267,\n277, n. 12 (1978) (finding no “discriminat[ion] against\ninterstate commerce” where alleged taxation disparities\nwere “the consequence of the combined effect” of two other-\nwise lawful income-tax schemes). True, Maryland elected\nto deny a credit for income taxes paid to other States in\ncomputing a resident’s county tax liability. It is equally\ntrue, however, that the other States that taxed the\nWynnes’ income elected not to offer them a credit for their\nMaryland county income taxes. In this situation, the\nConstitution does not prefer one lawful basis for state\ntaxation of a person’s income over the other. Nor does\nit require one State, in this case Maryland, to limit its\nresidence-based taxation, should the State also choose to\nexercise, to the full extent, its source-based authority.\nStates often offer their residents credits for income taxes\npaid to other States, as Maryland does for state income\ntax purposes. States do so, however, as a matter of tax\n“policy,” Chickasaw Nation, 515 U. S., at 463, n. 12 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted), not because the Constitu-\ntion compels that course.\n                              I\n   For at least a century, “domicile” has been recognized as\na secure ground for taxation of residents’ worldwide in-\ncome. Lawrence, 286 U. S., at 279. “Enjoyment of the\nprivileges of residence within [a] state, and the attendant\nright to invoke the protection of its laws,” this Court has\nexplained, “are inseparable from the responsibility for\nsharing the costs of government.” Ibid. “A tax measured\nby the net income of residents is an equitable method of\ndistributing the burdens of government among those who\nare privileged to enjoy its benefits.” New York ex rel. Cohn\nv. Graves, 300 U. S. 308, 313 (1937).\n   More is given to the residents of a State than to those\nwho reside elsewhere, therefore more may be demanded of\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

With this Court’s approbation, States have long\nfavored their residents over nonresidents in the provision\nof local services. See Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429,\n442 (1980) (such favoritism does not violate the Commerce\nClause). See also Martinez v. Bynum, 461 U. S. 321 (1983)\n(upholding residency requirements for free primary and\nsecondary schooling). The cost of services residents enjoy\nis substantial. According to the State’s Comptroller, for\nexample, in 2012 Maryland and its local governments\nspent over $11 billion to fund public schools, $4 billion for\nstate health programs, and $1.1 billion for the State’s food\nsupplemental program—all programs available to resi-\ndents only. Brief for Petitioner 20–23. See also Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 18 (Howard County—\nwhere the Wynnes lived in 2006—budgeted more than\n$903 million for education in fiscal year 2014). Excluding\nnonresidents from these services, this Court has observed,\nis rational for it is residents “who fund the state treasury\nand whom the State was created to serve.” Reeves, 447\nU. S., at 442. A taxpayer’s home State, then, can hardly\nbe faulted for making support of local government activi-\nties an obligation of every resident, regardless of any\nobligations residents may have to other States.1\n   Residents, moreover, possess political means, not shared\nby outsiders, to ensure that the power to tax their income\nis not abused. “It is not,” this Court has observed, “a\npurpose of the Commerce Clause to protect state residents\nfrom their own state taxes.” Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S.\n252, 266 (1989). The reason is evident.

But I fail to see how it answers, or is even\nrelevant to, my observation that affording residents greater benefits\nentitles a State to require that they bear a greater tax burden.\n4        COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v.

Nonresidents, by contrast, are not similarly posi-\ntioned to “effec[t] legislative change.” Ibid. As Chief\nJustice Marshall, developer of the Court’s Commerce\nClause jurisprudence, reasoned: “In imposing a tax the\nlegislature acts upon its constituents.

Ante, at 13. See also\nante, at 11–15. This Court has not shied away from strik-\ning down or closely scrutinizing state efforts to tax resi-\ndents at a higher rate for out-of-state activities than for in-\nstate activities (or to exempt from taxation only in-state\nactivities). See, e.g., Department of Revenue of Ky. v.\nDavis, 553 U. S. 328, 336 (2008); Camps Newfound/\nOwatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U. S. 564\n——————\n   2 The majority dismisses what we said in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S.\n\n252 (1989), as “dictum” allegedly “repudiated” by the Court in West\nLynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S. 186, 203 (1994). Ante, at 11–\n12. That is doubly wrong. In Goldberg, we distinguished the tax struck\ndown in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266\n(1987) (ATA I), noting, in particular, that the tax in ATA I fell on “out-\nof-state[rs]” whereas the tax in Goldberg fell on “the insider who\npresumably is able to complain about and change the tax through the\nIllinois political process.” 488 U.

Healy, 512 U. S. 186, 200\n(1994). By contrast, the Court has generally upheld “even-\nhanded tax[es] . . . in spite of any adverse effects on\ninterstate commerce, in part because ‘[t]he existence of\nmajor in-state interests adversely affected . . . is a power-\nful safeguard against legislative abuse.’ ” Ibid. (citing,\ninter alia, Goldberg, 488 U. S., at 266). That justification\napplies with full force to the “evenhanded tax” challenged\nhere, which taxes residents’ income at the same rate\nwhether earned in-state or out-of-state.3\n  These rationales for a State taxing its residents’ world-\nwide income are not diminished by another State’s inde-\npendent interest in “requiring contributions from [nonres-\nidents] who realize current pecuniary benefits under the\nprotection of the [State’s] government.” Shaffer v.

Nor would applying the rationale to a\nnet income tax cast “doubt” on the Court’s gross receipts precedents,\nante, at 14–15, given the Court’s longstanding practice of evaluating\nincome and gross receipt taxes differently, see infra, at 12–14.\n6      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nboth States’ governments.\n  States deciding whether to tax residents’ entire world-\nwide income must choose between legitimate but compet-\ning tax policy objectives. A State might prioritize obtain-\ning equal contributions from those who benefit from the\nState’s protection in roughly similar ways. Or a State\nmight prioritize ensuring that its taxpayers are not sub-\nject to double taxation. A State cannot, however, accom-\nplish both objectives at once.\n  To illustrate, consider the Wynnes. Under the tax\nscheme in place in 2006, other Howard County residents\nwho earned their income in-state but who otherwise had\nthe same tax profile as the Wynnes (e.g., $2.67 million in\ntaxable net income) owed the same amount of taxes to\nMaryland as the Wynnes. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A–56.\nThe scheme thus ensured that all residents with similar\naccess to the State’s protection and benefits and similar\nability to pay made equal contributions to the State to\ndefray the costs of those benefits. Maryland could not\nachieve that objective, however, without exposing the\nWynnes to a risk of double taxation. Conversely, the\nCourt prioritizes reducing the risk that the Wynnes’ in-\ncome will be taxed twice by two different States. But that\nchoice comes at a cost: The Wynnes enjoyed equal access\nto the State’s services but will have paid $25,000 less to\ncover the costs of those services than similarly situated\nneighbors who earned their income entirely within the\nState. See Pet. for Cert. 15.\n  States confront the same trade-off when deciding\nwhether to tax nonresidents’ entire in-state income. A\nState can require all residents and nonresidents who work\nwithin the State under its protection to contribute equally\nto the cost of that protection. Or the State can seek to\navoid exposing its workers to any risk of double taxation.\nBut it cannot achieve both objectives.\n  For at least a century, responsibility for striking the\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

See ante, at 17. But since almost the\ndawn of the modern era of state income taxation, other\nStates have taken the same approach as Maryland does\nnow, taxing residents’ entire income, wherever earned,\nwhile at the same time taxing nonresidents’ entire in-state\nincome. And recognizing that “[p]rotection, benefit, and\npower over [a taxpayer’s income] are not confined to ei-\nther” the State of residence or the State in which income is\nearned, this Court has long afforded States that flexibility.\nCurry v. McCanless, 307 U. S. 357, 368 (1939). This history\nof States imposing and this Court upholding income tax\nschemes materially identical to the one the Court con-\nfronts here should be the beginning and end of this case.\n   The modern era of state income taxation dates from a\nWisconsin tax enacted in 1911. See 1911 Wis. Laws ch.\n658; R. Blakey, State Income Taxation 1 (1930). From\nclose to the start of this modern era, States have taxed\nresidents and nonresidents in ways materially indistin-\nguishable from the way Maryland does now. In 1915, for\nexample, Oklahoma began taxing residents’ “entire net\nincome . . . arising or accruing from all sources,” while at\nthe same time taxing nonresidents’ “entire net income\nfrom [sources] in th[e] State.” 1915 Okla. Sess. Laws\nch. 164, §1, pp. 232–233 (emphasis added). Like Maryland\ntoday, Oklahoma provided no credit to either residents or\nnonresidents for taxes paid elsewhere. See id., ch. 164, §1\net seq., at 232–237. In 1917, neighboring Missouri adopted\na similar scheme: Residents owed taxes on their “entire\nnet income . . . from all sources” and nonresidents owed\ntaxes on their “entire net income . . . from all sources\nwithin th[e] state.” 1917 Mo. Laws §1(a), pp. 524–525\n(emphasis added). Missouri too provided neither residents\nnor nonresidents a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdic-\n8         COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ntions. See id., §1 et seq., at 524–538. Thus, much like\nMaryland today, these early income tax adopters simulta-\nneously taxed residents on all income, wherever earned,\nand nonresidents on all income earned within the State.4\n   Almost immediately, this Court began issuing what\nbecame a long series of decisions, repeatedly upholding\nStates’ authority to tax both residents’ worldwide income\nand nonresidents’ in-state income. E.g., Maguire v. Trefry,\n253 U. S. 12, 17 (1920) (resident income tax); Shaffer, 252\nU. S., at 52–53, 57 (nonresident income tax). See also\nState Tax Comm’n of Utah v. Aldrich, 316 U. S. 174, 178\n(1942); Curry, 307 U. S., at 368; Guaranty Trust Co. v.\nVirginia, 305 U. S. 19, 23 (1938); Graves, 300 U. S., at 313;\nLawrence, 286 U. S., at 281. By the end of the 20th cen-\ntury, it was “a well-established principle of interstate and\ninternational taxation” that “sovereigns have authority to\ntax all income of their residents, including income earned\noutside their borders,” Chickasaw Nation, 515 U. S., at\n462, 463, n. 12, and that sovereigns generally may also tax\nnonresidents on “income earned within the [sovereign’s]\njurisdiction,” id., at 463, n. 11.\n   Far from suggesting that States must choose between\ntaxing residents or nonresidents, this Court specifically\naffirmed that the exact same “income may be taxed [si-\nmultaneously] both by the state where it is earned and by\nthe state of the recipient’s domicile.” Curry, 307 U. S., at\n——————\n    4 Unlike Maryland’s county income tax, these early 20th-century\nincome taxes allowed a deduction for taxes paid to other jurisdictions.\nCompare App. 18 with 1917 Mo. Laws §5, pp. 526–527, and 1915 Okla.\nSess. Laws §6, p. 234. The Wynnes have not argued and the majority\ndoes not suggest, however, that Maryland could fully cure the asserted\ndefects in its tax “scheme” simply by providing a deduction, in lieu of a\ntax credit. And I doubt that such a deduction would give the Wynnes\nmuch satisfaction: Deducting taxes paid to other States from the\nWynnes’ $2.67 million taxable net income would reduce their Maryland\ntax burden by a small fraction of the $25,000 tax credit the majority\nawards them.

See also Aldrich, 316 U. S., at 176–\n178, 181 (rejecting “a rule of immunity from taxation by\nmore than one state,” including with respect to income\ntaxation (internal quotation marks omitted)). In Law-\nrence, for example, this Court dealt with a Mississippi tax\n“scheme” with the same structure Maryland has today:\nMississippi taxed residents on all income, wherever\nearned, and nonresidents on income earned within the\nState, without providing either set of taxpayers a credit\nfor taxes paid elsewhere. See 286 U. S., at 278–279; Miss.\nCode Ann. §5033(a), (b)(9) (1930). Lawrence upheld a\nMississippi tax on net income earned by one of its resi-\ndents on the construction of public highways in Tennessee.\nSee 286 U. S., at 279–281. The Court did so fully aware\nthat both Mississippi and Tennessee were effectively\nimposing “an income tax upon the same occupation.”\nReply Brief in Lawrence v. State Tax Comm’n of Miss.,\nO. T. 1931, No. 580, p. 32. See also Curry, 307 U. S., at\n363, n. 1, 368 (discussing Lawrence).\n  Likewise, in Guaranty Trust, both New York and Vir-\nginia had taxed income of a New York trust that had been\ndistributed to a Virginia resident. 305 U. S., at 21–22.\nThe resident sought to block Virginia’s tax in order to\navoid “double taxation” of the “identical income.” Id., at\n22. Rejecting that challenge, the Court once again reiter-\nated that “two States” may simultaneously tax the “same\nincome.” Ibid.\n  The majority deems these cases irrelevant because they\ninvolved challenges brought under the Due Process\nClause, not the Commerce Clause. See ante, at 12–15.\nThese cases are significant, however, not because the\nconstraints imposed by the two Clauses are identical.\nObviously, they are not. See Quill Corp., 504 U. S., at 305.\nWhat the sheer volume and consistency of this precedent\nconfirms, rather, is the degree to which this Court has—\nuntil now—endorsed the “well-established principle of\n10      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ninterstate and international taxation” that a State may\ntax its residents’ worldwide income, without restriction\narising from the source-based taxes imposed by other\nStates and regardless of whether the State also chooses to\nimpose source-based taxes of its own. Chickasaw Nation,\n515 U. S., at 462.5\n   In any event, it is incorrect that support for this princi-\nple is limited to the Court’s Due Process Clause cases. In\nShaffer, for example, this Court rejected both a Due Pro-\ncess Clause challenge and a dormant Commerce Clause\nchallenge to an income tax “scheme” (the Oklahoma stat-\nute described above) with the very features the majority\nlatches onto today: Oklahoma taxed residents on all\nworldwide income and nonresidents on all in-state income,\nwithout providing a credit for taxes paid elsewhere to\neither residents or nonresidents. 252 U. S., at 52–53 (Due\nProcess challenge); id., at 57 (dormant Commerce Clause\nchallenge). See also supra, at 7. The specific tax chal-\nlenged in Shaffer—a tax on a nonresident’s in-state in-\ncome—exposed taxpayers to the same risk of double taxa-\ntion as the Maryland tax challenged in this case. The\nmajority labors mightily to distinguish Shaffer, but it does\nnot dispute the one thing that ought to give it pause:\nToday’s decision overrules Shaffer’s dormant Commerce\nClause holding. See ante, at 15–16. I would not discard\nour precedents so lightly. Just as the tax in Shaffer en-\ncountered no constitutional shoals, so Maryland’s scheme\nshould survive the Court’s inspection.\n——————\n  5 Upholding   Maryland’s facially neutral tax hardly means, as the\nmajority contends, ante, at 12, that the dormant Commerce Clause\nplaces no limits on States’ authority to tax residents’ worldwide income.\nThere are, for example, no well-established principles of interstate and\ninternational taxation permitting the kind of facially discriminatory tax\nthe majority “[i]magine[s]” a State enacting.

S. 307,\n311 (1938)).\n  The long history just recounted counsels in favor of\nrespecting States’ authority to tax without discount its\nresidents’ worldwide income. As Justice Holmes stated\nover a century ago, in regard to a “mode of taxation . . . of\nlong standing, . . . the fact that the system has been in\n12     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nforce for a very long time is of itself a strong reason . . . for\nleaving any improvement that may be desired to the legis-\nlature.” Paddell v. City of New York, 211 U. S. 446, 448\n(1908). Only recently, this Court followed that sound\nadvice in resisting a dormant Commerce Clause challenge\nto a taxing practice with a pedigree as enduring as the\npractice in this case. See Department of Revenue of Ky. v.\nDavis, 553 U. S. 328, 356–357 (2008) (quoting Padell, 211\nU. S., at 448). Surely that advice merits application here,\nwhere the challenged tax draws support from both histori-\ncal practice and numerous decisions of this Court.\n   The majority rejects Justice Holmes’ counsel, observing\nthat most States, over time, have chosen not to exercise\nplenary authority to tax residents’ worldwide income. See\nante, at 17–18. The Court, however, learns the wrong\nlesson from the “independent policy decision[s]” States\nhave made. Chickasaw, 515 U. S., at 463, n. 12 (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted). This history\ndemonstrates not that States “doub[t]” their “constitu-\ntiona[l]” authority to tax residents’ income, wherever\nearned, as the majority speculates, ante, at 18, but that\nthe very political processes the Court disregards as “fanci-\nful,” ante, at 12, have in fact worked to produce policies\nthe Court ranks as responsible—all the more reason to\nresist this Court’s heavy-handed supervision.\n   The Court also attempts to deflect the force of this his-\ntory and precedent by relying on a “trilogy” of decisions it\nfinds “particularly instructive.” Ante, at 6–7 (citing Cen-\ntral Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 334 U. S. 653 (1948);\nGwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 305 U. S. 434\n(1939); J. D. Adams Mfg., 304 U. S. 307). As the majority\nacknowledges, however, those three decisions involved\ngross receipts taxes, not income taxes. Ante, at 7–9. True,\nthis Court has recently pointed to similarities between\nthese two forms of taxation. See ante, at 9. But it is an\nindulgence in wishful thinking to say that this Court has\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\npreviously “rejected the argument that the Commerce\nClause distinguishes between” these taxes. Ante, at 9.\nFor decades—including the years when the majority’s\n“trilogy” was decided—the Court has routinely maintained\nthat “the difference between taxes on net income and taxes\non gross receipts from interstate commerce warrants\ndifferent results” under the Commerce Clause. C. Trost &\nP. Hartman, Federal Limitations on State and Local Taxa-\ntion 2d §10:1 (2003).\n   In Shaffer, for example, the Court rejected the taxpay-\ner’s dormant Commerce Clause challenge because “the tax\n[was] imposed not upon gross receipts . . . but only upon\nthe net proceeds.” 252 U. S., at 57. Just three years\nbefore deciding J. D. Adams, the Court emphasized “mani-\nfest and substantial” differences between the two types of\ntaxes, calling the burden imposed by a gross receipts tax\n“direct and immediate,” in contrast to the “indirect and\nincidental” burden imposed by an income tax. Stewart\nDry Goods Co. v. Lewis, 294 U. S. 550, 558 (1935) (quoting\nUnited States Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, 247 U. S.\n321, 328 (1918)). And the Gwin, White opinion observed\nthat invalidating the gross receipts tax at issue “left to the\nstates wide scope for taxation of those engaged in inter-\nstate commerce, extending to . . . net income derived from\nit.” 305 U. S., at 441 (emphasis added).\n   The majority asserts that this Court “rejected” this\ndistinction in Moorman Mfg. See ante, at 9. That decision\nin fact described gross receipts taxes as “more burden-\nsome” than income taxes—twice. 437 U. S., at 280, 281.\nIn particular, Moorman upheld a state income tax because\nan earlier decision had upheld a similar but “inherently\nmore burdensome” gross receipts tax. Id., at 281. To say\nthat the constitutionality of an income tax follows\na fortiori from the constitutionality of a similar but “more\nburdensome” gross receipts tax is to affirm, not reject, a\ndistinction between the two.\n14     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  The Justices participating in the Court’s “trilogy,” in\nshort, would scarcely expect to see the three decisions\ninvoked to invalidate a tax on net income.\n                              II\n   Abandoning principles and precedent sustaining simul-\ntaneous residence- and source-based income taxation, the\nCourt offers two reasons for striking down Maryland’s\ncounty income tax: (1) the tax creates a risk of double\ntaxation, ante, at 7, 18; and (2) the Court deems Mary-\nland’s income tax “scheme” “inherently discriminatory”—\nby which the Court means, the scheme fails the so-called\n“internal consistency” test, ante, at 21–22. The first objec-\ntion is overwhelmed by the history, recounted above, of\nStates imposing and this Court upholding income taxes\nthat carried a similar risk of double taxation. See supra,\nat 6–12. The Court’s reliance on the internal consistency\ntest is no more compelling.\n   This Court has not rigidly required States to maintain\ninternally consistent tax regimes. Before today, for two\ndecades, the Court has not insisted that a tax under re-\nview pass the internal consistency test, see Oklahoma Tax\nComm’n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 185 (1995),\nand has not struck down a state tax for failing the test in\nnearly 30 years, see American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.\nScheiner, 483 U. S. 266, 284–287 (1987) (ATA I); Tyler\nPipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue,\n483 U. S. 232, 247–248 (1987). Moreover, the Court has\nrejected challenges to taxes that flunk the test. The Okla-\nhoma tax “scheme” upheld under the dormant Commerce\nClause in Shaffer, for example, is materially indistin-\nguishable from—therefore as internally inconsistent as—\nMaryland’s scheme. 252 U. S., at 57. And more recently,\nin American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv.\nComm’n, the Court upheld a “concede[dly]” internally\ninconsistent state tax. 545 U. S. 429, 438 (2005) (ATA II).\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                  15\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nThe Court did so, satisfied that there was a sufficiently\nclose connection between the tax at issue and the local\nconduct that triggered the tax. See ibid.6\n   The logic of ATA II, counsel for the Wynnes appeared to\nrecognize, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 46–47, would permit a State\nto impose a head tax—i.e., a flat charge imposed on every\nresident in the State—even if that tax were part of an\ninternally inconsistent tax scheme. Such a tax would rest\non purely local conduct: the taxpayer’s residence in the\ntaxing State. And the taxes paid would defray costs\nclosely connected to that local conduct—the services used\nby the taxpayer while living in the State.\n   I see no reason why the Constitution requires us to\ndisarm States from using a progressive tax, rather than a\nflat toll, to cover the costs of local services all residents\nenjoy. A head tax and a residence-based income tax differ,\ndo they not, only in that the latter is measured by each\ntaxpayer’s ability to pay. Like the head tax, however, a\nresidence-based income tax is triggered by the purely local\nconduct of residing in the State. And also like the head\ntax, a residence-based income tax covers costs closely\n——————\n  6 The majority reads American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Michigan Pub.\n\nServ. Comm’n, 545 U. S. 429 (2005) (ATA II), in a way so implausible, it\nmust resort to quoting from an amicus brief, rather than from the\nCourt’s opinion. According to the majority, this Court did not think the\nchallenged tax failed the internal consistency test in ATA II, it held\nonly that the challengers had failed to make the necessary “empirical\nshowing.” See ante, at 20–21, n. 7. It is true that the United States\nmade that argument. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nATA II, O. T. 2004, No. 03–1230, p. 26. But one searches the U. S.\nReports in vain for any indication that the Court adopted it. Which is\nhardly surprising, for one would scarcely think that a test turning on\n“hypothetically” assessing a tax’s “structure,” ante, at 19 (emphasis\nadded), would require empirical data. What the Court in fact said in\nATA II, is that the tax’s internal inconsistency would be excused be-\ncause any multiple taxation resulting from every State adopting the\nchallenged tax would be caused by interstate firms’ choosing to “en-\ngag[e] in local business in all those States.” 545 U. S., at 438.\n16      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nconnected to that residence: It finances services used by\nthose living in the State. If a head tax qualifies for ATA\nII’s reprieve from internal consistency, then so too must a\nresidence-based income tax.\n   The majority asserts that because Maryland’s tax\nscheme is internally inconsistent, it “operates as a tariff,”\nmaking it “ ‘patently unconstitutional.’ ” Ante, at 22. This\nis a curious claim. The defining characteristic of a tariff is\nthat it taxes interstate activity at a higher rate than it\ntaxes the same activity conducted within the State. See\nWest Lynn Creamery, 512 U. S., at 193. Maryland’s resi-\ndent income tax does the exact opposite: It taxes the in-\ncome of its residents at precisely the same rate, whether\nthe income is earned in-state or out-of-state.7\n   There is, moreover, a deep flaw in the Court’s chosen\ntest. The Court characterizes internal consistency as a\n“cure,” ante, at 18, 25–26, but the test is scarcely that, at\nleast for the double taxation the Court believes to justify\nits intervention. According to the Court, Maryland’s tax\n“scheme” is internally inconsistent because Maryland\nsimultaneously imposes two taxes: the county income tax\nand the special nonresident tax. See ante, at 7, 21–22, and\nn. 8. But only one of these taxes—the county income tax—\nactually falls on the Wynnes. Because it is the interaction\nbetween these two taxes that renders Maryland’s tax\nscheme internally inconsistent, Maryland could eliminate\nthe inconsistency by terminating the special nonresident\ntax—a measure that would not help the Wynnes at all.8\nMaryland could, in other words, bring itself into compli-\nance with the test at the heart of the Court’s analysis\nwithout removing the double tax burden the test is pur-\n——————\n  7 The majority faults the dissents for not “disput[ing]” its “economic\n\nanalysis,” but beyond citation to a pair of amicus briefs, its opinion\noffers no analysis to dispute.

Ante, at\n21–22, 25. Both States fail the internal consistency test\nbecause they impose (1) a 1.25% tax on income that resi-\ndents earn in-state, (2) a 1.25% tax on income that resi-\ndents earn in other jurisdictions, and (3) a 1.25% tax on\nincome that nonresidents earn in-state. According to the\nCourt, these tax schemes are troubling because “Bob will\npay more income tax than April solely because he earns\nincome interstate.” Ante, at 22.\n  Each State, however, need not pursue the same ap-\nproach to make their tax schemes internally consistent.9\nSee ante, at 25–26. State A might choose to tax residents’\nworldwide income only, which it could do by eliminating\ntax #3 (on nonresidents’ in-state income). State B might\ninstead choose exclusively to tax income earned within the\nState by deleting tax #2 (on residents’ out-of-state income).\nEach State’s tax scheme would then be internally con-\nsistent. But the tax burden on April and Bob would re-\nmain unchanged: Just as under the original schemes,\nApril would have to pay a 1.25% tax only once, to State A,\nand Bob would have to pay a 1.25% tax twice: once to\nState A, where he resides, and once to State B, where he\nearns the income. The Court’s “cure,” in other words, is no\nmatch for the perceived disease.10\n——————\n  9 I do not “clai[m]” as the Court groundlessly suggests, that the\n\nCourt’s analysis “establish[es] . . . [a] rule of priority” between resi-\ndence- and source-based taxation. Ante, at 25–26. My objection,\nrather, is that the Court treats source-based authority as “box[ing] in” a\nState’s discrete authority to tax on the basis of residence. Supra, at 1.\nThere is no “inconsisten[cy]” in my analysis, and the majority plainly\nerrs in insisting that there is. Ante, at 25.\n  10 Attempting to preserve the test’s qualification as a “cure,” the\n\nCourt redefines the illness as not just double taxation but double\ntaxation caused by an “inherently discriminat[ory]” tax “scheme.” Ante,\n18      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court asserts that this flaw is just a “truism” of\nevery discrimination case, whether brought under the\ndormant Commerce Clause or the Equal Protection\nClause. Ante, at 26. That is simply incorrect. As the\nCourt acknowledges, a government that impermissibly\n“treats like cases differently” (i.e., discriminates) can\nordinarily cure the violation either by “leveling up” or\n“leveling down.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nConsider another April and Bob example. If Bob must pay\na 10% tax and April must pay a 5% tax, that discrimina-\ntion can be eliminated either by requiring both to pay the\n10% tax (“leveling up”) or by requiring both to pay the 5%\ntax (“leveling down”). True, “leveling up” leaves Bob’s tax\nbill unchanged. “Leveling up” nonetheless benefits Bob\nbecause it eliminates the unfairness of being treated\ndifferently. And if, as is often true in dormant Commerce\nClause cases, April and Bob compete in the same market,\nthen “leveling up” provides the concrete benefit of placing\na new burden on Bob’s competitors.\n   The majority’s rule does not work this way. As just\nexplained, Maryland can “cure” what the majority deems\ndiscrimination without lowering the Wynnes’ taxes or\nincreasing the tax burden on any of the Wynnes’ neigh-\nbors—by terminating the special nonresident tax. See\nsupra, at 16–17. The State can, in other words, satisfy the\nmajority not by lowering Bob’s taxes or by raising April’s\ntaxes, but by eliminating the taxes imposed on yet a third\n\n——————\nat 19–20. Relying on such a distinction to justify the test is entirely\ncircular, however, as the Court defines “inherent discrimination” in this\ncase as internal inconsistency. In any event, given the concern that\npurportedly drives the Court’s analysis, it is mystifying why the Court\nsees “virtue” in striking down only one of the two schemes under which\nBob is taxed twice. Ante, at 19. Whatever disincentive the original\nscheme creates for Bob (or the Wynnes) to work in interstate commerce\nis created just as much by the revised scheme that the Court finds\nsatisfactory.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

The Court’s internal consis-\ntency test thus scarcely resembles “ordinary” anti-\ndiscrimination law. Whatever virtue the internal con-\nsistency test has in other contexts, this shortcoming\nmakes it a poor excuse for jettisoning taxation principles\nas entrenched as those here.\n                        *    *     *\n   This case is, at bottom, about policy choices: Should\nStates prioritize ensuring that all who live or work within\nthe State shoulder their fair share of the costs of govern-\nment? Or must States prioritize avoidance of double\ntaxation? As I have demonstrated, supra, at 16–19,\nachieving even the latter goal is beyond this Court’s com-\npetence.

For a century, we have recog-\nnized that state legislatures and the Congress are consti-\ntutionally assigned and institutionally better equipped to\nbalance such issues.

Argued November 12, 2014—Decided May 18, 2015\nMaryland’s personal income tax on state residents consists of a “state”\n income tax, Md. Tax-Gen. Code Ann. §10–105(a), and a “county” in-\n come tax, §§10–103, 10–106. Residents who pay income tax to anoth-\n er jurisdiction for income earned in that other jurisdiction are al-\n lowed a credit against the “state” tax but not the “county” tax. §10–\n 703. Nonresidents who earn income from sources within Maryland\n must pay the “state” income tax, §§10–105(d), 10–210, and nonresi-\n dents not subject to the county tax must pay a “special nonresident\n tax” in lieu of the “county” tax, §10–106.1.\n   Respondents, Maryland residents, earned pass-through income\n from a Subchapter S corporation that earned income in several\n States. Respondents claimed an income tax credit on their 2006\n Maryland income tax return for taxes paid to other States. The Mary-\n land State Comptroller of the Treasury, petitioner here, allowed re-\n spondents a credit against their “state” income tax but not against\n their “county” income tax and assessed a tax deficiency. That deci-\n sion was affirmed by the Hearings and Appeals Section of the Comp-\n troller’s Office and by the Maryland Tax Court, but the Circuit Court\n for Howard County reversed on the ground that Maryland’s tax sys-\n tem violated the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. The\n Court of Appeals of Maryland affirmed and held that the tax uncon-\n stitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce.\nHeld: Maryland’s personal income tax scheme violates the dormant\n Commerce Clause.

This Court’s decisions have\n    previously rejected the formal distinction between gross receipts and\n    net income taxes. And there is no reason the dormant Commerce\n    Clause should treat individuals less favorably than corporations; in\n    addition, the taxes invalidated in J. D. Adams and Gwin, White ap-\n    plied to the income of both individuals and corporations. Nor does\n    the right of the individual to vote in political elections justify dispar-\n    ate treatment of corporate and personal income. Thus the Court has\n    previously entertained and even sustained dormant Commerce\n    Clause challenges by individual residents of the State that imposed\n    the alleged burden on interstate commerce.

Like\nmany other States, Maryland taxes the income its resi­\ndents earn both within and outside the State, as well as\nthe income that nonresidents earn from sources within\nMaryland. But unlike most other States, Maryland does\nnot offer its residents a full credit against the income\ntaxes that they pay to other States. The effect of this\nscheme is that some of the income earned by Maryland\nresidents outside the State is taxed twice. Maryland’s\nscheme creates an incentive for taxpayers to opt for intra­\nstate rather than interstate economic activity.\n   We have long held that States cannot subject corporate\nincome to tax schemes similar to Maryland’s, and we see\nno reason why income earned by individuals should be\ntreated less favorably. Maryland admits that its law has\nthe same economic effect as a state tariff, the quintessen­\ntial evil targeted by the dormant Commerce Clause. We\ntherefore affirm the decision of Maryland’s highest court\nand hold that this feature of the State’s tax scheme vio­\n2      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlates the Federal Constitution.\n                              I\n   Maryland, like most States, raises revenue in part by\nlevying a personal income tax. The income tax that Mary­\nland imposes upon its own residents has two parts: a\n“state” income tax, which is set at a graduated rate, Md.\nTax-Gen. Code Ann. §10–105(a) (Supp. 2014), and a so-\ncalled “county” income tax, which is set at a rate that\nvaries by county but is capped at 3.2%, §§10–103, 10–106\n(2010). Despite the names that Maryland has assigned to\nthese taxes, both are State taxes, and both are collected by\nthe State’s Comptroller of the Treasury. Frey v. Comptrol-\nler of Treasury, 422 Md. 111, 125, 141–142, 29 A. 3d 475,\n483, 492 (2011). Of course, some Maryland residents earn\nincome in other States, and some of those States also tax\nthis income. If Maryland residents pay income tax to\nanother jurisdiction for income earned there, Maryland\nallows them a credit against the “state” tax but not the\n“county” tax. §10–703; 431 Md. 147, 156–157, 64 A. 3d\n453, 458 (2013) (case below). As a result, part of the in­\ncome that a Maryland resident earns outside the State\nmay be taxed twice.\n   Maryland also taxes the income of nonresidents. This\ntax has two parts. First, nonresidents must pay the\n“state” income tax on all the income that they earn from\nsources within Maryland. §§10–105(d) (Supp. 2014), 10–\n210 (2010). Second, nonresidents not subject to the county\ntax must pay a “special nonresident tax” in lieu of the\n“county” tax. §10–106.1; Frey, supra, at 125–126, 29 A.\n3d, at 483. The “special nonresident tax” is levied on\nincome earned from sources within Maryland, and its rate\nis “equal to the lowest county income tax rate set by any\nMaryland county.” §10–106.1. Maryland does not tax the\nincome that nonresidents earn from sources outside Mary­\nland. See §10–210.\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

In 2006, the relevant tax year, Brian Wynne\nowned stock in Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc., a Sub-\nchapter S corporation.1 That year, Maxim earned income\nin States other than Maryland, and it filed state income\ntax returns in 39 States. The Wynnes earned income\npassed through to them from Maxim. On their 2006 Mary­\nland tax return, the Wynnes claimed an income tax credit\nfor income taxes paid to other States.\n   Petitioner, the Maryland State Comptroller of the\nTreasury, denied this claim and assessed a tax deficiency.\nIn accordance with Maryland law, the Comptroller allowed\nthe Wynnes a credit against their Maryland “state” income\ntax but not against their “county” income tax. The Hear­\nings and Appeals Section of the Comptroller’s Office\nslightly modified the assessment but otherwise affirmed.\nThe Maryland Tax Court also affirmed, but the Circuit\nCourt for Howard County reversed on the ground that\nMaryland’s tax system violated the Commerce Clause.\n   The Court of Appeals of Maryland affirmed. 431 Md.\n147, 64 A. 3d 453. That court evaluated the tax under the\nfour-part test of Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430\n\n——————\n  1 Under   federal law, S corporations permit shareholders “to elect a\n‘pass-through’ taxation system under which income is subjected to only\none level of taxation.

S. 206, 209\n(2001) (citation omitted). Maryland affords similar pass-through\ntreatment to the income of an S corporation. 431 Md. 147, 158, 64 A. 3d\n453, 459 (2013). By contrast, C corporations—organized under Sub-\nchapter C rather than S of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code—\nmust pay their own taxes because they are considered to be separate\ntax entities from their shareholders. 14A W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of\nthe Law of Corporations §§6971, 6973 (rev. ed. 2008 and Cum. Supp.\n2014–2015).

S. 274 (1977), which asks whether a “tax is applied to\nan activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State,\nis fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against inter­\nstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services pro­\nvided by the State.” Id., at 279. The Court of Appeals\nheld that the tax failed both the fair apportionment and\nnondiscrimination parts of the Complete Auto test. With\nrespect to fair apportionment, the court first held that the\ntax failed the “internal consistency” test because if every\nState adopted Maryland’s tax scheme, interstate com­\nmerce would be taxed at a higher rate than intrastate\ncommerce. It then held that the tax failed the “external\nconsistency” test because it created a risk of multiple\ntaxation. With respect to nondiscrimination, the court\nheld that the tax discriminated against interstate com­\nmerce because it denied residents a credit on income taxes\npaid to other States and so taxed income earned interstate\nat a rate higher than income earned intrastate. The court\nthus concluded that Maryland’s tax scheme was unconsti­\ntutional insofar as it denied the Wynnes a credit against\nthe “county” tax for income taxes they paid to other States.\nTwo judges dissented and argued that the tax did not\nviolate the Commerce Clause. The Court of Appeals later\nissued a brief clarification that “[a] state may avoid dis­\ncrimination against interstate commerce by providing a\ntax credit, or some other method of apportionment, to\navoid discriminating against interstate commerce in viola­\ntion of the dormant Commerce Clause.” 431 Md., at 189,\n64 A. 3d at 478.\n   We granted certiorari. 572 U.

Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325, 330–331 (1996);\nHughes, supra, at 325; Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275,\n280 (1876); see also The Federalist Nos. 7, 11 (A. Hamil­\nton), and 42 (J. Madison).\n   Under our precedents, the dormant Commerce Clause\n6      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprecludes States from “discriminat[ing] between transac­\ntions on the basis of some interstate element.” Boston\nStock Exchange v. State Tax Comm’n, 429 U. S. 318, 332,\nn. 12 (1977). This means, among other things, that a\nState “may not tax a transaction or incident more heavily\nwhen it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirely\nwithin the State.” Armco Inc. v. Hardesty, 467 U. S. 638,\n642 (1984). “Nor may a State impose a tax which discrim­\ninates against interstate commerce either by providing a\ndirect commercial advantage to local business, or by sub­\njecting interstate commerce to the burden of ‘multiple\ntaxation.’ ” Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v.\nMinnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 458 (1959) (citations omitted).\n                              B\n   Our existing dormant Commerce Clause cases all but\ndictate the result reached in this case by Maryland’s high­\nest court. Three cases involving the taxation of the income\nof domestic corporations are particularly instructive.\n   In J. D. Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, 304 U. S. 307 (1938),\nIndiana taxed the income of every Indiana resident (in­\ncluding individuals) and the income that every nonresi­\ndent derived from sources within Indiana. Id., at 308.\nThe State levied the tax on income earned by the plaintiff\nIndiana corporation on sales made out of the State. Id., at\n309. Holding that this scheme violated the dormant\nCommerce Clause, we explained that the “vice of the\nstatute” was that it taxed, “without apportionment, re­\nceipts derived from activities in interstate commerce.” Id.,\nat 311. If these receipts were also taxed by the States in\nwhich the sales occurred, we warned, interstate commerce\nwould be subjected “to the risk of a double tax burden to\nwhich intrastate commerce is not exposed, and which the\ncommerce clause forbids.” Ibid.\n   The next year, in Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v.\nHenneford, 305 U. S. 434 (1939), we reached a similar\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresult. In that case, the State of Washington taxed all the\nincome of persons doing business in the State. Id., at 435.\nWashington levied that tax on income that the plaintiff\nWashington corporation earned in shipping fruit from\nWashington to other States and foreign countries. Id., at\n436–437. This tax, we wrote, “discriminates against inter­\nstate commerce, since it imposes upon it, merely because\ninterstate commerce is being done, the risk of a multiple\nburden to which local commerce is not exposed.” Id., at\n439.\n   In the third of these cases involving the taxation of a\ndomestic corporation, Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v.\nMealey, 334 U. S. 653 (1948), New York sought to tax the\nportion of a domiciliary bus company’s gross receipts that\nwere derived from services provided in neighboring States.\nId., at 660; see also id., at 665 (Murphy, J., dissenting)\n(stating that the plaintiff was a New York corporation).\nNoting that these other States might also attempt to tax\nthis portion of the company’s gross receipts, the Court held\nthat the New York scheme violated the dormant Com­\nmerce Clause because it imposed an “unfair burden” on\ninterstate commerce. Id., at 662 (majority opinion).\n   In all three of these cases, the Court struck down a state\ntax scheme that might have resulted in the double taxa­\ntion of income earned out of the State and that discrimi­\nnated in favor of intrastate over interstate economic activ­\nity. As we will explain, see Part II–F, infra, Maryland’s\ntax scheme is unconstitutional for similar reasons.\n                            C\n  The principal dissent distinguishes these cases on the\nsole ground that they involved a tax on gross receipts\nrather than net income. We see no reason why the dis­\ntinction between gross receipts and net income should\nmatter, particularly in light of the admonition that we\nmust consider “not the formal language of the tax statute\n8      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut rather its practical effect.” Complete Auto, 430 U. S.,\nat 279. The principal dissent claims, post, at 13 (opinion\nof GINSBURG, J.), that “[t]he Court, historically, has taken\nthe position that the difference between taxes on net\nincome and taxes on gross receipts from interstate com­\nmerce warrants different results.” 2 C. Trost & P. Hart­\nman, Federal Limitations on State and Local Taxation 2d\n§10:1, p. 251 (2003) (emphasis added) (hereinafter Trost).\nBut this historical point is irrelevant. As the principal\ndissent seems to acknowledge, our cases rejected this\nformal distinction some time ago. And the distinction\nbetween gross receipts and net income taxes was not the\nbasis for our decisions in J. D. Adams, Gwin, White, and\nCentral Greyhound, which turned instead on the threat of\nmultiple taxation.\n   The discarded distinction between taxes on gross re­\nceipts and net income was based on the notion, endorsed\nin some early cases, that a tax on gross receipts is an\nimpermissible “direct and immediate burden” on inter­\nstate commerce, whereas a tax on net income is merely an\n“indirect and incidental” burden. United States Glue Co.\nv. Town of Oak Creek, 247 U. S. 321, 328–329 (1918); see\nalso Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U. S. 37, 57 (1920). This arid\ndistinction between direct and indirect burdens allowed\n“very little coherent, trustworthy guidance as to tax valid­\nity.” 2 Trost §9:1, at 212. And so, beginning with Justice\nStone’s seminal opinion in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of\nRevenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938), and continuing through\ncases like J. D. Adams and Gwin, White, the direct-\nindirect burdens test was replaced with a more practical\napproach that looked to the economic impact of the tax.\nThese cases worked “a substantial judicial reinterpreta­\ntion of the power of the States to levy taxes on gross in­\ncome from interstate commerce.” 1 Trost §2:20, at 175.\n   After a temporary reversion to our earlier formalism,\nsee Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O’Connor, 340 U. S. 602\n                    Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(1951), “the gross receipts judicial pendulum has swung in\na wide arc, recently reaching the place where taxation of\ngross receipts from interstate commerce is placed on an\nequal footing with receipts from local business, in Com-\nplete Auto Transit Inc. v. Brady,” 2 Trost §9:1, at 212. And\nwe have now squarely rejected the argument that the\nCommerce Clause distinguishes between taxes on net and\ngross income. See Jefferson Lines, 514 U. S., at 190 (ex­\nplaining that the Court in Central Greyhound “understood\nthe gross receipts tax to be simply a variety of tax on\nincome”); Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 280\n(1978) (rejecting a suggestion that the Commerce Clause\ndistinguishes between gross receipts taxes and net income\ntaxes); id., at 281 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (“I agree with\nthe Court that, for purposes of constitutional review, there\nis no distinction between a corporate income tax and a\ngross-receipts tax”); Complete Auto, supra, at 280 (uphold­\ning a gross receipts tax and rejecting the notion that the\nCommerce Clause places “a blanket prohibition against\nany state taxation imposed directly on an interstate\ntransaction”).2\n  For its part, petitioner distinguishes J. D. Adams, Gwin,\nWhite, and Central Greyhound on the ground that they\nconcerned the taxation of corporations, not individuals.\nBut it is hard to see why the dormant Commerce Clause\nshould treat individuals less favorably than corporations.\n——————\n  2 The principal dissent mischaracterizes the import of the Court’s\nstatement in Moorman that a gross receipts tax is “ ‘more burdensome’ ”\nthan a net income tax. Post, at 13. This was a statement about the\nrelative economic impact of the taxes (a gross receipts tax applies\nregardless of whether the corporation makes a profit). It was not, as\nJustice Brennan confirmed in dissent, a suggestion that net income\ntaxes are subject to lesser constitutional scrutiny than gross receipts\ntaxes. Indeed, we noted in Moorman that “the actual burden on inter­\nstate commerce would have been the same had Iowa imposed a plainly\nvalid gross-receipts tax instead of the challenged [net] income tax.”\nMoorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 280–281 (1978).\n10     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Camps Newfound, 520 U. S., at 574 (“A tax on real\nestate, like any other tax, may impermissibly burden\ninterstate commerce” (emphasis added)). In addition, the\ndistinction between individuals and corporations cannot\nstand because the taxes invalidated in J. D. Adams and\nGwin, White applied to the income of both individuals and\ncorporations. See Ind. Stat. Ann., ch. 26, §64–2602 (Burns\n1933) (tax in J. D. Adams); 1935 Wash. Sess. Laws ch.\n180, Tit. II, §4(e), pp. 710–711 (tax in Gwin, White).\n   Attempting to explain why the dormant Commerce\nClause should provide less protection for natural persons\nthan for corporations, petitioner and the Solicitor General\nargue that States should have a free hand to tax their\nresidents’ out-of-state income because States provide their\nresidents with many services. As the Solicitor General\nputs it, individuals “reap the benefits of local roads, local\npolice and fire protection, local public schools, [and] local\nhealth and welfare benefits.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 30.\n   This argument fails because corporations also benefit\nheavily from state and local services. Trucks hauling a\ncorporation’s supplies and goods, and vehicles transport­\ning its employees, use local roads. Corporations call upon\nlocal police and fire departments to protect their facilities.\nCorporations rely on local schools to educate prospective\nemployees, and the availability of good schools and other\ngovernment services are features that may aid a corpora­\ntion in attracting and retaining employees. Thus, dispar­\nate treatment of corporate and personal income cannot be\njustified based on the state services enjoyed by these two\ngroups of taxpayers.\n   The sole remaining attribute that, in the view of peti­\ntioner, distinguishes a corporation from an individual for\npresent purposes is the right of the individual to vote. The\nprincipal dissent also emphasizes that residents can vote\nto change Maryland’s discriminatory tax law. Post, at 3–4.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nThe argument is that this Court need not be concerned\nabout state laws that burden the interstate activities of\nindividuals because those individuals can lobby and vote\nagainst legislators who support such measures. But if a\nState’s tax unconstitutionally discriminates against inter­\nstate commerce, it is invalid regardless of whether the\nplaintiff is a resident voter or nonresident of the State.\nThis Court has thus entertained and even sustained\ndormant Commerce Clause challenges by individual resi­\ndents of the State that imposed the alleged burden on\ninterstate commerce, Department of Revenue of Ky. v.\nDavis, 553 U. S. 328, 336 (2008); Granholm v. Heald, 544\nU. S. 460, 469 (2005), and we have also sustained such a\nchallenge to a tax whose burden was borne by in-state\nconsumers, Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263,\n272 (1984).3\n  The principal dissent and JUSTICE SCALIA respond to\nthese holdings by relying on dictum in Goldberg v. Sweet,\n488 U. S. 252, 266 (1989), that it is not the purpose of the\ndormant Commerce Clause “ ‘to protect state residents\nfrom their own state taxes.’ ” Post, at 3 (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting); post, at 5 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But we\nrepudiated that dictum in West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v.\nHealy, 512 U. S. 186 (1994), where we stated that “[s]tate\ntaxes are ordinarily paid by in-state businesses and con­\nsumers, yet if they discriminate against out-of-state prod­\nucts, they are unconstitutional.” Id., at 203. And, of\ncourse, the dictum must bow to the holdings of our many\ncases entertaining Commerce Clause challenges brought\n——————\n  3 Similarly, we have sustained dormant Commerce Clause challenges\n\nby corporate residents of the State that imposed the burden on inter­\nstate commerce. See, e.g., Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of\nHarrison, 520 U. S. 564, 567 (1997); Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S.\n325, 328 (1996); Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 334 U. S. 653,\n654 (1948); Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 305 U. S. 434, 435\n(1939); J. D. Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, 304 U. S. 307, 308 (1938).\n12     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nby residents. We find the dissents’ reliance on Goldberg’s\ndictum particularly inappropriate since they do not find\nthemselves similarly bound by the rule of that case, which\napplied the internal consistency test to determine whether\nthe tax at issue violated the dormant Commerce Clause.\n488 U. S., at 261.\n   In addition, the notion that the victims of such discrimi­\nnation have a complete remedy at the polls is fanciful. It\nis likely that only a distinct minority of a State’s residents\nearns income out of State. Schemes that discriminate\nagainst income earned in other States may be attractive\nto legislators and a majority of their constituents for pre­\ncisely this reason. It is even more farfetched to suggest that\nnatural persons with out-of-state income are better able to\ninfluence state lawmakers than large corporations head­\nquartered in the State. In short, petitioner’s argument\nwould leave no security where the majority of voters prefer\nprotectionism at the expense of the few who earn income\ninterstate.\n   It would be particularly incongruous in the present case\nto disregard our prior decisions regarding the taxation of\ncorporate income because the income at issue here is a\ntype of corporate income, namely, the income of a Sub-\nchapter S corporation. Only small businesses may incor­\nporate under Subchapter S, and thus acceptance of peti­\ntioner’s submission would provide greater protection for\nincome earned by large Subchapter C corporations than\nsmall businesses incorporated under Subchapter S.\n                             D\n   In attempting to justify Maryland’s unusual tax scheme,\nthe principal dissent argues that the Commerce Clause\nimposes no limit on Maryland’s ability to tax the income of\nits residents, no matter where that income is earned. It\nargues that Maryland has the sovereign power to tax all of\nthe income of its residents, wherever earned, and it there­\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfore reasons that the dormant Commerce Clause cannot\nconstrain Maryland’s ability to expose its residents (and\nnonresidents) to the threat of double taxation.\n  This argument confuses what a State may do without\nviolating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment with what it may do without violating the\nCommerce Clause. The Due Process Clause allows a State\nto tax “all the income of its residents, even income earned\noutside the taxing jurisdiction.” Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v.\nChickasaw Nation, 515 U. S. 450, 462–463 (1995). But\n“while a State may, consistent with the Due Process\nClause, have the authority to tax a particular taxpayer,\nimposition of the tax may nonetheless violate the Com­\nmerce Clause.” Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U. S.\n298, 305 (1992) (rejecting a due process challenge to a tax\nbefore sustaining a Commerce Clause challenge to that\ntax).\n  Our decision in Camps Newfound illustrates the point.\nThere, we held that the Commerce Clause prohibited\nMaine from granting more favorable tax treatment to\ncharities that operated principally for the benefit of Maine\nresidents. 520 U. S., at 580–583. Because the plaintiff\ncharity in that case was a Maine nonprofit corporation,\nthere is no question that Maine had the raw jurisdictional\npower to tax the charity. See Chickasaw Nation, supra, at\n462–463. Nonetheless, the tax failed scrutiny under the\nCommerce Clause. Camps Newfound, supra, at 580–581.\nSimilarly, Maryland’s raw power to tax its residents’ out­\nof-state income does not insulate its tax scheme from\nscrutiny under the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  Although the principal dissent claims the mantle of\nprecedent, it is unable to identify a single case that en­\ndorses its essential premise, namely, that the Commerce\nClause places no constraint on a State’s power to tax the\nincome of its residents wherever earned. This is unsur­\nprising. As cases like Quill Corp. and Camps Newfound\n14     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrecognize, the fact that a State has the jurisdictional\npower to impose a tax says nothing about whether that tax\nviolates the Commerce Clause. See also, e.g., Barclays\nBank PLC v. Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal., 512 U. S. 298\n(1994) (separately addressing due process and Commerce\nClause challenges to a tax); Moorman, 437 U. S. 267\n(same); Standard Pressed Steel Co. v. Department of Reve-\nnue of Wash., 419 U. S. 560 (1975) (same); Lawrence v.\nState Tax Comm’n of Miss., 286 U. S. 276 (1932) (separately\naddressing due process and equal protection challenges\nto a tax); Travis v. Yale & Towne Mfg. Co., 252 U. S. 60\n(1920) (separately addressing due process and privileges­\nand-immunities challenges to a tax).\n   One good reason why we have never accepted the prin­\ncipal dissent’s logic is that it would lead to plainly untena­\nble results. Imagine that Maryland taxed the income that\nits residents earned in other States but exempted income\nearned out of State from any business that primarily\nserved Maryland residents. Such a tax would violate the\ndormant Commerce Clause, see Camps Newfound, supra,\nand it cannot be saved by the principal dissent’s admoni­\ntion that Maryland has the power to tax all the income of\nits residents. There is no principled difference between\nthat hypothetical Commerce Clause challenge and this\none.\n   The principal dissent, if accepted, would work a sea\nchange in our Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Legion\nare the cases in which we have considered and even up­\nheld dormant Commerce Clause challenges brought by\nresidents to taxes that the State had the jurisdictional\npower to impose. See, e.g., Davis, 553 U. S. 328; Camps\nNewfound, 520 U. S. 564; Fulton Corp., 516 U. S. 325;\nBacchus Imports, 468 U. S. 263; Central Greyhound, 334\nU. S. 653; Gwin, White, 305 U. S. 434; J. D. Adams, 304\nU. S. 307. If the principal dissent were to prevail, all of\nthese cases would be thrown into doubt. After all, in those\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncases, as here, the State’s decision to tax in a way that\nallegedly discriminates against interstate commerce could\nbe justified by the argument that a State may tax its\nresidents without any Commerce Clause constraints.\n                               E\n   While the principal dissent claims that we are departing\nfrom principles that have been accepted for “a century”\nand have been “repeatedly acknowledged by this Court,”\nsee post, at 1, 2, 19, when it comes to providing supporting\nauthority for this assertion, it cites exactly two Commerce\nClause decisions that are supposedly inconsistent with our\ndecision today. One is a summary affirmance, West Pub-\nlishing Co. v. McColgan, 328 U. S. 823 (1946), and neither\nactually supports the principal dissent’s argument.\n   In the first of these cases, Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U. S.\n37, a resident of Illinois who earned income from oil in\nOklahoma unsuccessfully argued that his Oklahoma\nincome tax assessment violated several provisions of the\nFederal Constitution. His main argument was based on\ndue process, but he also raised a dormant Commerce\nClause challenge. Although the principal dissent relies on\nShaffer for the proposition that a State may tax the in­\ncome of its residents wherever earned, Shaffer did not\nreject the Commerce Clause challenge on that basis.\n   The dormant Commerce Clause challenge in Shaffer\nwas nothing like the Wynnes’ challenge here. The tax-\npayer in Shaffer argued that “[i]f the tax is considered an\nexcise tax on business, rather than an income tax proper,”\nit unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce. Brief\nfor Appellant, O. T. 1919, No. 531, p. 166. The taxpayer\ndid not argue that this burden occurred because he was\nsubject to double taxation; instead, he argued that the tax\nwas an impermissible direct “tax on interstate business.”\nIbid. That argument was based on the notion that States\nmay not impose a tax “directly” on interstate commerce.\n16     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee supra, at 8–9. After assuming that the taxpayer’s\nbusiness was engaged in interstate commerce, we held\nthat “it is sufficient to say that the tax is imposed not upon\nthe gross receipts, but only upon the net proceeds, and is\nplainly sustainable, even if it includes net gains from\ninterstate commerce. [United States Glue Co. v. Town of\nOak Creek], 247 U. S. 321.” Shaffer, supra, at 57 (citation\nomitted).\n  Shaffer thus did not adjudicate anything like the double\ntaxation argument that was accepted in later cases and is\nbefore us today. And the principal dissent’s suggestion\nthat Shaffer allows States to levy discriminatory net\nincome taxes is refuted by a case decided that same day.\nIn Travis, a Connecticut corporation challenged New\nYork’s net income tax, which allowed residents, but not\nnonresidents, certain tax exemptions. The Court first\nrejected the taxpayer’s due process argument as “settled\nby our decision in Shaffer.” 252 U. S., at 75. But that due\nprocess inquiry was not the end of the matter: the Court\nthen separately considered—and sustained—the argu­\nment that the net income tax’s disparate treatment of\nresidents and nonresidents violated the Privileges and\nImmunities Clause. Id., at 79–80.\n  The second case on which the principal dissent relies,\nWest Publishing, is a summary affirmance and thus has\n“considerably less precedential value than an opinion on\nthe merits.” Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers\nParty, 440 U. S. 173, 180–181 (1979). A summary affir­\nmance “ ‘is not to be read as a renunciation by this Court of\ndoctrines previously announced in our opinions after full\nargument.’ ” Mandel v. Bradley, 432 U. S. 173, 176 (1977)\n(per curiam) (quoting Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U. S. 379,\n392 (1975) (Burger, C. J., concurring)). The principal\ndissent’s reliance on the state-court decision below in that\ncase is particularly inappropriate because “a summary\naffirmance is an affirmance of the judgment only,” and\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“the rationale of the affirmance may not be gleaned solely\nfrom the opinion below.” 432 U. S., at 176.\n   Moreover, we do not disagree with the result of West\nPublishing. The tax in that case was levied only on “ ‘the\nnet income of every corporation derived from sources\nwithin this State,’ ” and thus was an internally consistent\nand nondiscriminatory tax scheme. See West Publishing\nCo. v. McColgan, 27 Cal. 2d 705, 707, n., 166 P. 2d 861,\n862, n. (1946) (emphasis added). Moreover, even if we did\ndisagree with the result, the citation in our summary\naffirmance to United States Glue Co. suggests that our\ndecision was based on the since-discarded distinction\nbetween net income and gross receipts taxes. West Pub-\nlishing did not—indeed, it could not—repudiate the double\ntaxation cases upon which we rely.\n   The principal dissent also finds it significant that, when\nStates first enacted modern income taxes in the early\n1900’s, some States had tax schemes similar to Mary­\nland’s. This practice, however, was by no means univer­\nsal. A great many States—such as Alabama, Colorado,\nGeorgia, Kentucky, and Maryland—had early income tax\nschemes that allowed their residents a credit against taxes\npaid to other States. See Ala. Code, Tit. 51, ch. 17, §390\n(1940); Colo. Stat. Ann., ch. 84A, §38 (Cum. Supp. 1951);\nGa. Code Ann. §92–3111 (1974); Carroll’s Ky. Stat. Ann.,\nch. 108, Art. XX, §4281b–15 (Baldwin rev. 1936); Md. Ann.\nCode, Art. 81, ch. 277, §231 (1939). Other States also\nadopted internally consistent tax schemes. For example,\nMassachusetts and Utah taxed only the income of resi­\ndents, not nonresidents. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 62\n(1932); Utah Rev. Stat. §80–14–1 et seq. (1933).\n   In any event, it is hardly surprising that these early\nstate ventures into the taxation of income included some\nprotectionist regimes that favored the local economy over\ninterstate commerce. What is much more significant is\nthat over the next century, as our Commerce Clause juris­\n18       COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprudence developed, the States have almost entirely\nabandoned that approach, perhaps in recognition of their\ndoubtful constitutionality. Today, the near-universal state\npractice is to provide credits against personal income taxes\nfor such taxes paid to other States. See 2 J. Hellerstein &\nW. Hellerstein, State Taxation, ¶20.10, pp. 20–163 to 20–\n164 (3d ed. 2003).4\n                             F\n                             1\n  As previously noted, the tax schemes held to be uncon­\nstitutional in J. D. Adams, Gwin, White, and Central\nGreyhound, had the potential to result in the discrimina­\ntory double taxation of income earned out of state and\ncreated a powerful incentive to engage in intrastate rather\nthan interstate economic activity. Although we did not\nuse the term in those cases, we held that those schemes\ncould be cured by taxes that satisfy what we have subse­\nquently labeled the “internal consistency” test. See Jeffer-\nson Lines, 514 U. S., at 185 (citing Gwin, White as a case\nrequiring internal consistency); see also 1 Trost §2:19, at\n122–123, and n. 160 (explaining that the internal con­\nsistency test has its origins in Western Live Stock, J. D.\nAdams, and Gwin, White). This test, which helps courts\nidentify tax schemes that discriminate against interstate\ncommerce, “looks to the structure of the tax at issue to see\nwhether its identical application by every State in the\nUnion would place interstate commerce at a disadvantage\n——————\n  4 There is no merit to petitioner’s argument that Maryland is free to\n\nadopt any tax scheme that is not actually intended to discriminate\nagainst interstate commerce.

S. 159, 169 (1983).\n   By hypothetically assuming that every State has the\nsame tax structure, the internal consistency test allows\ncourts to isolate the effect of a defendant State’s tax\nscheme. This is a virtue of the test because it allows\ncourts to distinguish between (1) tax schemes that inher­\nently discriminate against interstate commerce without\nregard to the tax policies of other States, and (2) tax\nschemes that create disparate incentives to engage in\ninterstate commerce (and sometimes result in double\ntaxation) only as a result of the interaction of two different\nbut nondiscriminatory and internally consistent schemes.\nSee Armco, supra, at 645–646; Moorman, 437 U.

The first category of\ntaxes is typically unconstitutional; the second is not.5 See\nArmco, supra, at 644–646; Moorman, supra, at 277, and\nn. 12. Tax schemes that fail the internal consistency test\nwill fall into the first category, not the second: “[A]ny\ncross-border tax disadvantage that remains after applica­\ntion of the [test] cannot be due to tax disparities”6 but is\ninstead attributable to the taxing State’s discriminatory\npolicies alone.\n——————\n  5 Our  cases have held that tax schemes may be invalid under the\ndormant Commerce Clause even absent a showing of actual double\ntaxation.

The\ninternal consistency test was formally introduced more\nthan three decades ago, see Container Corp., supra, and it\nhas been invoked in no fewer than seven cases, invalidat­\ning the tax in three of those cases. See American Trucking\nAssns., Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 545 U. S. 429\n(2005);7 Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175; Goldberg, 488\n——————\n   7 The principal dissent and JUSTICE SCALIA inaccurately state that\n\nthe Court in American Trucking “conceded that a trucking tax ‘fail[ed]\nthe “internal consistency” test,’ but upheld the tax anyway.” Post, at 5\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting); see also post, at 14–15 (GINSBURG, J., dissent­\ning). The Court did not say that the tax in question “failed the ‘internal\nconsistency test.’ ” The Court wrote that this is what petitioner argued.\nSee American Trucking, 545 U. S., at 437. And the Court did not\nconcede that this was true. The tax in that case was a flat tax on any\ntruck that made point-to-point deliveries in Michigan. The tax there­\nfore fell on all trucks that made solely intrastate deliveries and some\nthat made interstate deliveries, namely, those that also made some\nintrastate deliveries. What the Court “concede[d]” was that “if all\nStates [adopted a similar tax], an interstate truck would have to pay\nfees totaling several hundred dollars, or even several thousand dollars,\nwere it to ‘top off’ its business by carrying local loads in many (or even\nall) other States.” Id., at 438 (emphasis added). But that was not the\nsame as a concession that the tax violated the internal consistency test.\n  The internal consistency test asks whether the adoption of a rule by\nall States “would place interstate commerce at a disadvantage as\ncompared with commerce intrastate.” Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v.\nJefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 185 (1995). Whether the Michigan\ntrucking tax had such an effect depended on an empirical showing that\npetitioners failed to make, namely, that the challenged tax imposed a\nheavier burden on interstate truckers in general than it did on intra­\nstate truckers. Under the Michigan tax, some interstate truckers, i.e.,\nthose who used Michigan roads solely for trips that started and ended\noutside the State, did not pay this tax even though they benefited from\nthe use of the State’s roads; they were thus treated more favorably than\ntruckers who did not leave the State.

S. 638; Container Corp., supra.\n                             2\n  Maryland’s income tax scheme fails the internal con­\nsistency test.8 A simple example illustrates the point.\nAssume that every State imposed the following taxes,\nwhich are similar to Maryland’s “county” and “special\nnonresident” taxes: (1) a 1.25% tax on income that resi­\ndents earn in State, (2) a 1.25% tax on income that resi­\ndents earn in other jurisdictions, and (3) a 1.25% tax on\nincome that nonresidents earn in State. Assume further\nthat two taxpayers, April and Bob, both live in State A,\nbut that April earns her income in State A whereas Bob\nearns his income in State B. In this circumstance, Bob\n——————\nstate trips, i.e., those who made some intrastate trips, were treated less\nfavorably. As the United States explained in its brief, “[n]either record\nevidence nor abstract logic makes clear whether the overall effect of\nsuch a system would be to increase or to reduce existing financial\ndisincentives to interstate travel.” Brief for United States in American\nTrucking Assns., Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm’n, O. T. 2004, No.\n03–1230, p. 26.\n   8 In order to apply the internal consistency test in this case, we must\n\nevaluate the Maryland income tax scheme as a whole. That scheme\ntaxes three separate categories of income: (1) the “county tax” on\nincome that Maryland residents earn in Maryland; (2) the “county tax”\non income that Maryland residents earn in other States; and (3) the\n“special nonresident tax” on income that nonresidents earn in Mary­\nland. For Commerce Clause purposes, it is immaterial that Maryland\nassigns different labels (i.e., “county tax” and “special nonresident tax”)\nto these taxes. In applying the dormant Commerce Clause, they must\nbe considered as one. Cf. Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of\nEnvironmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 102–103 (1994) (independ­\nent taxes on intrastate and interstate commerce are “compensatory” if\nthey are rough equivalents imposed upon substantially similar events).\nIf state labels controlled, a State would always be free to tax domestic,\ninbound, and outbound income at discriminatory rates simply by\nattaching different labels.\n22     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwill pay more income tax than April solely because he\nearns income interstate. Specifically, April will have to\npay a 1.25% tax only once, to State A. But Bob will have\nto pay a 1.25% tax twice: once to State A, where he re­\nsides, and once to State B, where he earns the income.\n   Critically—and this dispels a central argument made by\npetitioner and the principal dissent—the Maryland\nscheme’s discriminatory treatment of interstate commerce\nis not simply the result of its interaction with the taxing\nschemes of other States. Instead, the internal consistency\ntest reveals what the undisputed economic analysis shows:\nMaryland’s tax scheme is inherently discriminatory and\noperates as a tariff. See Brief for Tax Economists 4, 9;\nBrief for Knoll & Mason 2. This identity between Mary­\nland’s tax and a tariff is fatal because tariffs are “[t]he\nparadigmatic example of a law discriminating against\ninterstate commerce.” West Lynn, 512 U. S., at 193.\nIndeed, when asked about the foregoing analysis made by\namici Tax Economists and Knoll & Mason, counsel for\nMaryland responded, “I don’t dispute the mathematics.\nThey lose me when they switch from tariffs to income\ntaxes.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 9. But Maryland has offered no\nreason why our analysis should change because we deal\nwith an income tax rather than a formal tariff, and we see\nnone. After all, “tariffs against the products of other\nStates are so patently unconstitutional that our cases\nreveal not a single attempt by any State to enact one.\nInstead, the cases are filled with state laws that aspire to\nreap some of the benefits of tariffs by other means.” West\nLynn, supra, at 193.\n   None of our dissenting colleagues dispute this economic\nanalysis. The principal dissent focuses instead on a sup­\nposed “oddity” with our analysis: The principal dissent can\nenvision other tax schemes that result in double taxation\nbut do not violate the internal consistency test. This\nwould happen, the principal dissent points out, if State A\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntaxed only based on residence and State B taxed only\nbased on source. Post, at 17 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting);\nsee also post, at 7 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Our prior\ndecisions have already considered and rejected this precise\nargument—and for good reason. For example, in Armco,\nwe struck down an internally inconsistent tax that posed a\nrisk of double taxation even though we recognized that\nthere might be other permissible arrangements that would\nresult in double taxation. Such schemes would be consti­\ntutional, we explained, because “such a result would not\narise from impermissible discrimination against interstate\ncommerce.” 467 U. S., at 645. The principal dissent’s\nprotest that our distinction is “entirely circular,” post, at\n17–18, n. 10, misunderstands the critical distinction,\nrecognized in cases like Armco, between discriminatory\ntax schemes and double taxation that results only from\nthe interaction of two different but nondiscriminatory tax\nschemes. See also Moorman, 437 U. S., at 277, n. 12\n(distinguishing “the potential consequences of the use of\ndifferent formulas by the two States,” which is not prohib­\nited by the Commerce Clause, from discrimination that\n“inhere[s] in either State’s formula,” which is prohibited).\n   Petitioner and the Solicitor General argue that Mary­\nland’s tax is neutral, not discriminatory, because the same\ntax applies to all three categories of income. Specifically,\nthey point out that the same tax is levied on (1) residents\nwho earn income in State, (2) residents who earn income\nout of State, and (3) nonresidents who earn income in\nState. But the fact that the tax might have “ ‘the ad­\nvantage of appearing nondiscriminatory’ does not save it\nfrom invalidation.” Tyler Pipe, 483 U. S., at 248 (quoting\nGeneral Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436, 460\n(1964) (Goldberg, J., dissenting)). See also American\nTrucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. at, 281\n(dormant Commerce Clause applies to state taxes even\nwhen they “do not allocate tax burdens between insiders\n24     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand outsiders in a manner that is facially discriminatory”);\nMaine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 138 (1986) (a state law\nmay discriminate against interstate commerce “ ‘either on\nits face or in practical effect’ ” (quoting Hughes, 441 U. S.,\nat 336)). In this case, the internal consistency test and\neconomic analysis—indeed, petitioner’s own concession—\nconfirm that the tax scheme operates as a tariff and dis­\ncriminates against interstate commerce, and so the\nscheme is invalid.\n   Petitioner and the principal dissent, post, at 6, also note\nthat by offering residents who earn income in interstate\ncommerce a credit against the “state” portion of the in­\ncome tax, Maryland actually receives less tax revenue\nfrom residents who earn income from interstate commerce\nrather than intrastate commerce. This argument is a red\nherring. The critical point is that the total tax burden on\ninterstate commerce is higher, not that Maryland may\nreceive more or less tax revenue from a particular tax­\npayer. See Armco, supra, at 642–645. Maryland’s tax un-\nconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce,\nand it is thus invalid regardless of how much a particular\ntaxpayer must pay to the taxing State.\n   Once again, a simple hypothetical illustrates the point.\nAssume that State A imposes a 5% tax on the income that\nits residents earn in-state but a 10% tax on income they\nearn in other jurisdictions. Assume also that State A\nhappens to grant a credit against income taxes paid to\nother States. Such a scheme discriminates against inter­\nstate commerce because it taxes income earned interstate\nat a higher rate than income earned intrastate. This is so\ndespite the fact that, in certain circumstances, a resident\nof State A who earns income interstate may pay less tax to\nState A than a neighbor who earns income intrastate. For\nexample, if Bob lives in State A but earns his income in\nState B, which has a 6% income tax rate, Bob would pay a\ntotal tax of 10% on his income, though 6% would go to\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nState B and (because of the credit) only 4% would go to\nState A. Bob would thus pay less to State A than his\nneighbor, April, who lives in State A and earns all of her\nincome there, because April would pay a 5% tax to State\nA. But Bob’s tax burden to State A is irrelevant; his total\ntax burden is what matters.\n   The principal dissent is left with two arguments against\nthe internal consistency test. These arguments are incon­\nsistent with each other and with our precedents.\n   First, the principal dissent claims that the analysis\noutlined above requires a State taxing based on residence\nto “recede” to a State taxing based on source. Post, at 1–2.\nWe establish no such rule of priority. To be sure, Mary­\nland could remedy the infirmity in its tax scheme by offer­\ning, as most States do, a credit against income taxes paid\nto other States. See Tyler Pipe, supra, at 245–246, and\nn. 13. If it did, Maryland’s tax scheme would survive the\ninternal consistency test and would not be inherently\ndiscriminatory. Tweak our first hypothetical, supra, at\n21–22, and assume that all States impose a 1.25% tax on\nall three categories of income but also allow a credit\nagainst income taxes that residents pay to other jurisdic­\ntions. In that circumstance, April (who lives and works in\nState A) and Bob (who lives in State A but works in State\nB) would pay the same tax. Specifically, April would pay a\n1.25% tax only once (to State A), and Bob would pay a\n1.25% tax only once (to State B, because State A would\ngive him a credit against the tax he paid to State B).\n   But while Maryland could cure the problem with its\ncurrent system by granting a credit for taxes paid to other\nStates, we do not foreclose the possibility that it could\ncomply with the Commerce Clause in some other way. See\nBrief for Tax Economists 32; Brief for Knoll & Mason 28–\n30. Of course, we do not decide the constitutionality of a\nhypothetical tax scheme that Maryland might adopt be­\ncause such a scheme is not before us. That Maryland’s\n26     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexisting tax unconstitutionally discriminates against\ninterstate commerce is enough to decide this case.\n   Second, the principal dissent finds a “deep flaw” with\nthe possibility that “Maryland could eliminate the incon­\nsistency [with its tax scheme] by terminating the special\nnonresident tax—a measure that would not help the\nWynnes at all.” Post, at 16. This second objection refutes\nthe first. By positing that Maryland could remedy the\nunconstitutionality of its tax scheme by eliminating the\nspecial nonresident tax, the principal dissent accepts that\nMaryland’s desire to tax based on residence need not\n“recede” to another State’s desire to tax based on source.\n   Moreover, the principal dissent’s supposed flaw is simply\na truism about every case under the dormant Commerce\nClause (not to mention the Equal Protection Clause):\nWhenever government impermissibly treats like cases\ndifferently, it can cure the violation by either “leveling up”\nor “leveling down.” Whenever a State impermissibly taxes\ninterstate commerce at a higher rate than intrastate\ncommerce, that infirmity could be cured by lowering the\nhigher rate, raising the lower rate, or a combination of the\ntwo. For this reason, we have concluded that “a State\nfound to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory\ntax retains flexibility in responding to this determination.”\nMcKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and\nTobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18,\n39–40 (1990). See also Associated Industries of Mo. v.\nLohman, 511 U. S. 641, 656 (1994); Fulton Corp., 516\nU. S., at 346–347. If every claim that suffers from this\n“flaw” cannot succeed, no dormant Commerce Clause or\nequal protection claim could ever succeed.\n                              G\n  JUSTICE SCALIA would uphold the constitutionality of\nthe Maryland tax scheme because the dormant Commerce\nClause, in his words, is “a judicial fraud.” Post, at 2. That\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas not the view of the Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9\nWheat, at 209, where Chief Justice Marshall wrote that\nthere was “great force” in the argument that the Com­\nmerce Clause by itself limits the power of the States to\nenact laws regulating interstate commerce. Since that\ntime, this supposedly fraudulent doctrine has been applied\nin dozens of our opinions, joined by dozens of Justices.\nPerhaps for this reason, petitioner in this case, while\nchallenging the interpretation and application of that\ndoctrine by the court below, did not ask us to reconsider\nthe doctrine’s validity.\n  JUSTICE SCALIA does not dispute the fact that State\ntariffs were among the principal problems that led to the\nadoption of the Constitution. See post, at 3. Nor does he\ndispute the fact that the Maryland tax scheme is tanta­\nmount to a tariff on work done out of State. He argues,\nhowever, that the Constitution addresses the problem of\nstate tariffs by prohibiting States from imposing “ ‘Imposts\nor Duties on Imports or Exports.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Art. I,\n§10, cl. 2). But he does not explain why, under his inter­\npretation of the Constitution, the Import-Export Clause\nwould not lead to the same result that we reach under the\ndormant Commerce Clause. Our cases have noted the\nclose relationship between the two provisions. See, e.g.,\nState Tonnage Tax Cases, 12 Wall. 204, 214 (1871).\n  JUSTICE THOMAS also refuses to accept the dormant\nCommerce Clause doctrine, and he suggests that the\nConstitution was ratified on the understanding that it\nwould not prevent a State from doing what Maryland has\ndone here. He notes that some States imposed income\ntaxes at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, and\nhe observes that “[t]here is no indication that those early\nstate income tax schemes provided credits for income\ntaxes paid elsewhere.” Post, at 2 (dissenting opinion). “It\nseems highly implausible,” he writes, “that those who\nratified the Commerce Clause understood it to conflict\n28     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the income tax laws of their States and nonetheless\nadopted it without a word of concern.” Ibid. This argu­\nment is plainly unsound.\n   First, because of the difficulty of interstate travel, the\nnumber of individuals who earned income out of State in\n1787 was surely very small. (We are unaware of records\nshowing, for example, that it was common in 1787 for\nworkers to commute to Manhattan from New Jersey by\nrowboat or from Connecticut by stagecoach.)\n   Second, JUSTICE THOMAS has not shown that the small\nnumber of individuals who earned income out of State\nwere taxed twice on that income. A number of Founding-\nera income tax schemes appear to have taxed only the\nincome of residents, not nonresidents. For example, in his\nreport to Congress on direct taxes, Oliver Wolcott, Jr.,\nSecretary of Treasury, describes Delaware’s income tax as\nbeing imposed only on “the inhabitants of this State,” and\nhe makes no mention of the taxation of nonresidents’\nincome. Report to 4th Cong., 2d Sess. (1796), concerning\nDirect Taxes, in 1 American State Papers, Finance 429\n(1832). JUSTICE THOMAS likewise understands that the\nMassachusetts and Delaware income taxes were imposed\nonly on residents. Post, at 2, n. These tax schemes, of\ncourse, pass the internal consistency test. Moreover, the\ndifficulty of administering an income tax on nonresidents\nwould have diminished the likelihood of double taxation.\nSee R. Blakey, State Income Taxation 1 (1930).\n   Third, even if some persons were taxed twice, it is un­\nlikely that this was a matter of such common knowledge\nthat it must have been known by the delegates to the\nState ratifying conventions who voted to adopt the\nConstitution.\n                        *    *   *\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nof Maryland is affirmed.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

It does this by invoking the negative Com-\nmerce Clause, a judge-invented rule under which judges\nmay set aside state laws that they think impose too much\nof a burden upon interstate commerce. I join the principal\ndissent, which demonstrates the incompatibility of this\ndecision with our prior negative Commerce Clause cases.\nPost, at 2–14 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). Incompatibility,\nhowever, is not the test for me—though what is incompat-\nible with our cases a fortiori fails my test as well, as dis-\ncussed briefly in Part III below. The principal purpose of\nmy writing separately is to point out how wrong our nega-\ntive Commerce Clause jurisprudence is in the first place,\nand how well today’s decision illustrates its error.\n                            I\n  The fundamental problem with our negative Commerce\nClause cases is that the Constitution does not contain a\nnegative Commerce Clause. It contains only a Commerce\nClause. Unlike the negative Commerce Clause adopted by\nthe judges, the real Commerce Clause adopted by the\nPeople merely empowers Congress to “regulate Commerce\n2      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v.

The Clause says\nnothing about prohibiting state laws that burden com-\nmerce. Much less does it say anything about authorizing\njudges to set aside state laws they believe burden com-\nmerce. The clearest sign that the negative Commerce\nClause is a judicial fraud is the utterly illogical holding\nthat congressional consent enables States to enact laws\nthat would otherwise constitute impermissible burdens\nupon interstate commerce.

How could\ncongressional consent lift a constitutional prohibition?\nSee License Cases, 5 How. 504, 580 (1847) (opinion of\nTaney, C. J.).\n  The Court’s efforts to justify this judicial economic veto\ncome to naught. The Court claims that the doctrine “has\ndeep roots.” Ante, at 5. So it does, like many weeds. But\nage alone does not make up for brazen invention. And the\ndoctrine in any event is not quite as old as the Court\nmakes it seem. The idea that the Commerce Clause of its\nown force limits state power “finds no expression” in dis-\ncussions surrounding the Constitution’s ratification. F.\nFrankfurter, The Commerce Clause Under Marshall,\nTaney and Waite 13 (1937). For years after the adoption\nof the Constitution, States continually made regulations\nthat burdened interstate commerce (like pilotage laws and\nquarantine laws) without provoking any doubts about\ntheir constitutionality. License Cases, supra, at 580–581.\nThis Court’s earliest allusions to a negative Commerce\nClause came only in dicta—ambiguous dicta, at that—and\nwere vigorously contested at the time. See, e.g., id., at\n581–582. Our first clear holding setting aside a state law\nunder the negative Commerce Clause came after the Civil\nWar, more than 80 years after the Constitution’s adoption.\nCase of the State Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232 (1873). Since\nthen, we have tended to revamp the doctrine every couple\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nof decades upon finding existing decisions unworkable\nor unsatisfactory. See Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504\nU. S. 298, 309 (1992). The negative Commerce Clause\napplied today has little in common with the negative\nCommerce Clause of the 19th century, except perhaps for\nincoherence.\n  The Court adds that “tariffs and other laws that bur-\ndened interstate commerce” were among “the chief evils\nthat led to the adoption of the Constitution.” Ante, at 5.\nThis line of reasoning forgets that interpretation requires\nheeding more than the Constitution’s purposes; it requires\nheeding the means the Constitution uses to achieve those\npurposes. The Constitution addresses the evils of local\nimpediments to commerce by prohibiting States from\nimposing certain especially burdensome taxes—“Imposts\nor Duties on Imports or Exports” and “Dut[ies] of Ton-\nnage”—without congressional consent. Art. I, §10, cls.\n2–3. It also addresses these evils by giving Congress a com-\nmerce power under which it may prohibit other burden-\nsome taxes and laws. As the Constitution’s text shows,\nhowever, it does not address these evils by empowering\nthe judiciary to set aside state taxes and laws that it\ndeems too burdensome. By arrogating this power anyway,\nour negative Commerce Clause cases have disrupted the\nbalance the Constitution strikes between the goal of pro-\ntecting commerce and competing goals like preserving\nlocal autonomy and promoting democratic responsibility.\n                            II\n  The failings of negative Commerce Clause doctrine go\nbeyond its lack of a constitutional foundation, as today’s\ndecision well illustrates.\n\n   1. One glaring defect of the negative Commerce Clause\nis its lack of governing principle. Neither the Constitution\nnor our legal traditions offer guidance about how to sepa-\n4      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nrate improper state interference with commerce from\npermissible state taxation or regulation of commerce. So\nwe must make the rules up as we go along. That is how\nwe ended up with the bestiary of ad hoc tests and ad hoc\nexceptions that we apply nowadays, including the sub-\nstantial nexus test, the fair apportionment test, and the\nfair relation test, Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady,\n430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977), the interest-on-state-bonds\nexception, Department of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis, 553\nU. S. 328, 353–356 (2008), and the sales-taxes-on-mail-\norders exception, Quill Corp., supra, at 314–319.\n   The internal consistency rule invoked by the Court\nnicely showcases our ad hocery. Under this rule, a tax\nviolates the Constitution if its hypothetical adoption by all\nStates would interfere with interstate commerce. Ante, at\n19. How did this exercise in counterfactuals find its way\ninto our basic charter? The test, it is true, bears some\nresemblance to Kant’s first formulation of the categorical\nimperative: “Act only according to that maxim whereby\nyou can at the same time will that it should become a\nuniversal law” without contradiction. Grounding for the\nMetaphysics of Morals 30 (J. Ellington transl. 3d ed.\n1993). It bears no resemblance, however, to anything in\nthe text or structure of the Constitution. Nor can one\ndiscern an obligation of internal consistency from our legal\ntraditions, which show that States have been imposing\ninternally inconsistent taxes for quite a while—until\nrecently with our approval. See, e.g., General Motors\nCorp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436 (1964) (upholding\ninternally inconsistent business activities tax); Hinson v.\nLott, 8 Wall. 148 (1869) (upholding internally inconsistent\nliquor tax). No, the only justification for the test seems to\nbe that this Court disapproves of “ ‘cross-border tax disad-\nvantage[s]’ ” when created by internally inconsistent taxes,\nbut is willing to tolerate them when created by “the inter-\naction of . . . internally consistent schemes.” Ante, at 19.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)              5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n“Whatever it is we are expounding in this area, it is not\na Constitution.”    American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.\nSmith, 496 U. S. 167, 203 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment).\n\n   2. Another conspicuous feature of the negative Com-\nmerce Clause is its instability. Because no principle an-\nchors our development of this doctrine—and because the\nline between wise regulation and burdensome interference\nchanges from age to economic age—one can never tell\nwhen the Court will make up a new rule or throw away an\nold one. “Change is almost [the doctrine’s] natural state,\nas it is the natural state of legislation in a constantly\nchanging national economy.” Ibid.\n   Today’s decision continues in this proud tradition.\nConsider a few ways in which it contradicts earlier\ndecisions:\n   In an earlier case, the Court conceded that a trucking\n    tax “fail[ed] the ‘internal consistency’ test,” but upheld\n    the tax anyway. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.\n    Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 545 U. S. 429, 437\n    (2005). Now, the Court proclaims that an income tax\n    “fails the internal consistency test,” and for that rea-\n    son strikes it down. Ante, at 21.\n   In an earlier case, the Court concluded that “[i]t is not\n    a purpose of the Commerce Clause to protect state\n    residents from their own state taxes” and that resi-\n    dents could “complain about and change the tax\n    through the [State’s] political process.” Goldberg v.\n    Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 266 (1989). Now, the Court con-\n    cludes that the negative Commerce Clause operates\n    “regardless of whether the plaintiff is a resident . . . or\n    nonresident” and that “the notion that [residents]\n    have a complete remedy at the polls is fanciful.” Ante,\n    at 11, 12.\n6        COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n     In an earlier case, the Court said that “[t]he difference\n      in effect between a tax measured by gross receipts\n      and one measured by net income . . . is manifest and\n      substantial.” United States Glue Co. v. Town of Oak\n      Creek, 247 U. S. 321, 328 (1918). Now, the Court says\n      that the “formal distinction” between taxes on net and\n      gross income “should [not] matter.” Ante, at 7.\n     In an earlier case, the Court upheld a tax despite its\n      economic similarity to the gross-receipts tax struck\n      down in Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 334\n      U. S. 653 (1948). Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Jefferson\n      Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 190–191 (1995). The Court\n      explained that “economic equivalence alone has . . .\n      not been (and should not be) the touchstone of Com-\n      merce Clause jurisprudence.” Id., at 196–197, n. 7.\n      Now, the Court strikes down a tax in part because of\n      its economic similarity to the gross-receipts tax struck\n      down in Central Greyhound. Ante, at 7. The Court\n      explains that “we must consider ‘not the formal lan-\n      guage of the tax statute but rather its practical ef-\n      fect.’ ” Ante, at 7–8.\n    So much for internal consistency.\n\n   3. A final defect of our Synthetic Commerce Clause\ncases is their incompatibility with the judicial role. The\ndoctrine does not call upon us to perform a conventional\njudicial function, like interpreting a legal text, discerning\na legal tradition, or even applying a stable body of prece-\ndents. It instead requires us to balance the needs of com-\nmerce against the needs of state governments. That is a\ntask for legislators, not judges.\n   Today’s enterprise of eliminating double taxation puts\nthis problem prominently on display. The one sure way to\neliminate all double taxation is to prescribe uniform na-\ntional tax rules—for example, to allow taxation of income\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nonly where earned. But a program of prescribing a na-\ntional tax code plainly exceeds the judicial competence. (It\nmay even exceed the legislative competence to come up\nwith a uniform code that accounts for the many political\nand economic differences among the States.) As an alter-\nnative, we could consider whether a State’s taxes in prac-\ntice overlap too much with the taxes of other States. But\nany such approach would drive us “to the perplexing in-\nquiry, so unfit for the judicial department, what degree of\ntaxation is the legitimate use, and what degree may\namount to an abuse of power.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4\nWheat. 316, 430 (1819). The Court today chooses a third\napproach, prohibiting States from imposing internally\ninconsistent taxes. Ante, at 19. But that rule avoids\ndouble taxation only in the hypothetical world where all\nStates adopt the same internally consistent tax, not in the\nreal world where different States might adopt different\ninternally consistent taxes. For example, if Maryland\nimposes its income tax on people who live in Maryland\nregardless of where they work (one internally consistent\nscheme), while Virginia imposes its income tax on people\nwho work in Virginia regardless of where they live (an-\nother internally consistent scheme), Marylanders who work\nin Virginia still face double taxation. Post, at 17–18.\nThen again, it is only fitting that the Imaginary Com-\nmerce Clause would lead to imaginary benefits.\n                             III\n  For reasons of stare decisis, I will vote to set aside a tax\nunder the negative Commerce Clause if (but only if) it\ndiscriminates on its face against interstate commerce or\ncannot be distinguished from a tax this Court has already\nheld unconstitutional. American Trucking Assns., 545\nU. S., at 439 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). The\nincome tax before us does not discriminate on its face\nagainst interstate commerce; a resident pays no less to\n8      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nMaryland when he works in Maryland than when he\nworks elsewhere. Neither is the tax before us indistin-\nguishable from one that we have previously held unconsti-\ntutional. To the contrary, as the principal dissent estab-\nlishes, our prior cases validate this tax.\n                         *  *     *\n  Maryland’s refusal to give residents full tax credits\nagainst income taxes paid to other States has its disad-\nvantages. It threatens double taxation and encourages\nresidents to work in Maryland. But Maryland’s law also\nhas its advantages. It allows the State to collect equal\nrevenue from taxpayers with equal incomes, avoids the\nadministrative burdens of verifying tax payments to other\nStates, and ensures that every resident pays the State at\nleast some income tax. Nothing in the Constitution pre-\ncludes Maryland from deciding that the benefits of its tax\nscheme are worth the costs.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

S. 564, 610–612 (1997)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting). For that reason, I would uphold\nMaryland’s tax scheme.\n   In reaching the contrary conclusion, the Court proves\njust how far our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence\nhas departed from the actual Commerce Clause. Accord-\ning to the majority, a state income tax that fails to provide\nresidents with “a full credit against the income taxes that\nthey pay to other States” violates the Commerce Clause.\nAnte, at 1. That news would have come as a surprise to\nthose who penned and ratified the Constitution. As this\nCourt observed some time ago, “Income taxes . . . were\nimposed by several of the States at or shortly after the\nadoption of the Federal Constitution.” Shaffer v. Carter,\n2       COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n252 U. S. 37, 51 (1920).* There is no indication that those\nearly state income tax schemes provided credits for income\ntaxes paid elsewhere. Thus, under the majority’s reason-\ning, all of those state laws would have contravened the\nnewly ratified Commerce Clause.\n   It seems highly implausible that those who ratified the\nCommerce Clause understood it to conflict with the in-\ncome tax laws of their States and nonetheless adopted it\nwithout a word of concern. That silence is particularly\ndeafening given the importance of such taxes for raising\nrevenues at the time. See Kinsman, The Income Tax in\nthe Commonwealths of the United States 7, in 4 Publica-\ntions of the American Economic Assn. (1903) (noting, for\nexample, that “Connecticut from her earliest history had\nfollowed the plan of taxing incomes rather than property”\nand that “[t]he total assessed value of [taxable] incomes in\nConnecticut in the year 1795 was a little over $300,000”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   In other areas of constitutional analysis, we would have\nconsidered these laws to be powerful evidence of the origi-\nnal understanding of the Constitution.

Chickasaw Nation, 515\nU. S. 450, 462–463 (1995). In accord with this principle,\nthe Court has regularly rejected claims that taxes on a\nresident’s out-of-state income violate the Due Process\nClause for lack of a sufficient “connection” to the taxing\nState. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U. S. 298, 306\n(1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Law-\nrence v. State Tax Comm’n of Miss., 286 U. S. 276, 281\n(1932). But under dormant Commerce Clause jurispru-\ndence, the Court decides, a State is not really empowered\nto tax a resident’s income from whatever source derived.\nIn taxing personal income, the Court holds, source-based\nauthority, i.e., authority to tax commerce conducted within\na State’s territory, boxes in the taxing authority of a tax-\npayer’s domicile.\n   As I see it, nothing in the Constitution or in prior deci-\nsions of this Court dictates that one of two States, the\ndomiciliary State or the source State, must recede simply\nbecause both have lawful tax regimes reaching the same\n2      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nincome. See Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267,\n277, n. 12 (1978) (finding no “discriminat[ion] against\ninterstate commerce” where alleged taxation disparities\nwere “the consequence of the combined effect” of two other-\nwise lawful income-tax schemes). True, Maryland elected\nto deny a credit for income taxes paid to other States in\ncomputing a resident’s county tax liability. It is equally\ntrue, however, that the other States that taxed the\nWynnes’ income elected not to offer them a credit for their\nMaryland county income taxes. In this situation, the\nConstitution does not prefer one lawful basis for state\ntaxation of a person’s income over the other. Nor does\nit require one State, in this case Maryland, to limit its\nresidence-based taxation, should the State also choose to\nexercise, to the full extent, its source-based authority.\nStates often offer their residents credits for income taxes\npaid to other States, as Maryland does for state income\ntax purposes. States do so, however, as a matter of tax\n“policy,” Chickasaw Nation, 515 U. S., at 463, n. 12 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted), not because the Constitu-\ntion compels that course.\n                              I\n   For at least a century, “domicile” has been recognized as\na secure ground for taxation of residents’ worldwide in-\ncome. Lawrence, 286 U. S., at 279. “Enjoyment of the\nprivileges of residence within [a] state, and the attendant\nright to invoke the protection of its laws,” this Court has\nexplained, “are inseparable from the responsibility for\nsharing the costs of government.” Ibid. “A tax measured\nby the net income of residents is an equitable method of\ndistributing the burdens of government among those who\nare privileged to enjoy its benefits.” New York ex rel. Cohn\nv. Graves, 300 U. S. 308, 313 (1937).\n   More is given to the residents of a State than to those\nwho reside elsewhere, therefore more may be demanded of\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

With this Court’s approbation, States have long\nfavored their residents over nonresidents in the provision\nof local services. See Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429,\n442 (1980) (such favoritism does not violate the Commerce\nClause). See also Martinez v. Bynum, 461 U. S. 321 (1983)\n(upholding residency requirements for free primary and\nsecondary schooling). The cost of services residents enjoy\nis substantial. According to the State’s Comptroller, for\nexample, in 2012 Maryland and its local governments\nspent over $11 billion to fund public schools, $4 billion for\nstate health programs, and $1.1 billion for the State’s food\nsupplemental program—all programs available to resi-\ndents only. Brief for Petitioner 20–23. See also Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 18 (Howard County—\nwhere the Wynnes lived in 2006—budgeted more than\n$903 million for education in fiscal year 2014). Excluding\nnonresidents from these services, this Court has observed,\nis rational for it is residents “who fund the state treasury\nand whom the State was created to serve.” Reeves, 447\nU. S., at 442. A taxpayer’s home State, then, can hardly\nbe faulted for making support of local government activi-\nties an obligation of every resident, regardless of any\nobligations residents may have to other States.1\n   Residents, moreover, possess political means, not shared\nby outsiders, to ensure that the power to tax their income\nis not abused. “It is not,” this Court has observed, “a\npurpose of the Commerce Clause to protect state residents\nfrom their own state taxes.” Goldberg v.

But I fail to see how it answers, or is even\nrelevant to, my observation that affording residents greater benefits\nentitles a State to require that they bear a greater tax burden.\n4        COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v.

Nonresidents, by contrast, are not similarly posi-\ntioned to “effec[t] legislative change.” Ibid. As Chief\nJustice Marshall, developer of the Court’s Commerce\nClause jurisprudence, reasoned: “In imposing a tax the\nlegislature acts upon its constituents. This is in general a\nsufficient security against erroneous and oppressive taxa-\ntion.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 428 (1819).\nThe “people of a State” can thus “res[t] confidently on the\ninterest of the legislator, and on the influence of the con-\nstituents over their representative, to guard them against\n. . . abuse” of the “right of taxing themselves and their\nproperty.” Ibid.2\n    I hardly maintain, as the majority insistently asserts I\ndo, that “the Commerce Clause places no constraint on a\nState’s power to tax” its residents.

This Court has not shied away from strik-\ning down or closely scrutinizing state efforts to tax resi-\ndents at a higher rate for out-of-state activities than for in-\nstate activities (or to exempt from taxation only in-state\nactivities). See, e.g., Department of Revenue of Ky. v.\nDavis, 553 U. S. 328, 336 (2008); Camps Newfound/\nOwatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.

S. 186, 203 (1994). Ante, at 11–\n12. That is doubly wrong. In Goldberg, we distinguished the tax struck\ndown in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266\n(1987) (ATA I), noting, in particular, that the tax in ATA I fell on “out-\nof-state[rs]” whereas the tax in Goldberg fell on “the insider who\npresumably is able to complain about and change the tax through the\nIllinois political process.” 488 U. S., at 266. Essential to our holding,\nthis rationale cannot be written off as “dictum.” As for West Lynn\nCreamery, far from “repudiat[ing]” Goldberg, the Court cited Goldberg\nand reaffirmed its political safeguards rationale, as explained below.\nSee infra this page and 5.\n                    Cite as: 575 U.

Healy, 512 U. S. 186, 200\n(1994). By contrast, the Court has generally upheld “even-\nhanded tax[es] . . . in spite of any adverse effects on\ninterstate commerce, in part because ‘[t]he existence of\nmajor in-state interests adversely affected . . . is a power-\nful safeguard against legislative abuse.’ ” Ibid. (citing,\ninter alia, Goldberg, 488 U. S., at 266). That justification\napplies with full force to the “evenhanded tax” challenged\nhere, which taxes residents’ income at the same rate\nwhether earned in-state or out-of-state.3\n  These rationales for a State taxing its residents’ world-\nwide income are not diminished by another State’s inde-\npendent interest in “requiring contributions from [nonres-\nidents] who realize current pecuniary benefits under the\nprotection of the [State’s] government.” Shaffer v.

WYNNE\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nboth States’ governments.\n  States deciding whether to tax residents’ entire world-\nwide income must choose between legitimate but compet-\ning tax policy objectives. A State might prioritize obtain-\ning equal contributions from those who benefit from the\nState’s protection in roughly similar ways. Or a State\nmight prioritize ensuring that its taxpayers are not sub-\nject to double taxation. A State cannot, however, accom-\nplish both objectives at once.\n  To illustrate, consider the Wynnes. Under the tax\nscheme in place in 2006, other Howard County residents\nwho earned their income in-state but who otherwise had\nthe same tax profile as the Wynnes (e.g., $2.67 million in\ntaxable net income) owed the same amount of taxes to\nMaryland as the Wynnes. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A–56.\nThe scheme thus ensured that all residents with similar\naccess to the State’s protection and benefits and similar\nability to pay made equal contributions to the State to\ndefray the costs of those benefits. Maryland could not\nachieve that objective, however, without exposing the\nWynnes to a risk of double taxation. Conversely, the\nCourt prioritizes reducing the risk that the Wynnes’ in-\ncome will be taxed twice by two different States. But that\nchoice comes at a cost: The Wynnes enjoyed equal access\nto the State’s services but will have paid $25,000 less to\ncover the costs of those services than similarly situated\nneighbors who earned their income entirely within the\nState. See Pet. for Cert. 15.\n  States confront the same trade-off when deciding\nwhether to tax nonresidents’ entire in-state income. A\nState can require all residents and nonresidents who work\nwithin the State under its protection to contribute equally\nto the cost of that protection. Or the State can seek to\navoid exposing its workers to any risk of double taxation.\nBut it cannot achieve both objectives.\n  For at least a century, responsibility for striking the\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

See ante, at 17. But since almost the\ndawn of the modern era of state income taxation, other\nStates have taken the same approach as Maryland does\nnow, taxing residents’ entire income, wherever earned,\nwhile at the same time taxing nonresidents’ entire in-state\nincome. And recognizing that “[p]rotection, benefit, and\npower over [a taxpayer’s income] are not confined to ei-\nther” the State of residence or the State in which income is\nearned, this Court has long afforded States that flexibility.\nCurry v. McCanless, 307 U. S. 357, 368 (1939). This history\nof States imposing and this Court upholding income tax\nschemes materially identical to the one the Court con-\nfronts here should be the beginning and end of this case.\n   The modern era of state income taxation dates from a\nWisconsin tax enacted in 1911. See 1911 Wis. Laws ch.\n658; R. Blakey, State Income Taxation 1 (1930). From\nclose to the start of this modern era, States have taxed\nresidents and nonresidents in ways materially indistin-\nguishable from the way Maryland does now. In 1915, for\nexample, Oklahoma began taxing residents’ “entire net\nincome . . . arising or accruing from all sources,” while at\nthe same time taxing nonresidents’ “entire net income\nfrom [sources] in th[e] State.” 1915 Okla. Sess. Laws\nch. 164, §1, pp. 232–233 (emphasis added). Like Maryland\ntoday, Oklahoma provided no credit to either residents or\nnonresidents for taxes paid elsewhere. See id., ch. 164, §1\net seq., at 232–237. In 1917, neighboring Missouri adopted\na similar scheme: Residents owed taxes on their “entire\nnet income . . . from all sources” and nonresidents owed\ntaxes on their “entire net income . . . from all sources\nwithin th[e] state.” 1917 Mo. Laws §1(a), pp. 524–525\n(emphasis added). Missouri too provided neither residents\nnor nonresidents a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdic-\n8         COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ntions. See id., §1 et seq., at 524–538. Thus, much like\nMaryland today, these early income tax adopters simulta-\nneously taxed residents on all income, wherever earned,\nand nonresidents on all income earned within the State.4\n   Almost immediately, this Court began issuing what\nbecame a long series of decisions, repeatedly upholding\nStates’ authority to tax both residents’ worldwide income\nand nonresidents’ in-state income. E.g., Maguire v. Trefry,\n253 U. S. 12, 17 (1920) (resident income tax); Shaffer, 252\nU. S., at 52–53, 57 (nonresident income tax). See also\nState Tax Comm’n of Utah v. Aldrich, 316 U. S. 174, 178\n(1942); Curry, 307 U. S., at 368; Guaranty Trust Co. v.\nVirginia, 305 U. S. 19, 23 (1938); Graves, 300 U. S., at 313;\nLawrence, 286 U. S., at 281. By the end of the 20th cen-\ntury, it was “a well-established principle of interstate and\ninternational taxation” that “sovereigns have authority to\ntax all income of their residents, including income earned\noutside their borders,” Chickasaw Nation, 515 U. S., at\n462, 463, n. 12, and that sovereigns generally may also tax\nnonresidents on “income earned within the [sovereign’s]\njurisdiction,” id., at 463, n. 11.\n   Far from suggesting that States must choose between\ntaxing residents or nonresidents, this Court specifically\naffirmed that the exact same “income may be taxed [si-\nmultaneously] both by the state where it is earned and by\nthe state of the recipient’s domicile.” Curry, 307 U. S., at\n——————\n    4 Unlike Maryland’s county income tax, these early 20th-century\nincome taxes allowed a deduction for taxes paid to other jurisdictions.\nCompare App. 18 with 1917 Mo. Laws §5, pp. 526–527, and 1915 Okla.\nSess. Laws §6, p. 234. The Wynnes have not argued and the majority\ndoes not suggest, however, that Maryland could fully cure the asserted\ndefects in its tax “scheme” simply by providing a deduction, in lieu of a\ntax credit. And I doubt that such a deduction would give the Wynnes\nmuch satisfaction: Deducting taxes paid to other States from the\nWynnes’ $2.67 million taxable net income would reduce their Maryland\ntax burden by a small fraction of the $25,000 tax credit the majority\nawards them.

See also Aldrich, 316 U. S., at 176–\n178, 181 (rejecting “a rule of immunity from taxation by\nmore than one state,” including with respect to income\ntaxation (internal quotation marks omitted)). In Law-\nrence, for example, this Court dealt with a Mississippi tax\n“scheme” with the same structure Maryland has today:\nMississippi taxed residents on all income, wherever\nearned, and nonresidents on income earned within the\nState, without providing either set of taxpayers a credit\nfor taxes paid elsewhere. See 286 U. S., at 278–279; Miss.\nCode Ann. §5033(a), (b)(9) (1930). Lawrence upheld a\nMississippi tax on net income earned by one of its resi-\ndents on the construction of public highways in Tennessee.\nSee 286 U. S., at 279–281. The Court did so fully aware\nthat both Mississippi and Tennessee were effectively\nimposing “an income tax upon the same occupation.”\nReply Brief in Lawrence v. State Tax Comm’n of Miss.,\nO. T. 1931, No. 580, p. 32. See also Curry, 307 U. S., at\n363, n. 1, 368 (discussing Lawrence).\n  Likewise, in Guaranty Trust, both New York and Vir-\nginia had taxed income of a New York trust that had been\ndistributed to a Virginia resident. 305 U. S., at 21–22.\nThe resident sought to block Virginia’s tax in order to\navoid “double taxation” of the “identical income.” Id., at\n22. Rejecting that challenge, the Court once again reiter-\nated that “two States” may simultaneously tax the “same\nincome.” Ibid.\n  The majority deems these cases irrelevant because they\ninvolved challenges brought under the Due Process\nClause, not the Commerce Clause. See ante, at 12–15.\nThese cases are significant, however, not because the\nconstraints imposed by the two Clauses are identical.\nObviously, they are not. See Quill Corp., 504 U. S., at 305.\nWhat the sheer volume and consistency of this precedent\nconfirms, rather, is the degree to which this Court has—\nuntil now—endorsed the “well-established principle of\n10      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ninterstate and international taxation” that a State may\ntax its residents’ worldwide income, without restriction\narising from the source-based taxes imposed by other\nStates and regardless of whether the State also chooses to\nimpose source-based taxes of its own. Chickasaw Nation,\n515 U. S., at 462.5\n   In any event, it is incorrect that support for this princi-\nple is limited to the Court’s Due Process Clause cases. In\nShaffer, for example, this Court rejected both a Due Pro-\ncess Clause challenge and a dormant Commerce Clause\nchallenge to an income tax “scheme” (the Oklahoma stat-\nute described above) with the very features the majority\nlatches onto today: Oklahoma taxed residents on all\nworldwide income and nonresidents on all in-state income,\nwithout providing a credit for taxes paid elsewhere to\neither residents or nonresidents. 252 U. S., at 52–53 (Due\nProcess challenge); id., at 57 (dormant Commerce Clause\nchallenge). See also supra, at 7. The specific tax chal-\nlenged in Shaffer—a tax on a nonresident’s in-state in-\ncome—exposed taxpayers to the same risk of double taxa-\ntion as the Maryland tax challenged in this case. The\nmajority labors mightily to distinguish Shaffer, but it does\nnot dispute the one thing that ought to give it pause:\nToday’s decision overrules Shaffer’s dormant Commerce\nClause holding. See ante, at 15–16. I would not discard\nour precedents so lightly. Just as the tax in Shaffer en-\ncountered no constitutional shoals, so Maryland’s scheme\nshould survive the Court’s inspection.\n——————\n  5 Upholding   Maryland’s facially neutral tax hardly means, as the\nmajority contends, ante, at 12, that the dormant Commerce Clause\nplaces no limits on States’ authority to tax residents’ worldwide income.\nThere are, for example, no well-established principles of interstate and\ninternational taxation permitting the kind of facially discriminatory tax\nthe majority “[i]magine[s]” a State enacting.

In West Publishing, the Court summarily affirmed a\ndecision of the California Supreme Court that denied a\ndormant Commerce Clause challenge based on the princi-\nples today’s majority disrespects:\n    “[T]here [is no] merit to the contention that [Califor-\n    nia’s tax] discriminates against interstate commerce\n    on the ground that it subjects part of plaintiff ’s in-\n    come to double taxation, given the taxability of plain-\n    tiff ’s entire net income in the state of its domicile.\n    Taxation in one state is not an immunization against\n    taxation in other states. Taxation by states in which\n    a corporation carries on business activities is justified\n    by the advantages that attend the pursuit of such ac-\n    tivities. Income may be taxed both by the state where\n    it is earned and by the state of the recipient’s domi-\n    cile. Protection, benefit and power over the subject\n    matter are not confined to either state.” 27 Cal. 2d\n    705, 710–711, 166 P. 2d 861, 864 (1946) (citations and\n    internal quotation marks omitted).\nIn treating the matter summarily, the Court rejected an\nargument strikingly similar to the one the majority now\nembraces: that California’s tax violated the dormant\nCommerce Clause because it subjected “interstate com-\nmerce . . . to the risk of a double tax burden.” Brief for\nAppellant Opposing Motion to Dismiss or Affirm in West\nPublishing Co. v.

S. 307,\n311 (1938)).\n  The long history just recounted counsels in favor of\nrespecting States’ authority to tax without discount its\nresidents’ worldwide income. As Justice Holmes stated\nover a century ago, in regard to a “mode of taxation . . . of\nlong standing, . . . the fact that the system has been in\n12     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v.

City of New York, 211 U. S. 446, 448\n(1908). Only recently, this Court followed that sound\nadvice in resisting a dormant Commerce Clause challenge\nto a taxing practice with a pedigree as enduring as the\npractice in this case. See Department of Revenue of Ky. v.\nDavis, 553 U. S. 328, 356–357 (2008) (quoting Padell, 211\nU. S., at 448). Surely that advice merits application here,\nwhere the challenged tax draws support from both histori-\ncal practice and numerous decisions of this Court.\n   The majority rejects Justice Holmes’ counsel, observing\nthat most States, over time, have chosen not to exercise\nplenary authority to tax residents’ worldwide income. See\nante, at 17–18. The Court, however, learns the wrong\nlesson from the “independent policy decision[s]” States\nhave made. Chickasaw, 515 U. S., at 463, n. 12 (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted). This history\ndemonstrates not that States “doub[t]” their “constitu-\ntiona[l]” authority to tax residents’ income, wherever\nearned, as the majority speculates, ante, at 18, but that\nthe very political processes the Court disregards as “fanci-\nful,” ante, at 12, have in fact worked to produce policies\nthe Court ranks as responsible—all the more reason to\nresist this Court’s heavy-handed supervision.\n   The Court also attempts to deflect the force of this his-\ntory and precedent by relying on a “trilogy” of decisions it\nfinds “particularly instructive.” Ante, at 6–7 (citing Cen-\ntral Greyhound Lines, Inc. v.

As the majority\nacknowledges, however, those three decisions involved\ngross receipts taxes, not income taxes. Ante, at 7–9. True,\nthis Court has recently pointed to similarities between\nthese two forms of taxation. See ante, at 9.

Ante, at 9.\nFor decades—including the years when the majority’s\n“trilogy” was decided—the Court has routinely maintained\nthat “the difference between taxes on net income and taxes\non gross receipts from interstate commerce warrants\ndifferent results” under the Commerce Clause. C. Trost &\nP. Hartman, Federal Limitations on State and Local Taxa-\ntion 2d §10:1 (2003).\n   In Shaffer, for example, the Court rejected the taxpay-\ner’s dormant Commerce Clause challenge because “the tax\n[was] imposed not upon gross receipts . . . but only upon\nthe net proceeds.” 252 U. S., at 57. Just three years\nbefore deciding J. D. Adams, the Court emphasized “mani-\nfest and substantial” differences between the two types of\ntaxes, calling the burden imposed by a gross receipts tax\n“direct and immediate,” in contrast to the “indirect and\nincidental” burden imposed by an income tax. Stewart\nDry Goods Co. v. Lewis, 294 U. S. 550, 558 (1935) (quoting\nUnited States Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, 247 U. S.\n321, 328 (1918)). And the Gwin, White opinion observed\nthat invalidating the gross receipts tax at issue “left to the\nstates wide scope for taxation of those engaged in inter-\nstate commerce, extending to . . . net income derived from\nit.” 305 U. S., at 441 (emphasis added).\n   The majority asserts that this Court “rejected” this\ndistinction in Moorman Mfg. See ante, at 9. That decision\nin fact described gross receipts taxes as “more burden-\nsome” than income taxes—twice. 437 U. S., at 280, 281.\nIn particular, Moorman upheld a state income tax because\nan earlier decision had upheld a similar but “inherently\nmore burdensome” gross receipts tax. Id., at 281. To say\nthat the constitutionality of an income tax follows\na fortiori from the constitutionality of a similar but “more\nburdensome” gross receipts tax is to affirm, not reject, a\ndistinction between the two.\n14     COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  The Justices participating in the Court’s “trilogy,” in\nshort, would scarcely expect to see the three decisions\ninvoked to invalidate a tax on net income.\n                              II\n   Abandoning principles and precedent sustaining simul-\ntaneous residence- and source-based income taxation, the\nCourt offers two reasons for striking down Maryland’s\ncounty income tax: (1) the tax creates a risk of double\ntaxation, ante, at 7, 18; and (2) the Court deems Mary-\nland’s income tax “scheme” “inherently discriminatory”—\nby which the Court means, the scheme fails the so-called\n“internal consistency” test, ante, at 21–22. The first objec-\ntion is overwhelmed by the history, recounted above, of\nStates imposing and this Court upholding income taxes\nthat carried a similar risk of double taxation. See supra,\nat 6–12. The Court’s reliance on the internal consistency\ntest is no more compelling.\n   This Court has not rigidly required States to maintain\ninternally consistent tax regimes. Before today, for two\ndecades, the Court has not insisted that a tax under re-\nview pass the internal consistency test, see Oklahoma Tax\nComm’n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 185 (1995),\nand has not struck down a state tax for failing the test in\nnearly 30 years, see American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.\nScheiner, 483 U. S. 266, 284–287 (1987) (ATA I); Tyler\nPipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue,\n483 U. S. 232, 247–248 (1987). Moreover, the Court has\nrejected challenges to taxes that flunk the test. The Okla-\nhoma tax “scheme” upheld under the dormant Commerce\nClause in Shaffer, for example, is materially indistin-\nguishable from—therefore as internally inconsistent as—\nMaryland’s scheme. 252 U. S., at 57. And more recently,\nin American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv.\nComm’n, the Court upheld a “concede[dly]” internally\ninconsistent state tax. 545 U.

See ibid.6\n   The logic of ATA II, counsel for the Wynnes appeared to\nrecognize, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 46–47, would permit a State\nto impose a head tax—i.e., a flat charge imposed on every\nresident in the State—even if that tax were part of an\ninternally inconsistent tax scheme. Such a tax would rest\non purely local conduct: the taxpayer’s residence in the\ntaxing State. And the taxes paid would defray costs\nclosely connected to that local conduct—the services used\nby the taxpayer while living in the State.\n   I see no reason why the Constitution requires us to\ndisarm States from using a progressive tax, rather than a\nflat toll, to cover the costs of local services all residents\nenjoy. A head tax and a residence-based income tax differ,\ndo they not, only in that the latter is measured by each\ntaxpayer’s ability to pay. Like the head tax, however, a\nresidence-based income tax is triggered by the purely local\nconduct of residing in the State. And also like the head\ntax, a residence-based income tax covers costs closely\n——————\n  6 The majority reads American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Michigan Pub.\n\nServ. Comm’n, 545 U. S. 429 (2005) (ATA II), in a way so implausible, it\nmust resort to quoting from an amicus brief, rather than from the\nCourt’s opinion. According to the majority, this Court did not think the\nchallenged tax failed the internal consistency test in ATA II, it held\nonly that the challengers had failed to make the necessary “empirical\nshowing.” See ante, at 20–21, n. 7. It is true that the United States\nmade that argument. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nATA II, O. T. 2004, No. 03–1230, p. 26. But one searches the U. S.\nReports in vain for any indication that the Court adopted it. Which is\nhardly surprising, for one would scarcely think that a test turning on\n“hypothetically” assessing a tax’s “structure,” ante, at 19 (emphasis\nadded), would require empirical data. What the Court in fact said in\nATA II, is that the tax’s internal inconsistency would be excused be-\ncause any multiple taxation resulting from every State adopting the\nchallenged tax would be caused by interstate firms’ choosing to “en-\ngag[e] in local business in all those States.” 545 U. S., at 438.\n16      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nconnected to that residence: It finances services used by\nthose living in the State. If a head tax qualifies for ATA\nII’s reprieve from internal consistency, then so too must a\nresidence-based income tax.\n   The majority asserts that because Maryland’s tax\nscheme is internally inconsistent, it “operates as a tariff,”\nmaking it “ ‘patently unconstitutional.’ ” Ante, at 22. This\nis a curious claim. The defining characteristic of a tariff is\nthat it taxes interstate activity at a higher rate than it\ntaxes the same activity conducted within the State. See\nWest Lynn Creamery, 512 U. S., at 193. Maryland’s resi-\ndent income tax does the exact opposite: It taxes the in-\ncome of its residents at precisely the same rate, whether\nthe income is earned in-state or out-of-state.7\n   There is, moreover, a deep flaw in the Court’s chosen\ntest. The Court characterizes internal consistency as a\n“cure,” ante, at 18, 25–26, but the test is scarcely that, at\nleast for the double taxation the Court believes to justify\nits intervention. According to the Court, Maryland’s tax\n“scheme” is internally inconsistent because Maryland\nsimultaneously imposes two taxes: the county income tax\nand the special nonresident tax. See ante, at 7, 21–22, and\nn. 8. But only one of these taxes—the county income tax—\nactually falls on the Wynnes. Because it is the interaction\nbetween these two taxes that renders Maryland’s tax\nscheme internally inconsistent, Maryland could eliminate\nthe inconsistency by terminating the special nonresident\ntax—a measure that would not help the Wynnes at all.8\nMaryland could, in other words, bring itself into compli-\nance with the test at the heart of the Court’s analysis\nwithout removing the double tax burden the test is pur-\n——————\n  7 The majority faults the dissents for not “disput[ing]” its “economic\n\nanalysis,” but beyond citation to a pair of amicus briefs, its opinion\noffers no analysis to dispute.

Ante, at\n21–22, 25. Both States fail the internal consistency test\nbecause they impose (1) a 1.25% tax on income that resi-\ndents earn in-state, (2) a 1.25% tax on income that resi-\ndents earn in other jurisdictions, and (3) a 1.25% tax on\nincome that nonresidents earn in-state. According to the\nCourt, these tax schemes are troubling because “Bob will\npay more income tax than April solely because he earns\nincome interstate.” Ante, at 22.\n  Each State, however, need not pursue the same ap-\nproach to make their tax schemes internally consistent.9\nSee ante, at 25–26. State A might choose to tax residents’\nworldwide income only, which it could do by eliminating\ntax #3 (on nonresidents’ in-state income). State B might\ninstead choose exclusively to tax income earned within the\nState by deleting tax #2 (on residents’ out-of-state income).\nEach State’s tax scheme would then be internally con-\nsistent. But the tax burden on April and Bob would re-\nmain unchanged: Just as under the original schemes,\nApril would have to pay a 1.25% tax only once, to State A,\nand Bob would have to pay a 1.25% tax twice: once to\nState A, where he resides, and once to State B, where he\nearns the income. The Court’s “cure,” in other words, is no\nmatch for the perceived disease.10\n——————\n  9 I do not “clai[m]” as the Court groundlessly suggests, that the\n\nCourt’s analysis “establish[es] . . . [a] rule of priority” between resi-\ndence- and source-based taxation. Ante, at 25–26. My objection,\nrather, is that the Court treats source-based authority as “box[ing] in” a\nState’s discrete authority to tax on the basis of residence. Supra, at 1.\nThere is no “inconsisten[cy]” in my analysis, and the majority plainly\nerrs in insisting that there is. Ante, at 25.\n  10 Attempting to preserve the test’s qualification as a “cure,” the\n\nCourt redefines the illness as not just double taxation but double\ntaxation caused by an “inherently discriminat[ory]” tax “scheme.” Ante,\n18      COMPTROLLER OF TREASURY OF MD. v. WYNNE\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court asserts that this flaw is just a “truism” of\nevery discrimination case, whether brought under the\ndormant Commerce Clause or the Equal Protection\nClause. Ante, at 26. That is simply incorrect. As the\nCourt acknowledges, a government that impermissibly\n“treats like cases differently” (i.e., discriminates) can\nordinarily cure the violation either by “leveling up” or\n“leveling down.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nConsider another April and Bob example. If Bob must pay\na 10% tax and April must pay a 5% tax, that discrimina-\ntion can be eliminated either by requiring both to pay the\n10% tax (“leveling up”) or by requiring both to pay the 5%\ntax (“leveling down”). True, “leveling up” leaves Bob’s tax\nbill unchanged. “Leveling up” nonetheless benefits Bob\nbecause it eliminates the unfairness of being treated\ndifferently. And if, as is often true in dormant Commerce\nClause cases, April and Bob compete in the same market,\nthen “leveling up” provides the concrete benefit of placing\na new burden on Bob’s competitors.\n   The majority’s rule does not work this way. As just\nexplained, Maryland can “cure” what the majority deems\ndiscrimination without lowering the Wynnes’ taxes or\nincreasing the tax burden on any of the Wynnes’ neigh-\nbors—by terminating the special nonresident tax. See\nsupra, at 16–17. The State can, in other words, satisfy the\nmajority not by lowering Bob’s taxes or by raising April’s\ntaxes, but by eliminating the taxes imposed on yet a third\n\n——————\nat 19–20. Relying on such a distinction to justify the test is entirely\ncircular, however, as the Court defines “inherent discrimination” in this\ncase as internal inconsistency. In any event, given the concern that\npurportedly drives the Court’s analysis, it is mystifying why the Court\nsees “virtue” in striking down only one of the two schemes under which\nBob is taxed twice. Ante, at 19. Whatever disincentive the original\nscheme creates for Bob (or the Wynnes) to work in interstate commerce\nis created just as much by the revised scheme that the Court finds\nsatisfactory.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

The Court’s internal consis-\ntency test thus scarcely resembles “ordinary” anti-\ndiscrimination law. Whatever virtue the internal con-\nsistency test has in other contexts, this shortcoming\nmakes it a poor excuse for jettisoning taxation principles\nas entrenched as those here.\n                        *    *     *\n   This case is, at bottom, about policy choices: Should\nStates prioritize ensuring that all who live or work within\nthe State shoulder their fair share of the costs of govern-\nment?
