SHARIF\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 13–935.      Argued January 14, 2015—Decided May 26, 2015\nRespondent Richard Sharif tried to discharge a debt he owed petition-\n  ers, Wellness International Network, Ltd., and its owners (collective-\n  ly Wellness), in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Wellness sought, inter\n  alia, a declaratory judgment from the Bankruptcy Court, contending\n  that a trust Sharif claimed to administer was in fact Sharif’s alter-\n  ego, and that its assets were his personal property and part of his\n  bankruptcy estate. The Bankruptcy Court eventually entered a de-\n  fault judgment against Sharif. While Sharif’s appeal was pending in\n  District Court, but before briefing concluded, this Court held that Ar-\n  ticle III forbids bankruptcy courts to enter a final judgment on claims\n  that seek only to “augment” the bankruptcy estate and would other-\n  wise “exis[t] without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.” Stern v.\n  Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, ___. After briefing closed, Sharif sought\n  permission to file a supplemental brief raising a Stern objection. The\n  District Court denied the motion, finding it untimely, and affirmed\n  the Bankruptcy Court’s judgment. As relevant here, the Seventh\n  Circuit determined that Sharif’s Stern objection could not be waived\n  because it implicated structural interests and reversed on the alter-\n  ego claim, holding that the Bankruptcy Court lacked constitutional\n  authority to enter final judgment on that claim.\nHeld:\n    1. Article III permits bankruptcy judges to adjudicate Stern claims\n with the parties’ knowing and voluntary consent. Pp. 8–17.\n       (a) The foundational case supporting the adjudication of legal\n disputes by non-Article III judges with the consent of the parties is\n Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833. There,\n the Court held that the right to adjudication before an Article III\n2            WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    court is “personal” and therefore “subject to waiver.” Id., at 848. The\n    Court also recognized that if Article III’s structural interests as “ ‘an\n    inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and bal-\n    ances’ ” are implicated, “the parties cannot by consent cure the consti-\n    tutional difficulty.” Id., at 850–851. The importance of consent was\n    reiterated in two later cases involving the Federal Magistrates Act’s\n    assignment of non-Article III magistrate judges to supervise voir dire\n    in felony trials. In Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858, the Court\n    held that a magistrate judge was not permitted to select a jury with-\n    out the defendant’s consent, id., at 864. But in Peretz v. United\n    States, 501 U. S. 923, the Court stated that “the defendant’s consent\n    significantly changes the constitutional analysis,” id., at 932. Be-\n    cause an Article III court retained supervisory authority over the\n    process, the Court found “no structural protections . . . implicated”\n    and upheld the Magistrate Judge’s action. Id., at 937. Pp. 8–12.\n         (b) The question whether allowing bankruptcy courts to decide\n    Stern claims by consent would “impermissibly threate[n] the institu-\n    tional integrity of the Judicial Branch,” Schor, 478 U. S., at 851, must\n    be decided “with an eye to the practical effect that the” practice “will\n    have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary,”\n    ibid. For several reasons, this practice does not usurp the constitu-\n    tional prerogatives of Article III courts. Bankruptcy judges are ap-\n    pointed and may be removed by Article III judges, see 28 U. S. C.\n    §§152(a)(1), (e); “serve as judicial officers of the United States district\n    court,” §151; and collectively “constitute a unit of the district court”\n    for the district in which they serve, §152(a)(1). Bankruptcy courts\n    hear matters solely on a district court’s reference, §157(a), and pos-\n    sess no free-floating authority to decide claims traditionally heard by\n    Article III courts, see Schor, 478 U. S., at 854, 856. “[T]he decision to\n    invoke” the bankruptcy court’s authority “is left entirely to the par-\n    ties,” id., at 855, and “the power of the federal judiciary to take juris-\n    diction” remains in place, ibid. Finally, there is no indication that\n    Congress gave bankruptcy courts the ability to decide Stern claims in\n    an effort to aggrandize itself or humble the Judiciary. See, e.g.,\n    Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937. Pp. 12–15.\n         (c) Stern does not compel a different result. It turned on the fact\n    that the litigant “did not truly consent to” resolution of the claim\n    against it in a non-Article III forum, 564 U. S., at ___, and thus, does\n    not govern the question whether litigants may validly consent to ad-\n    judication by a bankruptcy court. Moreover, expanding Stern to hold\n    that a litigant may not waive the right to an Article III court through\n    consent would be inconsistent with that opinion’s own description of\n    its holding as “a ‘narrow’ one” that did “not change all that much”\n    about the division of labor between district and bankruptcy courts.\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  Id., at ___. Pp. 15–17.\n     2. Consent to adjudication by a bankruptcy court need not be ex-\n  press, but must be knowing and voluntary. Neither the Constitution\n  nor the relevant statute—which requires “the consent of all parties to\n  the proceeding” to hear a Stern claim, §157(c)(2)—mandates express\n  consent. Such a requirement would be in great tension with this\n  Court’s holding that substantially similar language in §636(c)—which\n  authorizes magistrate judges to conduct proceedings “[u]pon consent\n  of the parties”—permits waiver based on “actions rather than words,”\n  Roell v. Withrow, 538 U. S. 580, 589. Roell’s implied consent stand-\n  ard supplies the appropriate rule for bankruptcy court adjudications\n  and makes clear that a litigant’s consent—whether express or im-\n  plied—must be knowing and voluntary. Pp. 18–19.\n     3. The Seventh Circuit should decide on remand whether Sharif’s\n  actions evinced the requisite knowing and voluntary consent and\n  whether Sharif forfeited his Stern argument below.

Because these protections help to ensure\nthe integrity and independence of the Judiciary, “we have\nlong recognized that, in general, Congress may not with-\ndraw from” the Article III courts “any matter which, from\nits nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in\nequity, or in admiralty.” Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 18) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Congress has also authorized the appointment of bank-\nruptcy and magistrate judges, who do not enjoy the protec-\ntions of Article III, to assist Article III courts in their\nwork. The number of magistrate and bankruptcy judge-\nships exceeds the number of circuit and district judge-\n2          WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v.

In Northern Pipe-\nline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50\n(1982) (plurality opinion), and more recently in Stern, this\nCourt held that Congress violated Article III by authoriz-\ning bankruptcy judges to decide certain claims for which\nlitigants are constitutionally entitled to an Article III\nadjudication. This case presents the question whether\nArticle III allows bankruptcy judges to adjudicate such\nclaims with the parties’ consent. We hold that Article III\nis not violated when the parties knowingly and voluntarily\nconsent to adjudication by a bankruptcy judge.\n                            I\n                            A\n  Before 1978, district courts typically delegated bank-\nruptcy proceedings to “referees.” Executive Benefits Ins.\n——————\n   1 Congress has authorized 179 circuit judgeships and 677 district\n\njudgeships, a total of 856.

S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4).\nUnder the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, bankruptcy referees\nhad “[s]ummary jurisdiction” over “claims involving ‘prop-\nerty in the actual or constructive possession of the bank-\nruptcy court’ ”—that is, over the apportionment of the\nbankruptcy estate among creditors.           Ibid. (alteration\nomitted). They could preside over other proceedings—\nmatters implicating the court’s “plenary jurisdiction”—by\nconsent. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5); see also MacDonald v.\nPlymouth County Trust Co., 286 U. S. 263, 266–267\n(1932).\n   In 1978, Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Reform Act,\nwhich repealed the 1898 Act and gave the newly created\nbankruptcy courts power “much broader than that exer-\ncised under the former referee system.” Northern Pipe-\nline, 458 U. S., at 54. The Act “[e]liminat[ed] the distinc-\ntion between ‘summary’ and ‘plenary’ jurisdiction” and\nenabled bankruptcy courts to decide “all ‘civil proceedings\narising under title 11 [the Bankruptcy title] or arising\nin or related to cases under title 11.’ ” Ibid. (emphasis de-\nleted). Congress thus vested bankruptcy judges with most\nof the “‘powers of a court of equity, law, and admiralty,’” id.,\nat 55, without affording them the benefits of Article III.\nThis Court therefore held parts of the system unconstitu-\ntional in Northern Pipeline.\n   Congress responded by enacting the Bankruptcy\nAmendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984. Under\nthat Act, district courts have original jurisdiction over\nbankruptcy cases and related proceedings. 28 U. S. C.\n§§1334(a), (b). But “[e]ach district court may provide that\nany or all” bankruptcy cases and related proceedings\n“shall be referred to the bankruptcy judges for the dis-\ntrict.” §157(a). Bankruptcy judges are “judicial officers of\nthe United States district court,” appointed to 14-year\nterms by the courts of appeals, and subject to removal for\ncause. §§152(a)(1), (e). “The district court may withdraw”\n4          WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v.

But it\ngave bankruptcy courts more limited author-ity in non-\ncore proceedings: They may “hear and determine” such\nproceedings, and “enter appropriate orders and judg-\nments,” only “with the consent of all the parties to the\nproceeding.” §157(c)(2). Absent consent, bankruptcy\ncourts in non-core proceedings may only “submit proposed\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law,” which the district\ncourts review de novo. §157(c)(1).\n                            B\n  Petitioner Wellness International Network is a manu-\nfacturer of health and nutrition products.4 Wellness and\nrespondent Sharif entered into a contract under which\nSharif would distribute Wellness’ products.

Sharif repeatedly ignored Wellness’ discovery\nrequests and other litigation obligations, resulting in an\nentry of default judgment for Wellness. The District Court\neventually sanctioned Sharif by awarding Wellness over\n$650,000 in attorney’s fees. This case arises from Well-\nness’ long-running—and so far unsuccessful—efforts to\ncollect on that judgment.\n   In February 2009, Sharif filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nin the Northern District of Illinois. The bankruptcy peti-\ntion listed Wellness as a creditor. Wellness requested\ndocuments concerning Sharif ’s assets, which Sharif did\nnot provide. Wellness later obtained a loan application\nSharif had filed in 2002, listing more than $5 million in\nassets. When confronted, Sharif informed Wellness and\nthe Chapter 7 trustee that he had lied on the loan applica-\ntion. The listed assets, Sharif claimed, were actually\nowned by the Soad Wattar Living Trust (Trust), an entity\nSharif said he administered on behalf of his mother, and\nfor the benefit of his sister. Wellness pressed Sharif\nfor information on the Trust, but Sharif again failed to\nrespond.\n   Wellness filed a five-count adversary complaint against\nSharif in the Bankruptcy Court. See App. 5–22. Counts\nI–IV of the complaint objected to the discharge of Sharif ’s\ndebts because, among other reasons, Sharif had concealed\nproperty by claiming that it was owned by the Trust.\nCount V of the complaint sought a declaratory judgment\nthat the Trust was Sharif ’s alter ego and that its assets\nshould therefore be treated as part of Sharif ’s bankruptcy\nestate. Id., at 21. In his answer, Sharif admitted that the\nadversary proceeding was a “core proceeding” under 28\nU. S. C. §157(b)—i.e., a proceeding in which the Bankruptcy\nCourt could enter final judgment subject to appeal. See\n§§157(b)(1), (2)(J); App. 24. Indeed, Sharif requested\njudgment in his favor on all counts of Wellness’ complaint\n6        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand urged the Bankruptcy Court to “find that the Soad\nWattar Living Trust is not property of the [bankruptcy]\nestate.” Id., at 44.\n   A familiar pattern of discovery evasion ensued. Well-\nness responded by filing a motion for sanctions, or, in the\nalternative, to compel discovery. Granting the motion to\ncompel, the Bankruptcy Court warned Sharif that if he did\nnot respond to Wellness’ discovery requests a default\njudgment would be entered against him. Sharif eventu-\nally complied with some discovery obligations, but did not\nproduce any documents related to the Trust.\n   In July 2010, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling\nfinding that Sharif had violated the court’s discovery\norder. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 92a–120a. It accordingly\ndenied Sharif ’s request to discharge his debts and entered\na default judgment against him in the adversary proceed-\ning. And it declared, as requested by count V of Wellness’\ncomplaint, that the assets supposedly held by the Trust\nwere in fact property of Sharif ’s bankruptcy estate be-\ncause Sharif “treats [the Trust’s] assets as his own prop-\nerty.” Id., at 119a.\n   Sharif appealed to the District Court. Six weeks before\nSharif filed his opening brief in the District Court, this\nCourt decided Stern. In Stern, the Court held that Article\nIII prevents bankruptcy courts from entering final judg-\nment on claims that seek only to “augment” the bankruptcy\nestate and would otherwise “exis[t] without regard to\nany bankruptcy proceeding.” 564 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip\nop., at 27, 34). Sharif did not cite Stern in his opening\nbrief. Rather, after the close of briefing, Sharif moved for\nleave to file a supplemental brief, arguing that in light of\nIn re Ortiz, 665 F. 3d 906 (CA7 2011)—a recently issued\ndecision interpreting Stern—“the bankruptcy court’s order\nshould only be treated as a report and recommendation.”\nApp. 145.

The\nSeventh Circuit acknowledged that ordinarily Sharif ’s\nStern objection would “not [be] preserved because he\nwaited too long to assert it.” 727 F. 3d, at 767.5 But the\ncourt determined that the ordinary rule did not apply\nbecause Sharif ’s argument concerned “the allocation of\nauthority between bankruptcy courts and district courts”\nunder Article III, and thus “implicate[d] structural inter-\nests.” Id., at 771. Based on those separation-of-powers\nconsiderations, the court held that “a litigant may not\nwaive” a Stern objection. Id., at 773. Turning to the\nmerits of Sharif ’s contentions, the Seventh Circuit agreed\nwith the Bankruptcy Court’s resolution of counts I–IV of\nWellness’ adversary complaint. It further concluded,\nhowever, that count V of the complaint alleged a so-called\n“Stern claim,” that is, “a claim designated for final adjudi-\ncation in the bankruptcy court as a statutory matter, but\nprohibited from proceeding in that way as a constitutional\nmatter.” Executive Benefits, 573 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n4). The Seventh Circuit therefore ruled that the Bank-\nruptcy Court lacked constitutional authority to enter final\njudgment on count V.6\n——————\n   5 Although the Seventh Circuit referred to Sharif’s failure to raise his\n\nStern argument in a timely manner as a waiver, that court has since\nclarified that its decision rested on forfeiture. See Peterson v. Somers\nDublin Ltd., 729 F. 3d 741, 747 (2013) (“The issue in Wellness Interna-\ntional Network was forfeiture rather than waiver”).\n   6 The Seventh Circuit concluded its opinion by considering the rem-\n\nedy for the Bankruptcy Court’s purportedly unconstitutional issuance\nof a final judgment. The court determined that if count V of Wellness’\ncomplaint raised a core claim, the only statutorily authorized remedy\nwould be for the District Court to withdraw the reference to the Bank-\nruptcy Court and set a new discovery schedule. The Seventh Circuit’s\nreasoning on this point was rejected by our decision last Term in\nExecutive Benefits, which held that district courts may treat Stern\n8         WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v.

S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),\nwhich Congress had authorized to hear customer com-\nplaints against commodities brokers, issued a regulation\nallowing itself to hear state-law counterclaims as well.\nWilliam Schor filed a complaint with the CFTC against his\nbroker, and the broker, which had previously filed claims\nagainst Schor in federal court, refiled them as counter-\nclaims in the CFTC proceeding. The CFTC ruled against\nSchor on the counterclaims. This Court upheld that ruling\nagainst both statutory and constitutional challenges.\n  On the constitutional question (the one relevant here)\nthe Court began by holding that Schor had “waived any\nright he may have possessed to the full trial of [the bro-\nker’s] counterclaim before an Article III court.” Id., at 849.\nThe Court then explained why this waiver legitimated the\nCFTC’s exercise of authority: “[A]s a personal right, Arti-\ncle III’s guarantee of an impartial and independent federal\nadjudication is subject to waiver, just as are other per-\nsonal constitutional rights”—such as the right to a jury—\n“that dictate the procedures by which civil and criminal\nmatters must be tried.” Id., at 848–849.\n  The Court went on to state that a litigant’s waiver of his\n“personal right” to an Article III court is not always dis-\npositive because Article III “not only preserves to litigants\ntheir interest in an impartial and independent federal\nadjudication of claims . . . , but also serves as ‘an insepa-\nrable element of the constitutional system of checks and\nbalances.’ . . . To the extent that this structural principle\nis implicated in a given case”—but only to that extent—\n“the parties cannot by consent cure the constitutional\ndifficulty . . . .” Id., at 850–851.\n  Leaning heavily on the importance of Schor’s consent,\nthe Court found no structural concern implicated by the\nCFTC’s adjudication of the counterclaims against him.\nWhile “Congress gave the CFTC the authority to adjudi-\ncate such matters,” the Court wrote,\n10         WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n     “the decision to invoke this forum is left entirely to the\n     parties and the power of the federal judiciary to take\n     jurisdiction of these matters is unaffected. In such\n     circumstances, separation of powers concerns are di-\n     minished, for it seems self-evident that just as Con-\n     gress may encourage parties to settle a dispute out of\n     court or resort to arbitration without impermissible\n     incursions on the separation of powers, Congress may\n     make available a quasi-judicial mechanism through\n     which willing parties may, at their option, elect to re-\n     solve their differences.” Id., at 855.\nThe option for parties to submit their disputes to a non-\nArticle III adjudicator was at most a “de minimis” in-\nfringement on the prerogative of the federal courts. Id., at\n856.\n   A few years after Schor, the Court decided a pair of\ncases—Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858 (1989), and\nPeretz v. United States, 501 U. S. 923 (1991)—that reiter-\nated the importance of consent to the constitutional analy-\nsis. Both cases concerned whether the Federal Magis-\ntrates Act authorized magistrate judges to preside over\njury selection in a felony trial;8 the difference was that\nPeretz consented to the practice while Gomez did not.\nThat difference was dispositive.\n   In Gomez, the Court interpreted the statute as not\nallowing magistrate judges to supervise voir dire without\nconsent, emphasizing the constitutional concerns that\nmight otherwise arise. See 490 U. S., at 864. In Peretz,\nthe Court upheld the Magistrate Judge’s action, stating\nthat “the defendant’s consent significantly changes the\nconstitutional analysis.” 501 U. S., at 932. The Court\n——————\n  8 Inrelevant part, the Act provides that district courts may assign\nmagistrate judges certain enumerated duties as well as “such additional\nduties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and the laws of\nthe United States.” 28 U.

S., at 848), and that “[t]he\nmost basic rights of criminal defendants are similarly\nsubject to waiver,” 501 U. S., at 936. And “[e]ven assum-\ning that a litigant may not waive structural protections\nprovided by Article III,” the Court found “no such struc-\ntural protections . . . implicated by” a magistrate judge’s\nsupervision of voir dire:\n     “Magistrates are appointed and subject to removal by\n     Article III judges. The ‘ultimate decision’ whether to\n     invoke the magistrate’s assistance is made by the dis-\n     trict court, subject to veto by the parties. The decision\n     whether to empanel the jury whose selection a magis-\n     trate has supervised also remains entirely with the\n     district court. Because ‘the entire process takes place\n     under the district court’s total control and jurisdic-\n     tion,’ there is no danger that use of the magistrate in-\n     volves a ‘congressional attemp[t] “to transfer jurisdic-\n     tion [to non-Article III tribunals] for the purpose of\n     emasculating” constitutional courts.’ ” Id., at 937 (ci-\n     tations omitted; alteration in original).9\n  The lesson of Schor, Peretz, and the history that preced-\ned them is plain: The entitlement to an Article III adjudi-\ncator is “a personal right” and thus ordinarily “subject to\n——————\n  9 Discounting the relevance of Gomez and Peretz, the principal dissent\n\nemphasizes that neither case concerned the entry of final judgment by\na non-Article III actor. See post, at 16 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). Here\nagain, the principal dissent’s insistence on formalism leads it astray.\nAs we explained in Peretz, the “responsibility and importance [of]\npresiding over voir dire at a felony trial” is equivalent to the “supervi-\nsion of entire civil and misdemeanor trials,” 501 U. S., at 933, tasks in\nwhich magistrate judges may “order the entry of judgment” with the\nparties’ consent, §636(c)(1).\n12        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwaiver,” Schor, 478 U. S., at 848. Article III also serves a\nstructural purpose, “barring congressional attempts ‘to\ntransfer jurisdiction [to non-Article III tribunals] for the\npurpose of emasculating’ constitutional courts and thereby\nprevent[ing] ‘the encroachment or aggrandizement of one\nbranch at the expense of the other.’ ” Id., at 850 (citations\nomitted). But allowing Article I adjudicators to decide\nclaims submitted to them by consent does not offend the\nseparation of powers so long as Article III courts retain\nsupervisory authority over the process.\n                              B\n   The question here, then, is whether allowing bankruptcy\ncourts to decide Stern claims by consent would “imper-\nmissibly threate[n] the institutional integrity of the Judi-\ncial Branch.” Schor, 478 U. S., at 851. And that question\nmust be decided not by “formalistic and unbending rules,”\nbut “with an eye to the practical effect that the” practice\n“will have on the constitutionally assigned role of the\nfederal judiciary.” Ibid.; see Thomas v. Union Carbide\nAgricultural Products Co., 473 U. S. 568, 587 (1985)\n(“[P]ractical attention to substance rather than doctrinaire\nreliance on formal categories should inform application of\nArticle III”). The Court must weigh\n     “the extent to which the essential attributes of judicial\n     power are reserved to Article III courts, and, con-\n     versely, the extent to which the non-Article III forum exer-\n     cises the range of jurisdiction and powers normally\n     vested only in Article III courts, the origins and im-\n     portance of the right to be adjudicated, and the con-\n     cerns that drove Congress to depart from the re-\n     quirements of Article III.” Schor, 478 U.

S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of Stern claims does not usurp the constitutional\nprerogatives of Article III courts. Bankruptcy judges, like\nmagistrate judges, “are appointed and subject to removal\nby Article III judges,” Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937; see 28\nU. S. C. §§152(a)(1), (e). They “serve as judicial officers of\nthe United States district court,” §151, and collectively\n“constitute a unit of the district court” for that district,\n§152(a)(1). Just as “[t]he ‘ultimate decision’ whether to\ninvoke [a] magistrate [judge]’s assistance is made by the\ndistrict court,” Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937, bankruptcy courts\nhear matters solely on a district court’s reference, §157(a),\nwhich the district court may withdraw sua sponte or at the\nrequest of a party, §157(d). “[S]eparation of powers con-\ncerns are diminished” when, as here, “the decision to\ninvoke [a non-Article III] forum is left entirely to the\nparties and the power of the federal judiciary to take\njurisdiction” remains in place. Schor, 478 U. S., at 855.\n   Furthermore, like the CFTC in Schor, bankruptcy\ncourts possess no free-floating authority to decide claims\ntraditionally heard by Article III courts. Their ability to\nresolve such matters is limited to “a narrow class of com-\nmon law claims as an incident to the [bankruptcy courts’]\nprimary, and unchallenged, adjudicative function.” Id., at\n854. “In such circumstances, the magnitude of any intru-\nsion on the Judicial Branch can only be termed de mini-\nmis.” Id., at 856.\n   Finally, there is no indication that Congress gave bank-\nruptcy courts the ability to decide Stern claims in an effort\nto aggrandize itself or humble the Judiciary. As in Peretz,\n“[b]ecause ‘the entire process takes place under the district\ncourt’s total control and jurisdiction,’ there is no danger\nthat use of the [bankruptcy court] involves a ‘congres-\nsional attemp[t] “to transfer jurisdiction [to non-Article III\ntribunals] for the purpose of emasculating” constitutional\ncourts.’ ” 501 U.

Post, at 16. That argument misapprehends\nboth Schor and the nature of our analysis. What Schor forbids is using\nconsent to excuse an actual violation of Article III. See 478 U. S., at\n850–851 (“To the extent that th[e] structural principle [protected by\nArticle III] is implicated in a given case, the parties cannot by consent\ncure the constitutional difficulty . . .” (emphasis added)). But Schor\nconfirms that consent remains highly relevant when determining, as we\ndo here, whether a particular adjudication in fact raises constitutional\nconcerns. See id., at 855 (“separation of powers concerns are dimin-\nished” when “the decision to invoke [a non-Article III] forum is left\nentirely to the parties”). Thus, we do not rely on Sharif’s consent to\n“cur[e]” a violation of Article III. His consent shows, in part, why no\nsuch violation has occurred. Cf. Meltzer, Legislative Courts, Legisla-\ntive Power, and the Constitution, 65 Ind. L. J. 291, 303 (1990)\n(“[C]onsent provides, if not complete, at least very considerable reason\nto doubt that the tribunal poses a serious threat to the ideal of federal\nadjudicatory independence”); Fallon, Of Legislative Courts, Adminis-\ntrative Agencies, and Article III, 101 Harv.

That is because Stern—like its predecessor, North-\nern Pipeline—turned on the fact that the litigant “did not\ntruly consent to” resolution of the claim against it in a\nnon-Article III forum. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 27).\n   To understand Stern, it is necessary to first understand\nNorthern Pipeline. There, the Court considered whether\nbankruptcy judges “could ‘constitutionally be vested with\njurisdiction to decide [a] state-law contract claim’ against\nan entity that was not otherwise part of the bankruptcy\nproceedings.” 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). In answer-\ning that question in the negative, both the plurality and\nthen-Justice Rehnquist, concurring in the judgment, noted\nthat the entity in question did not consent to the bank-\nruptcy court’s adjudication of the claim. See 458 U. S., at\n80, n. 31 (plurality opinion); id., at 91 (opinion of\nRehnquist, J.). The Court confirmed in two later cases\nthat Northern Pipeline turned on the lack of consent. See\nSchor, 478 U. S., at 849 (“[I]n Northern Pipeline, . . . the\nabsence of consent to an initial adjudication before a non-\nArticle III tribunal was relied on as a significant factor in\ndetermining that Article III forbade such adjudication”);\nThomas, 473 U. S., at 584.\n   Stern presented the same scenario. The majority cited\nthe dissent’s observation that Northern Pipeline “estab-\nlish[ed] only that Congress may not vest in a non-Article\nIII court the power to adjudicate, render final judgment,\nand issue binding orders in a traditional contract action\narising under state law, without consent of the litigants,\nand subject only to ordinary appellate review,” 564 U. S.,\n16         WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nat ___ (slip op., at 28–29) (emphasis added; internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). To which the majority responded,\n“Just so: Substitute ‘tort’ for ‘contract,’ and that statement\ndirectly covers this case.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 29); see\nalso id., at ___ (slip op., at 27) (defendant litigated in the\nBankruptcy Court because he “had nowhere else to go” to\npursue his claim). Because Stern was premised on non-\nconsent to adjudication by the Bankruptcy Court, the\n“constitutional bar” it announced, see post, at 14\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), simply does not govern the\nquestion whether litigants may validly consent to adjudi-\ncation by a bankruptcy court.\n   An expansive reading of Stern, moreover, would be\ninconsistent with the opinion’s own description of its\nholding. The Court in Stern took pains to note that the\nquestion before it was “a ‘narrow’ one,” and that its answer\ndid “not change all that much” about the division of labor\nbetween district courts and bankruptcy courts. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 37); see also id., at ___ (slip op., at 38) (stating\nthat Congress had exceeded the limitations of Article III\n“in one isolated respect”). That could not have been a fair\ncharacterization of the decision if it meant that bank-\nruptcy judges could no longer exercise their longstanding\nauthority to resolve claims submitted to them by consent.\nInterpreting Stern to bar consensual adjudications by\nbankruptcy courts would “meaningfully chang[e] the\ndivision of labor” in our judicial system, contra, id., at ___\n(slip op., at 37).11\n——————\n  11 Inadvancing its restrictive view of Stern, the principal dissent\nignores the sweeping jurisprudential implications of its position. If, as\nthe principal dissent suggests, consent is irrelevant to the Article III\nanalysis, it is difficult to see how Schor and Peretz were not wrongly\ndecided. But those decisions obviously remain good law. It is the\nprincipal dissent’s position that breaks with our precedents. See Plaut\nv. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.

Applied in the bankruptcy context,\nthat standard possesses the same pragmatic virtues—\nincreasing judicial efficiency and checking gamesman-\nship—that motivated our adoption of it for consent-based\nadjudications by magistrate judges. See id., at 590. It\nbears emphasizing, however, that a litigant’s consent—\nwhether express or implied—must still be knowing and\nvoluntary. Roell makes clear that the key inquiry is\nwhether “the litigant or counsel was made aware of the\nneed for consent and the right to refuse it, and still volun-\ntarily appeared to try the case” before the non-Article III\nadjudicator.

The Court faithfully applies Commodity\nFutures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986).\nNo one believes that an arbitrator exercises “[t]he judicial\nPower of the United States,” Art.

Provided\nthat no third party asserted a substantial adverse claim to\nthose assets, the Bankruptcy Court’s adjudication “stems\nfrom the bankruptcy itself ” rather than from “the stuff of\nthe traditional actions at common law tried by the courts\nat Westminster in 1789.” Stern v.

Article III poses no barrier to such a decision.\nThat is enough to resolve this case.\n   Unfortunately, the Court brushes aside this narrow\nbasis for decision and proceeds to the serious constitutional\nquestion whether private parties may consent to an Arti­\ncle III violation. In my view, they cannot. By reserving\nthe judicial power to judges with life tenure and salary\nprotection, Article III constitutes “an inseparable element\nof the constitutional system of checks and balances”—a\nstructural safeguard that must “be jealously guarded.”\nNorthern Pipeline Constr.

S. 833, 850–851 (1986), the majority authorizes\nlitigants to do just that. The Court justifies its decision\nlargely on pragmatic grounds. I would not yield so fully to\nfunctionalism. The Framers adopted the formal protec­\ntions of Article III for good reasons, and “the fact that a\ngiven law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful\nin facilitating functions of government, standing alone,\nwill not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.” INS v.\nChadha, 462 U. S. 919, 944 (1983).\n   The impact of today’s decision may seem limited, but the\nCourt’s acceptance of an Article III violation is not likely\nto go unnoticed. The next time Congress takes judicial\npower from Article III courts, the encroachment may not\nbe so modest—and we will no longer hold the high ground\nof principle. The majority’s acquiescence in the erosion of\nour constitutional power sets a precedent that I fear we\nwill regret. I respectfully dissent.\n                             I\n   The Court granted certiorari on two questions in this\ncase. The first is whether the Bankruptcy Court’s entry of\nfinal judgment on Wellness’s claim violated Article III\nbased on Stern. The second is whether an Article III\nviolation of the kind recognized in Stern can be cured by\nconsent. Because the first question can be resolved on\nnarrower grounds, I would answer it alone.\n                            A\n  The Framers of the Constitution “lived among the ruins\nof a system of intermingled legislative and judicial pow­\ners.” Plaut v.

Between the Revolution\nand the Constitutional Convention, state legislatures\nroutinely interfered with judgments of the courts. This\nhistory created the “sense of a sharp necessity to separate\nthe legislative from the judicial power.” Plaut, 514 U. S.,\nat 221; see Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U. S. ___,\n___–___ (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip\nop., at 5–8). The result was Article III, which established\na judiciary “truly distinct from both the legislature and\nthe executive.” The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter\ned. 1961) (A. Hamilton).\n   Article III vests the “judicial Power of the United\nStates” in “one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts\nas the Congress may from time to time ordain and estab­\nlish.” Art. III, §1. The judges of those courts are entitled\nto hold their offices “during good Behaviour” and to receive\ncompensation “which shall not be diminished” during their\ntenure. Ibid. The judicial power extends “to all Cases, in\nLaw and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws\nof the United States, and Treaties” and to other enumer­\nated matters. Art. III, §2. Taken together, these provi­\nsions define the constitutional birthright of Article III\njudges: to “render dispositive judgments” in cases or con­\ntroversies within the bounds of federal jurisdiction. Plaut,\n514 U. S., at 219 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   With narrow exceptions, Congress may not confer power\nto decide federal cases and controversies upon judges who\ndo not comply with the structural safeguards of Article III.\nThose narrow exceptions permit Congress to establish\nnon-Article III courts to exercise general jurisdiction in\nthe territories and the District of Columbia, to serve as\nmilitary tribunals, and to adjudicate disputes over “public\nrights” such as veterans’ benefits. Northern Pipeline, 458\nU. S., at 64–70 (plurality opinion).\n   Our precedents have also recognized an exception to the\n4        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nrequirements of Article III for certain bankruptcy proceed­\nings. When the Framers gathered to draft the Constitu­\ntion, English statutes had long empowered nonjudicial\nbankruptcy “commissioners” to collect a debtor’s property,\nresolve claims by creditors, order the distribution of assets\nin the estate, and ultimately discharge the debts. See 2\nW. Blackstone, Commentaries *471–488. This historical\npractice, combined with Congress’s constitutional author-\nity to enact bankruptcy laws, confirms that Congress may\nassign to non-Article III courts adjudications involving\n“the restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is at\nthe core of the federal bankruptcy power.” Northern Pipe-\nline, 458 U. S., at 71 (plurality opinion).\n   Although Congress may assign some bankruptcy pro­\nceedings to non-Article III courts, there are limits on that\npower. In Northern Pipeline, the Court invalidated statu­\ntory provisions that permitted a bankruptcy court to enter\nfinal judgment on a creditor’s state law claim for breach of\ncontract. Because that claim arose not from the bankruptcy\nbut from independent common law sources, a majority\nof the Court determined that Article III required an adju­\ndicator with life tenure and salary protection. See id., at\n84; id., at 90–91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).\n   Congress responded to Northern Pipeline by allowing\nbankruptcy courts to render final judgments only in “core”\nbankruptcy proceedings. 28 U. S. C. §157(b). Those\njudgments may be appealed to district courts and re­\nviewed under deferential standards. §158(a). In non-core\nproceedings, bankruptcy judges may submit proposed\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, which the district\ncourt must review de novo before entering final judgment.\n§157(c)(1).\n   In Stern, we faced the question whether a bankruptcy\ncourt could enter final judgment on an action defined by\nCongress as a “core” proceeding—an estate’s counterclaim\nagainst a creditor based on state tort law. §157(b)(2)(C).\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nWe said no. Because the tort claim neither “stem[med]\nfrom the bankruptcy itself ” nor would “necessarily be\nresolved in the claims allowance process,” it fell outside\nthe recognized exceptions to Article III. 564 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 34). Like the contract claim in Northern Pipe-\nline, the tort claim in Stern involved “the stuff of the tradi­\ntional actions at common law tried by the courts at West­\nminster in 1789.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (quoting\nNorthern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 90 (Rehnquist, J., concur­\nring in judgment)). Congress had no power under the\nConstitution to assign the resolution of such a claim to a\njudge who lacked the structural protections of Article III.\n                              B\n  The question here is whether the claim Wellness sub­\nmitted to the Bankruptcy Court is a “Stern claim” that\nrequires final adjudication by an Article III court. See\nExecutive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison, 573 U. S. ___,\n___–___ (2014) (slip op., at 8–9) (assuming without decid­\ning that a fraudulent conveyance action is a “Stern claim”).\nAs the Court recounts, Wellness alleged that Sharif had\nconcealed about $5 million of assets by claiming that they\nwere owned by a trust. Wellness sought a declaratory\njudgment that the trust was in fact Sharif ’s alter ego and\nthat its assets should accordingly be part of his bankruptcy\nestate. The Bankruptcy Court granted final judgment\n(based on Sharif ’s default) to Wellness, declaring that the\ntrust assets were part of Sharif ’s estate because he had\ntreated them as his own property. Ante, at 5–6.\n  In my view, Article III likely poses no barrier to the\nBankruptcy Court’s resolution of Wellness’s claim. At its\nmost basic level, bankruptcy is “an adjudication of inter­\nests claimed in a res.” Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323,\n329 (1966) (internal quotation marks omitted). Wellness\nasked the Bankruptcy Court to declare that assets held by\nSharif are part of that res. Defining what constitutes the\n6        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nestate is the necessary starting point of every bankruptcy;\na court cannot divide up the estate without first knowing\nwhat’s in it. See 11 U. S. C. §541(a). As the Solicitor\nGeneral explains, “Identifying the property of the estate is\ntherefore inescapably central to the restructuring of the\ndebtor-creditor relationship.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 14.\n   Identifying property that constitutes the estate has long\nbeen a central feature of bankruptcy adjudication. Eng­\nlish bankruptcy commissioners had authority not only to\ncollect property in the debtor’s possession, but also to\n“cause any house or tenement of the bankrupt to be bro­\nken open,” in order to uncover and seize property the\ndebtor had concealed. 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\n*485. America’s first bankruptcy statute, enacted by\nCongress in 1800, similarly gave commissioners “power to\ntake into their possession, all the estate, real and personal,\nof every nature and description to which the [debtor] may\nbe entitled, either in law or equity, in any manner whatso­\never.” §5, 2 Stat. 23. That is peculiarly a bankruptcy\npower.\n   The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 provides further support for\nWellness’s position. Under that Act, bankruptcy referees\nhad authority to exercise “summary” jurisdiction over\ncertain claims, while other claims could only be adjudi-\ncated in “plenary” proceedings before an Article III district\ncourt. See Arkison, 573 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 4–5).\nThis Court interpreted the 1898 Act to permit bankruptcy\nreferees to exercise summary jurisdiction to determine\nwhether property in the actual or constructive possession\nof a debtor should come within the estate, at least when no\nthird party asserted more than a “merely colorable” claim\nto the property. Mueller v. Nugent, 184 U. S. 1, 15 (1902).\nIn the legal parlance of the times, a “merely colorable”\nclaim was one that existed “in appearance only, and not in\nreality.” Black’s Law Dictionary 223 (1891). So a bank­\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nruptcy referee could exercise summary jurisdiction over\nproperty in the debtor’s possession as long as no third\nparty asserted a “substantial adverse” claim. Taubel-\nScott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, 264 U. S. 426, 431–433 (1924).\n   Here, Sharif does not contest that he held legal title to\nthe assets in the trust. Assuming that no third party\nasserted a substantial adverse claim to those assets—an\ninquiry for the Bankruptcy Court on remand—Wellness’s\nalter ego claim fits comfortably into the category of cases\nthat bankruptcy referees could have decided by them­\nselves under the 1898 Act.\n   In Mueller, for example, this Court held that a bank­\nruptcy referee could exercise summary jurisdiction over\nproperty in the possession of a third party acting as the\ndebtor’s agent. 184 U. S., at 14–17; see Black’s Law Dic­\ntionary 302 (10th ed. 2014) (example of a merely “color­\nable” claim is “one made by a person holding property as an\nagent or bailee of the bankrupt”). Similarly, this Court\nheld that a bankruptcy referee could exercise summary\njurisdiction over a creditor’s claim that the debtor had\nconcealed assets under the veil of a corporate entity that\nwas “nothing but a sham and a cloak.” Sampsell v. Impe-\nrial Paper & Color Corp., 313 U. S. 215, 216–217 (1941)\n(internal quotation marks omitted), rev’g 114 F. 2d 49, 52\n(CA9 1940) (describing creditor’s claim that corporation\nwas debtor’s “alter ego”). As the Court explained in\nSampsell, the “legal existence of the affiliated corporation”\ndid not automatically require a plenary proceeding, be­\ncause “[m]ere legal paraphernalia will not suffice to trans­\nform into a substantial adverse claimant a corporation\nwhose affairs are so closely assimilated to the affairs of the\ndominant stockholder that in substance it is little more\nthan his corporate pocket.” 313 U. S., at 218. Just as the\nbankruptcy referee in that case had authority to decide\nwhether assets allegedly concealed behind the corporate\nveil belonged to the bankruptcy estate, the Bankruptcy\n8        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nCourt here had authority to decide whether the assets\nallegedly concealed in the trust belonged to Sharif ’s\nestate.\n   Sharif contends that Wellness’s alter ego claim is more\nlike an allegation of a fraudulent conveyance, which this\nCourt has implied must be adjudicated by an Article III\ncourt. See Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33,\n56 (1989); Arkison, 573 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 8–9).\nAlthough both actions aim to remedy a debtor’s deception,\nthey differ in a critical respect. A fraudulent conveyance\nclaim seeks assets in the hands of a third party, while an\nalter ego claim targets only the debtor’s “second self.”\nWebster’s New International Dictionary 76 (2d ed. 1954).\nThat distinction is significant given bankruptcy’s historic\ndomain over property within the actual or constructive\n“possession [of] the bankrupt at the time of the filing of\nthe petition.” Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 309\nU. S. 478, 481 (1940). Through a fraudulent conveyance, a\ndishonest debtor relinquishes possession of assets before\nfiling for bankruptcy. Reclaiming those assets for the\nestate requires depriving third parties of property within\ntheir otherwise lawful possession and control, an action\nthat “quintessentially” required a suit at common law.\nGranfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 56. By contrast, a debtor’s\npossession of property provided “an adequate basis” for a\nbankruptcy referee to adjudicate a dispute over title in a\nsummary proceeding. Thompson, 309 U. S., at 482; see\nMueller, 184 U. S., at 15–16 (distinguishing claim to prop­\nerty in possession of debtor’s agent from fraudulent con­\nveyance claim in determining that bankruptcy referee\ncould exercise summary jurisdiction).\n   In sum, unlike the fraudulent conveyance claim in\nGranfinanciera, Wellness’s alter ego claim alleges that\nassets within Sharif ’s actual or constructive possession\nbelong to his estate. And unlike the breach of contract\nand tort claims at issue in Northern Pipeline and Stern,\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nWellness’s claim stems not from any independent source of\nlaw but “from the bankruptcy itself.” Stern, 564 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 34). Provided that no third party asserted\na substantial adverse claim to the trust assets, Wellness’s\nclaim therefore falls within the narrow historical excep­\ntion that permits a non-Article III adjudicator in certain\nbankruptcy proceedings. I would reverse the contrary\nholding by the Court of Appeals and end our inquiry there,\nrather than deciding a broader question that may not be\nnecessary to the disposition of this case.\n                              II\n   The Court “expresses no view” on whether Wellness’s\nclaim was a Stern claim. Ante, at 8, n. 7. Instead, the\nCourt concludes that the Bankruptcy Court had constitu­\ntional authority to enter final judgment on Wellness’s\nclaim either way. The majority rests its decision on Sha­\nrif ’s purported consent to the Bankruptcy Court’s adjudi­\ncation. But Sharif has no authority to compromise the\nstructural separation of powers or agree to an exercise of\njudicial power outside Article III. His consent therefore\ncannot cure a constitutional violation.\n                              A\n   “[I]f there is a principle in our Constitution . . . more\nsacred than another,” James Madison said on the floor of\nthe First Congress, “it is that which separates the Legisla­\ntive, Executive, and Judicial powers.” 1 Annals of Cong.\n581 (1789). A strong word, “sacred.” Madison was the\nprincipal drafter of the Constitution, and he knew what he\nwas talking about. By diffusing federal powers among\nthree different branches, and by protecting each branch\nagainst incursions from the others, the Framers devised a\nstructure of government that promotes both liberty and\naccountability.

A branch’s consent to a diminution of its\nconstitutional powers therefore does not mitigate the\nharm or cure the wrong. “Liberty is always at stake when\none or more of the branches seek to transgress the separa­\ntion of powers.” Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S.\n417, 450 (1998) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). When the\nExecutive and the Legislature agreed to bypass the Article\nI, §7, requirements of bicameralism and presentment by\ncreating a Presidential line-item veto—a very pragmatic\nproposal—the Court held that the arrangement violated\nthe Constitution notwithstanding the voluntary participa­\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntion of both branches. Id., at 421 (majority opinion).\nLikewise, the Court struck down a one-House “legislative\nveto” that violated Article I, §7, even though Presidents\nand Congresses had agreed to include similar provisions in\nhundreds of laws for more than 50 years. Chadha, 462\nU. S., at 944–945.\n   In neither of these cases did the branches’ willing em­\nbrace of a separation of powers violation weaken the\nCourt’s scrutiny. To the contrary, the branches’ “enthusi­\nasm” for the offending arrangements “ ‘sharpened rather\nthan blunted’ our review.” Noel Canning, 573 U. S., at ___\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 4) (quot­\ning Chadha, 462 U. S, at 944). In short, because the\nstructural provisions of the Constitution protect liberty\nand not just government entities, “the separation of pow­\ners does not depend on . . . whether ‘the encroached-upon\nbranch approves the encroachment.’ ” PCAOB, 561 U. S.,\nat 497 (quoting New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,\n182 (1992)).\n                               B\n   If a branch of the Federal Government may not consent\nto a violation of the separation of powers, surely a private\nlitigant may not do so. Just as a branch of Government\nmay not consent away the individual liberty interest\nprotected by the separation of powers, so too an individual\nmay not consent away the institutional interest protected\nby the separation of powers. To be sure, a private litigant\nmay consensually relinquish individual constitutional\nrights. A federal criminal defendant, for example, may\nknowingly and voluntarily waive his Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial by pleading guilty to a charged offense.\nSee Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). But\nthat same defendant may not agree to stand trial on fed­\neral charges before a state court, a foreign court, or a moot\ncourt, because those courts have no constitutional author­\n12       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nity to exercise judicial power over his case, and he has no\npower to confer it. A “lack of federal jurisdiction cannot be\nwaived or be overcome by an agreement of the parties.”\nMitchell v. Maurer, 293 U. S. 237, 244 (1934).\n   As the majority recognizes, the Court’s most extensive\ndiscussion of litigant consent in a separation of powers\ncase occurred in Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v.\nSchor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986). There the Court held that\nArticle III confers both a “personal right” that can be\nwaived through consent and a structural component that\n“safeguards the role of the Judicial Branch in our tripar­\ntite system.” Id., at 848, 850. “To the extent that this\nstructural principle is implicated in a given case, the\nparties cannot by consent cure the constitutional difficulty\nfor the same reason that the parties by consent cannot\nconfer on federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction beyond\nthe limitations imposed by Article III.” Id., at 850–851.\nThus, when “Article III limitations are at issue, notions of\nconsent and waiver cannot be dispositive because the\nlimitations serve institutional interests that the parties\ncannot be expected to protect.” Id., at 851.\n   Schor’s holding that a private litigant can consent to an\nArticle III violation that affects only his “personal right”\nhas been vigorously contested. See id., at 867 (Brennan,\nJ., dissenting) (“Because the individual and structural\ninterests served by Article III are coextensive, I do not\nbelieve that a litigant may ever waive his right to an\nArticle III tribunal where one is constitutionally re­\nquired”); Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 70 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). But\nwhatever the merits of that position, nobody disputes that\nSchor forbids a litigant from consenting to a constitutional\nviolation when the structural component of Article III “is\nimplicated.” 478 U. S., at 850–851. Thus, the key inquiry\nin this case—as the majority puts it—is “whether allowing\nbankruptcy courts to decide Stern claims by consent would\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n‘impermissibly threaten the institutional integrity of the\nJudicial Branch.’ ” Ante, at 12 (quoting Schor, 478 U. S.,\nat 851; alteration omitted).\n   One need not search far to find the answer. In Stern,\nthis Court applied the analysis from Schor to bankruptcy\ncourts and concluded that they lack Article III authority to\nenter final judgments on matters now known as Stern\nclaims. The Court noted that bankruptcy courts, unlike\nthe administrative agency in Schor, were endowed by\nCongress with “substantive jurisdiction reaching any area\nof the corpus juris,” power to render final judgments en­\nforceable without any action by Article III courts, and\nauthority to adjudicate counterclaims entirely independ­\nent of the bankruptcy itself. 564 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op.,\nat 25–29). The Court concluded that allowing Congress to\nbestow such authority on non-Article III courts would\n“compromise the integrity of the system of separated\npowers and the role of the Judiciary in that system.” Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 38). If there was any room for doubt\nabout the basis for its holding, the Court dispelled it by\nasking a question: “Is there really a threat to the separa­\ntion of powers where Congress has conferred the judicial\npower outside Article III only over certain counterclaims\nin bankruptcy?” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 37). “The short but\nemphatic answer is yes.” Ibid.\n   In other words, allowing bankruptcy courts to decide\nStern claims by consent would “impermissibly threaten\nthe institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch.” Ante, at\n12 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). It is\nlittle wonder that the Court of Appeals felt itself bound by\nStern and Schor to hold that Sharif ’s consent could not\ncure the Stern violation. 727 F. 3d 751, 771 (CA7 2013).\nOther Courts of Appeals have adopted the same reading.\nSee In re BP RE, L. P., 735 F. 3d 279, 287 (CA5 2013);\nWaldman v. Stone, 698 F. 3d 910, 917–918 (CA6 2012).\n   The majority attempts to avoid this conclusion through\n14       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nan imaginative reconstruction of Stern. As the majority\nsees it, Stern “turned on the fact that the litigant ‘did not\ntruly consent to’ resolution of the claim” against him in\nthe Bankruptcy Court. Ante, at 15 (quoting 564 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 27)). That is not a proper reading of the\ndecision. The constitutional analysis in Stern, spanning\n22 pages, contained exactly one affirmative reference to\nthe lack of consent. See ibid. That reference came amid a\nlong list of factors distinguishing the proceeding in Stern\nfrom the proceedings in Schor and other “public rights”\ncases. 564 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 27–29). Stern’s\nsubsequent sentences made clear that the notions of con­\nsent relied upon by the Court in Schor did not apply in\nbankruptcy because “creditors lack an alternative forum to\nthe bankruptcy court in which to pursue their claims.”\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 28) (quoting Granfinanciera,\n492 U. S., at 59, n. 14). Put simply, the litigant in Stern\ndid not consent because he could not consent given the\nnature of bankruptcy.\n  There was an opinion in Stern that turned heavily on\nconsent: the dissent. 564 U. S., at ___–___ (opinion of\nBREYER, J.) (slip op., at 12–14). The Stern majority re­\nsponded to the dissent with a counterfactual: Even if\nconsent were relevant to the analysis, that factor would\nnot change the result because the litigant did not truly\nconsent. Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 28–29). Moreover,\nStern held that “it does not matter who” authorizes a\nbankruptcy judge to render final judgments on Stern\nclaims, because the “constitutional bar remains.” Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 36). That holding is incompatible with the\nmajority’s conclusion today that two litigants can author­\nize a bankruptcy judge to render final judgments on Stern\nclaims, despite the constitutional bar that remains.\n  The majority also relies heavily on the supervision and\ncontrol that Article III courts exercise over bankruptcy\ncourts. Ante, at 12–15. As the majority notes, court of\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            15\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nappeals judges appoint bankruptcy judges, and bankruptcy\njudges receive cases only on referral from district courts\n(although every district court in the country has adopted a\nstanding rule automatically referring all bankruptcy\nfilings to bankruptcy judges, see 1 Collier on Bankruptcy\n¶3.02[1], p. 3–26 (16th ed. 2014)). The problem is that\nCongress has also given bankruptcy courts authority to\nenter final judgments subject only to deferential appellate\nreview, and Article III precludes those judgments when\nthey involve Stern claims. The fact that Article III judges\nplayed a role in the Article III violation does not remedy\nthe constitutional harm. We have already explained why.\n   It is a fundamental principle that no branch of govern­\nment can delegate its constitutional functions to an actor\nwho lacks authority to exercise those functions. See\nWhitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457,\n472 (2001); Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 311\n(1936). Such delegations threaten liberty and thwart\naccountability by empowering entities that lack the struc­\ntural protections the Framers carefully devised. See\nDepartment of Transportation v. Association of American\nRailroads, 575 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015) (ALITO, J., con­\ncurring) (slip op., at 6–7); id., at ___–___ (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2–3); Mistretta v.\nUnited States, 488 U. S. 361, 417–422 (1989) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting). Article III judges have no constitutional\nauthority to delegate the judicial power—the power to\n“render dispositive judgments”—to non-Article III judges,\nno matter how closely they control or supervise their\nwork. Plaut, 514 U. S., at 219 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   In any event, the majority’s arguments about supervi­\nsion and control are not new. They were considered and\nrejected in Stern. See 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 36) (“it\ndoes not matter who appointed the bankruptcy judge or\nauthorized the judge to render final judgments”); see also\n16       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nNorthern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 84–86 (plurality opinion);\nid., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). The\nmajority points to no differences between the bankruptcy\nproceeding in Stern and the bankruptcy proceeding here,\nexcept for Sharif ’s purported consent. The majority thus\ntreats consent as “dispositive” in curing the structural\nseparation of powers violation—precisely what Schor said\nconsent could not do. 478 U. S., at 851.\n                               C\n   Eager to change the subject from Stern, the majority\ndevotes considerable attention to defending the authority\nof magistrate judges, who may conduct certain proceed­\nings with the consent of the parties under 28 U. S. C.\n§636. No one here challenges the constitutionality of\nmagistrate judges or disputes that they, like bankruptcy\njudges, may issue reports and recommendations that are\nreviewed de novo by Article III judges. The cases about\nmagistrate judges cited by the majority therefore have\nlittle bearing on this case, because none of them involved a\nconstitutional challenge to the entry of final judgment by a\nnon-Article III actor. See Roell v. Withrow, 538 U. S. 580\n(2003) (statutory challenge only); Peretz v. United States,\n501 U. S. 923 (1991) (challenge to a magistrate judge’s\nconduct of voir dire in a felony trial); Gomez v. United\nStates, 490 U. S. 858 (1989) (same).\n   The majority also points to 19th-century cases in which\ncourts referred disputes to non-Article III referees, mas­\nters, or arbitrators. Ante, at 8. In those cases, however, it\nwas the Article III court that ultimately entered final\njudgment. E.g., Thornton v. Carson, 7 Cranch 596, 600\n(1813) (“the Court was right in entering the judgment for\nthe sums awarded”). Article III courts do refer matters to\nnon-Article III actors for assistance from time to time.\nThis Court does so regularly in original jurisdiction cases.\nSee, e.g., Kansas v. Nebraska, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n(slip op., at 1). But under the Constitution, the “ultimate\nresponsibility for deciding” the case must remain with the\nArticle III court. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Colo-\nrado v. New Mexico, 467 U. S. 310, 317 (1984)).\n   The concurrence’s comparison of bankruptcy judges to\narbitrators is similarly inapt. Ante, at 1 (opinion of ALITO,\nJ.). Arbitration is “a matter of contract” by which parties\nagree to resolve their disputes in a private forum. Rent-A-\nCenter, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. 63, 67 (2010).\nSuch an arrangement does not implicate Article III any\nmore than does an agreement between two business part­\nners to submit a difference of opinion to a mutually trusted\nfriend. Arbitration agreements, like most private con­\ntracts, can be enforced in court. And Congress, pursuant\nto its Commerce Clause power, has authorized district\ncourts to enter judgments enforcing arbitration awards\nunder certain circumstances. See 9 U. S. C. §9. But this\nordinary scheme of contract enforcement creates no consti­\ntutional concern. As the concurrence acknowledges, only\nArticle III judges—not arbitrators—may enter final judg­\nments enforcing arbitration awards. Ante, at 1.\n   The discussion of magistrate judges, masters, arbitra­\ntors, and the like fits with the majority’s focus on the\nsupposedly dire consequences that would follow a decision\nthat parties cannot consent to the final adjudication of\nStern claims in bankruptcy courts. Of course, it “goes\nwithout saying” that practical considerations of efficiency\nand convenience cannot trump the structural protections\nof the Constitution. Stern, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n36); see Perez, 575 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment) (slip op., at 20) (“Even in the face of perceived\nnecessity, the Constitution protects us from ourselves.”).\nAnd I find it hard to believe that the Framers in Philadel­\nphia, who took great care to ensure that the Judiciary was\n“truly distinct” from the Legislature, would have been\ncomforted to know that Congress’s incursion here could\n18       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n“only be termed de minimis.” Ante, at 13 (quoting Schor,\n478 U. S., at 856).\n   In any event, the majority overstates the consequences\nof enforcing the requirements of Article III in this case. As\nexplained in Part I, Wellness’s claim may not be a Stern\nclaim, in which case the bankruptcy statute would apply\nprecisely as Congress wrote it. Even if Wellness’s claim\nwere a Stern claim, the District Court would not need to\nstart from scratch. As this Court held in Arkison, the\nDistrict Court could treat the bankruptcy judge’s decision\nas a recommendation and enter judgment after performing\nde novo review. 573 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n   In Stern, the Court cautioned that Congress “may no\nmore lawfully chip away at the authority of the Judicial\nBranch than it may eliminate it entirely.” 564 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 37). The majority sees no reason to fret,\nhowever, so long as two private parties consent. Ante, at\n14, n. 10. But such parties are unlikely to carefully weigh\nthe long-term structural independence of the Article III\njudiciary against their own short-term priorities. Perhaps\nthe majority’s acquiescence in this diminution of constitu­\ntional authority will escape notice. Far more likely, how­\never, it will amount to the kind of “blueprint for extensive\nexpansion of the legislative power” that we have resisted\nin the past. PCAOB, 561 U. S., at 500 (quoting Metropoli-\ntan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for Abate-\nment of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 277 (1991)).\n   The encroachment at issue here may seem benign\nenough. Bankruptcy judges are devoted professionals who\nstrive to be fair to all sides, and litigants can be trusted to\nprotect their own interests when deciding whether to\nconsent. But the fact remains that Congress controls the\nsalary and tenure of bankruptcy judges, and the Legisla­\nture’s present solicitude provides no guarantee of its fu­\nture restraint. See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530,\n534 (1962) (plurality opinion). Once Congress knows that\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nit can assign federal claims to judges outside Article III\nwith the parties’ consent, nothing would limit its exercise\nof that power to bankruptcy. Congress may consider it\nadvantageous to allow claims to be heard before judges\nsubject to greater legislative control in any number of\nareas of federal concern. As for the requirement of con­\nsent, Congress can find ways to “encourage” consent, say\nby requiring it as a condition of federal benefits. That has\nworked to expand Congress’s power before. See, e.g.,\nCollege Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary\nEd. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999) (“Congress\nmay, in the exercise of its spending power, condition its\ngrant of funds to the States upon their taking certain\nactions that Congress could not require them to take”);\nSouth Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 207 (1987) (same).\n   Legislative designs of this kind would not displace the\nArticle III judiciary overnight. But steady erosion of\nArticle III authority, no less than a brazen usurpation,\nviolates the constitutional separation of powers. In a\nFederal Government of limited powers, one branch’s loss is\nanother branch’s gain, see PCAOB, 561 U. S., at 500, so\nwhether a branch aims to “arrogate power to itself ” or to\n“impair another in the performance of its constitutional\nduties,” the Constitution forbids the transgression all the\nsame. Loving, 517 U. S., at 757. As we have cautioned,\n“[s]light encroachments create new boundaries from which\nlegions of power can seek new territory to capture.” Stern,\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 38) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   The Framers understood this danger. They warned that\nthe Legislature would inevitably seek to draw greater\npower into its “impetuous vortex,” The Federalist No. 48,\nat 309 (J. Madison), and that “power over a man’s subsist­\nence amounts to a power over his will,” id., No. 79, at 472\n(A. Hamilton) (emphasis deleted). In response, the Fram­\ners adopted the structural protections of Article III, “es­\n20       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntablishing high walls and clear distinctions because low\nwalls and vague distinctions will not be judicially defensi­\nble in the heat of interbranch conflict.” Plaut, 514 U. S., at\n239. As this Court once put it, invoking Frost, “Good\nfences make good neighbors.” Id., at 240.\n  Ultimately, however, the structural protections of Arti­\ncle III are only as strong as this Court’s will to enforce\nthem. In Madison’s words, the “great security against a\ngradual concentration of the several powers in the same\ndepartment consists in giving to those who administer\neach department the necessary constitutional means and\npersonal motives to resist encroachments of the others.”\nThe Federalist No. 51, at 321–322 (J. Madison). The\nCourt today declines to resist encroachment by the Legis­\nlature. Instead it holds that a single federal judge, for\nreasons adequate to him, may assign away our hard-won\nconstitutional birthright so long as two private parties\nagree. I hope I will be wrong about the consequences of\nthis decision for the independence of the Judicial Branch.\nBut for now, another literary passage comes to mind: It\nprofits the Court nothing to give its soul for the whole\nworld . . . but to avoid Stern claims?\n  I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

See Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___ (2011). I write\nseparately to highlight a few questions touching on the\nconsent issue that merit closer attention than either the\nCourt or THE CHIEF JUSTICE gives them.\n  I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that individuals cannot\nconsent to violations of the Constitution, but this principle\nhas nothing to do with whose interest the violated provi-\nsion protects. Anytime the Federal Government acts in a\nmanner inconsistent with the separation of powers, it acts\nin excess of its constitutional authority. That authority is\ncarefully defined by the Constitution, and, except through\nArticle V’s amendment process, that document does not\npermit individuals to bestow additional power upon the\nGovernment.\n  The majority today authorizes non-Article III courts to\nadjudicate, with consent, claims that we have held to\nrequire an exercise of the judicial power based on its as-\nsessment that few “structural interests” are implicated by\nconsent to the adjudication of Stern claims. See ante, at 7,\n12. That reasoning is flawed. It matters not whether we\nthink the particular violation threatens the structure of\n2        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nour Government. Our duty is to enforce the Constitution\nas written, not as revised by private consent, innocuous or\notherwise. Worse, amidst the tempest over whether\n“structural interests” are implicated when an individual\nconsents to adjudication of Stern claims by a non-Article\nIII court, both the majority and THE CHIEF JUSTICE fail to\ngrapple with the antecedent question: whether a violation\nof the Constitution has actually occurred. That question is\na difficult one, and the majority makes a grave mistake by\nskipping over it in its quest to answer the question whether\nconsent can authorize a constitutional violation. Because\nI would resolve this case on narrower grounds, I need not\ndecide that question here. I nevertheless write separately\nto highlight the complexity of the issues the majority\nsimply brushes past.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   “The principle, that [the Federal Government] can\nexercise only the powers granted to it, . . . is now univer-\nsally admitted.” McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1320585/mcculloch-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n405 (1819). A corollary to this principle is that each\nbranch of the Government is limited to the exercise of\nthose powers granted to it. Every violation of the separa-\ntion of powers thus involves an exercise of power in excess\nof the Constitution. And because the only authorities\ncapable of granting power are the Constitution itself, and\nthe people acting through the amendment process, indi-\nvidual consent cannot authorize the Government to exceed\nconstitutional boundaries.\n   This does not mean, however, that consent is invariably\nirrelevant to the constitutional inquiry. Although it may\nnot authorize a constitutional violation, consent may\nprevent one from occurring in the first place. This concept\nis perhaps best understood with the example on which the\nmajority and THE CHIEF JUSTICE both rely: the right to a\n                      Cite as: 575 U.

J., dissenting).1 Although the Government\nincurably contravenes the Constitution when it acts in\nviolation of the jury trial right, our precedents permit the\nGovernment to convict a criminal defendant without a\njury trial when he waives that right. See Brady v. United\nStates, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). The defendant’s waiver\nis thus a form of consent that lifts a limitation on govern-\nment action by satisfying its terms—that is, the right is\nexercised and honored, not disregarded. See Patton v.\nUnited States, 281 U. S. 276, 296–298 (1930), abrogated on\nother grounds by Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78 (1970).\nProvided the Government otherwise acts within its pow-\ners, there is no constitutional violation.\n                              B\n  Consent to the adjudication of Stern claims by bank-\nruptcy courts is a far more complex matter than waiver of\na jury trial. Two potential violations of the separation of\npowers occur whenever bankruptcy courts adjudicate\nStern claims. First, the bankruptcy courts purport to\nexercise power that the Constitution vests exclusively in\nthe judiciary, even though they are not Article III courts\nbecause bankruptcy judges do not enjoy the tenure and\nsalary protections required by Article III. See Art. III, §1.\nSecond, the bankruptcy courts act pursuant to statutory\nauthorization that is itself invalid. For even when acting\npursuant to an enumerated power, such as the bankruptcy\n\n——————\n  1 There is some dispute whether the guarantee of a jury trial protects\nan individual right, a structural right, or both, raising serious questions\nabout how it should be treated under Commodity Futures Trading\nComm’n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986). My view, which does not turn\non such taxonomies, leaves no doubt: It is a “fundamental reservation\nof power in our constitutional structure,” Blakely v. Washington, 542\nU. S. 296, 306 (2004), meaning its violation may not be authorized by\nthe consent of the individual.\n4        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npower, Congress exceeds its authority when it purports to\nauthorize a person or entity to perform a function that\nrequires the exercise of a power vested elsewhere by the\nConstitution. See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns.,\nInc., 531 U. S. 457, 472 (2001).\n   Rather than attempt to grapple with these problems,\nthe majority seizes on some statements from Commodity\nFutures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986), to\nresolve the difficult constitutional issue before us. See\nante, at 9–12. But to the extent Schor suggests that indi-\nvidual consent could authorize non-Article III courts to\nexercise the judicial power, 478 U. S., at 850–851, it was\nwrongly decided and should be abandoned. Consent to\nadjudication by non-Article III judges may waive whatever\nindividual right to impartial adjudication Article III im-\nplies, thereby lifting that affirmative barrier on Govern-\nment action. But non-Article III courts must still act\nwithin the bounds of their constitutional authority. That\nis, they must act through a power properly delegated to\nthe Federal Government and not vested by the Constitu-\ntion in a different governmental actor. Because the judi-\ncial power is vested exclusively in Article III courts, non-\nArticle III courts may not exercise it.\n   Schor’s justification for authorizing such a transgression\nwas that it judged the “practical effect [the allocation\nwould] have on the constitutionally assigned role of the\nfederal judiciary” not to be too great. Id., at 851. But we\n“can[not] preserve a system of separation of powers on the\nbasis of such intuitive judgments regarding ‘practical\neffects.’ ” Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33,\n70 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). Put more starkly, “[t]o uphold” a violation of\nthe Constitution because one perceives “the infraction\nassailed [a]s unimportant when compared with similar but\nmore serious infractions which might be conceived . . . is\nnot to interpret that instrument, but to disregard it.”\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

Our Constitution is not a matter of\nconvenience, to be invoked when we feel uncomfortable\nwith some Government action and cast aside when we do\nnot. See Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., ante, at 5\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n                              II\n  Properly understood, then, the answer to the consent\nquestion in this case depends on whether bankruptcy\ncourts act within the bounds of their constitutional au-\nthority when they adjudicate Stern claims with the con-\nsent of the parties. In order to answer that question, we\nmust consider what form of governmental power that type\nof adjudication requires and whether bankruptcy courts\nare qualified to exercise that power. Department of\nTransportation v. Association of American Railroads, ante,\nat 24 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n  Many Government functions “may be performed by two\nor more branches without either exceeding its enumerated\npowers under the Constitution.” Ante, at 4. Certain core\nfunctions, however, demand the exercise of legislative,\nexecutive, or judicial power, and their allocation is con-\ntrolled by the Vesting Clauses contained in the first three\narticles of the Constitution. Ibid. We have already held\nthat adjudicating Stern claims, at least without consent of\nthe parties, requires an exercise of the judicial power\nvested exclusively in Article III courts. Stern, 564 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 28–29). The difficult question pre-\nsented by this case, which the Court glosses over, is\nwhether the parties’ consent somehow transforms the\nnature of the power exercised.\n                         A\n  As the concepts were understood at the time of the\n6        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfounding, the legislative, executive, and judicial powers\nplayed different roles in the resolution of cases and con-\ntroversies. In this context, the judicial power is the power\n“to determine all differences according to the established\nlaw”; the legislative power is the power to make that\n“established law”; and the executive power is the power “to\nback and support the sentence, and to give it due execu-\ntion.” J.

The distinction generally has to\ndo with the types of rights at issue. Disposition of private\nrights to life, liberty, and property falls within the core of\nthe judicial power, whereas disposition of public rights\ndoes not. From that core of the judicial power, we have\nidentified two narrow historical exceptions. Those excep-\ntions, along with the treatment of cases or controversies\nnot falling within that core, provide useful guidance for\nunderstanding whether bankruptcy courts’ adjudication of\nStern claims with the consent of the parties requires the\nexercise of Article III judicial power.\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

Northern Pipeline\nConstr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 63–67\n(1982) (plurality opinion).\n  The first two represent unique historical exceptions that\ntell us little about the overall scope of the judicial power.\nFrom an early date, this Court has long upheld laws au-\nthorizing the adjudication of cases arising in the territo-\nries in non-Article III “territorial courts” on the ground\nthat such courts exercise power “conferred by Congress, in\nthe execution of those general powers which [Congress]\npossesses over the territories of the United States.” Amer-\nican Ins.

Lawson, Territo-\nrial Governments and the Limits of Formalism, 78 Cal. L. Rev. 853, 892\n(1990) (criticizing it as “fatuous” dictum). On the one hand, some early\nevidence suggests that the courts were thought to be dealing primarily\nwith local matters that lie beyond federal judicial cognizance. Pfander,\nArticle I Tribunals, Article III Courts, and the Judicial Power of the\nUnited States, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 643, 706–711 (2004). Yet Canter\ninvolved a controversy indisputably capable of adjudication by Article\nIII courts, because it both arose in admiralty and fell within the Su-\npreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction. Pfander, supra, at 713–714, n.\n314. The best explanation for this apparent tension is that territorial\ncourts adjudicate matters that Congress may or may not assign to\nArticle III courts, as it wishes. Nelson, Adjudication in the Political\nBranches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 575–576 (2007). To recognize\nCongress’ discretion requires no distortion of the meaning of judicial\npower because Chief Justice Marshall’s reasoning has nothing to do\nwith the intrinsic qualities of the adjudication itself—e.g., whether it\ninvolves “the stuff of the traditional actions at common law tried by the\n8         WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v.

Whatever their historical validity, these prece-\ndents exempt cases arising in the territories and in the\nland and naval forces from Article III because of other\nprovisions of the Constitution, not because of the defini-\ntion of judicial power in Article III itself. See Nelson,\nAdjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev.\n559, 576 (2007) (noting that both exceptions enjoy “special\ntextual rationales that d[o] not spill over into other\nareas”).\n   The third category consists of so-called “public rights”\ncases. Unlike the other two categories, which reflect\ncarve-outs from the core of the judicial power, this cate-\ngory describes cases outside of that core and therefore has\nmore to tell us about the scope of the judicial power.\n   The distinction between disputes involving “public\nrights” and those involving “private rights” is longstand-\ning, but the contours of the “public rights” doctrine have\nbeen the source of much confusion and controversy. See\ngenerally Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 66–70 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.) (tracing the evolution of the doctrine). Our\ncases attribute the doctrine to this Court’s mid-19th cen-\ntury decision, Murray’s Lessee, supra. In that case, the\nCourt observed that there are certain cases addressing\n“public rights, which may be presented in such form that\nthe judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which\nare susceptible of judicial determination, but which con-\ngress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the\n—————— \n\ncourts of Westminster in 1789,” Stern v.

Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wend.</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (N. Y. 1829) (Walworth, C.).\nThis distinction is significant to our understanding of\nArticle III, for while the legislative and executive branches\nmay dispose of public rights at will—including through\nnon-Article III adjudications—an exercise of the judicial\npower is required “when the government want[s] to act\nauthoritatively upon core private rights that had vested in\na particular individual.” Nelson, supra, at 569; see B&B\nHardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., ante, at 11\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   The distinction was well known at the time of the found-\ning. In the tradition of John Locke, William Blackstone in\nhis Commentaries identified the private rights to life,\nliberty, and property as the three “absolute” rights—so\ncalled because they “appertain[ed] and belong[ed] to par-\nticular men . . . merely as individuals,” not “to them as\nmembers of society [or] standing in various relations to\neach other”—that is, not dependent upon the will of the\ngovernment. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 119 (1765) (Commentaries); see also Nelson,\nsupra, at 567.3 Public rights, by contrast, belonged to “the\nwhole community, considered as a community, in its social\naggregate capacity.” 4 Commentaries 5 (1769); see also\nNelson, supra, at 567. As the modern doctrine of the\n——————\n  3 The protection of private rights in the Anglo-American tradition\n\ngoes back to at least Magna Carta.

L. Rev. 401, 413\n(1958).\n   The Founders carried this idea forward into the Vesting\nClauses of our Constitution. Those Clauses were under-\nstood to play a role in ensuring that the federal courts\nalone could act to deprive individuals of private rights\nbecause the power to act conclusively against those rights\nwas the core of the judicial power. As one early treatise\nexplained, the judiciary is “that department of the gov-\nernment to whom the protection of the rights of the indi-\nvidual is by the constitution especially confided.” 1 St.\nGeorge Tucker, Blackstone’s Commentaries, App. 357\n(1803). If “public rights” were not thought to fall within\nthe core of the judicial power, then that could explain why\nCongress would be able to perform or authorize non-\nArticle III adjudications of public rights without trans-\ngressing Article III’s Vesting Clause.\n   Nineteenth-century American jurisprudence confirms\nthat an exercise of the judicial power was thought to be\nnecessary for the disposition of private, but not public,\nrights.4 See B&B Hardware, ante, at 12. The treatment of\n——————\n   4 Contemporary state-court decisions provide even more explication of\n\nthe distinction between public and private rights, and many expressly\ntie the distinction to the separation of powers.

See generally Nelson, 107 Colum. L. Rev., at\n577–578 (discussing land patents).         That differential\ntreatment reflected the fact that, once “legal title passed\nout of the United States,” the patent “[u]ndoubtedly”\nconstituted “a vested right” and consequently could “only\nbe divested according to law.” Johnson v. Towsley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88438\"><a href=\"/opinion/88438/johnson-v-towsley/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84–85 (1871). By contrast, a party who sought to\nprotect only a “public right” in the land had no such vested\nright and could not invoke the intervention of Article III\ncourts. See Smelting Co. v. Kemp, 104 U.

See B&B Hardware, ante, at 9–10, 12.\nThe source of the confusion may be Murray’s Lessee—the\nputative source of the public rights doctrine itself. Dic-\ntum in the case muddles the distinction between private\nand public rights, and the decision is perhaps better\nread as an expression of the principle of sovereign im-\nmunity. Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 68–69 (opinion of\n\n——————\nof person between private parties is judicial, and can only be conferred\non the courts”); see generally T.

See, e.g.,\nCrowell v. Benson, 285 U.

McAnnulty, 187 U. S. 94, 108 (1902), and\nothers treating what appear to be private rights as public\nrights on which executive action could be conclusive, see,\ne.g., Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v.

To the extent that Murray’s Lessee\npurported to recognize such an exception, how-ever, it did so only in\ndictum after noting that the statute provided a mechanism for judicial\nreview of the accounting decision on which the distress warrant was\nbased. 18 How., at 280–281.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Plank, Why\nBankruptcy Judges Need Not and Should Not Be Article\nIII Judges, 72 Am. Bankr. L. J. 567, 608 (1998) (describing\nthe bankruptcy powers vested by Congress in non-Article\nIII judges). Modern bankruptcy courts, however, adjudi-\ncate a far broader array of disputes than their earliest\nhistorical counterparts. And this Court has remained\ncarefully noncommittal about the source of their authority\nto do so. See Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 71 (plurality\nopinion).\n  Applying the historical categories of cases discussed\nabove, one can understand why. Bankruptcy courts clearly\ndo not qualify as territorial courts or courts-martial, but\nthey are not an easy fit in the “public rights” category,\neither. No doubt certain aspects of bankruptcy involve\nrights lying outside the core of the judicial power. The\nmost obvious of these is the right to discharge, which a\nparty may obtain if he satisfies certain statutory criteria.\nIbid. Discharge is not itself a private right, but, together\nwith the claims allowance process that precedes it, it can\nact conclusively on the core private rights of the debtor’s\ncreditors. We have nevertheless implicitly recognized that\nthe claims allowance process may proceed in a bankruptcy\ncourt, as can any matter that would necessarily be re-\nsolved by that process, even one that affects core private\nrights. Stern, 564 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 30–31).\nFor this reason, bankruptcy courts and their prede-\n14       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncessors more likely enjoy a unique, textually based excep-\ntion, much like territorial courts and courts-martial do.\nSee id., at ___ (SCALIA, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).\nThat is, Article I’s Bankruptcy Clause serves to carve\ncases and controversies traditionally subject to resolution\nby bankruptcy commissioners out of Article III, giving\nCongress the discretion, within those historical bounda-\nries, to provide for their resolution outside of Article III\ncourts.\n                              3\n   Because Stern claims by definition fall outside of the\nhistorical boundaries of the bankruptcy carve-out, they are\nsubject to Article III. This means that, if their adjudica-\ntion requires the exercise of the judicial power, then only\nArticle III courts may perform it.\n   Although Stern claims indisputably involve private\nrights, the “public rights” doctrine suggests a way in\nwhich party consent may transform the function of adjudi-\ncating Stern claims into one that does not require the\nexercise of the judicial power. The premise of the “public\nrights” doctrine, as described above, is not that public\nrights affirmatively require adjudication by some other\ngovernmental power, but that the Government has a freer\nhand when private rights are not at issue. Accordingly,\nthis premise may not require the presence of a public right\nat all, but may apply equally to any situation in which\nprivate rights are not asserted.\n   Party consent, in turn, may have the effect of lifting that\n“private rights” bar, much in the way that waiver lifts the\nbar imposed by the right to a jury trial. Individuals may\ndispose of their own private rights freely, without judicial\nintervention. A party who consents to adjudication of a\nStern claim by a bankruptcy court is merely making a\nconditional surrender of whatever private right he has on\nthe line, contingent on some future event—namely, that\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            15\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe bankruptcy court rules against him. Indeed, it is on\nthis logic that the law has long encouraged and permitted\nprivate settlement of disputes, including through the\naction of an arbitrator not vested with the judicial power.\nSee ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 399\n(1868). Perhaps for this reason, decisions discussing the\nrelationship between private rights and the judicial power\nhave emphasized the “involuntary divestiture” of a private\nright. Newland v. Marsh, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 382–383 (1857)\n(emphasis added).\n   But all of this does not necessarily mean that the major-\nity has wound up in the right place by the wrong path.\nEven if consent could lift the private-rights barrier to non-\njudicial Government action, it would not necessarily follow\nthat consent removes the Stern adjudication from the core\nof the judicial power. There may be other aspects of the\nadjudication that demand the exercise of the judicial\npower, such as entry of a final judgment enforceable with-\nout any further action by an Article III court. We have\nrecognized that judgments entered by Article III courts\nbear unique qualities that spring from the exercise of the\njudicial power, Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S.\n211, 218–219 (1995), and it may be that the entry of a\nfinal judgment bearing these qualities—irrespective of the\nsubject matter of the dispute—is a quintessential judicial\nfunction. See ante, at 16–17 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting).\nSee generally Northern Pipeline, supra, at 85–86, and n.\n38 (plurality opinion) (distinguishing the agency orders at\nissue in Crowell from bankruptcy court orders on this\nground). As Thomas Cooley explained in his influential\ntreatise, “If the judges should sit to hear . . . controversies\n[beyond their cognizance], they would not sit as a court; at\nthe most they would be arbitrators only, and their . . .\ndecision could not be binding as a judgment, but only as\n16         WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nan award.” Cooley, supra, at 399.6\n  Ultimately, this case implicates difficult questions about\nthe nature of bankruptcy procedure, judicial power, and\nremedies. In particular, if we were to determine that\ncurrent practice accords bankruptcy court judgments a\nfeature that demands the exercise of the judicial power,\nwould that mean that all bankruptcy judgments resolving\nStern claims are void, or only that courts may not give\neffect to that single feature that triggers Article III? The\nparties have briefed none of these issues, so I do not re-\nsolve them. But the number and magnitude of these\nimportant questions—questions implicated by thousands\nof bankruptcy and magistrate judge decisions each year—\nmerit closer attention than the majority has given them.\n\n——————\n  6 Numerous 19th-century State Supreme Courts held unconstitutional\n\nlaws authorizing individuals to consent to have their cases heard by an\nindividual not qualified as a judge under provisions of State Consti-\ntutions similar to Article III, §1.

Acknowl-\nedging the similarity between the practices under review and the\nlegitimate practice of private arbitration, many of these decisions\npremised their finding of unconstitutionality on the issuance of a\njudgment or other writ that only judges may issue.

As instrumen-\ntalities of the Federal Government, the bankruptcy courts\nmust act pursuant to some constitutional grant of author-\nity. Even if the functions bankruptcy courts perform do not\nrequire an exercise of legislative, executive, or judicial\npower, we would need to identify the source of Congress’\nauthority to establish them and to authorize them to act.\n   The historical carve-outs for territorial courts and\ncourts-martial might provide some guidance. The Court\nhas anchored Congress’ authority to create territorial\ncourts in “the general right of sovereignty which exists in\nthe government, or in virtue of that clause which enables\nCongress to make all needful rules and regulations, re-\nspecting the territory belonging to the United States.”\nCanter, 1 Pet., at 546. And it has anchored Congress’\nauthority to create courts-martial in Congress’ Article I\npowers concerning the Army and Navy, understood along-\nside the Sixth Amendment’s exception of “ ‘cases arising in\nthe land or naval forces,’ ” from the grand jury require-\nment, and Article II’s requirement that the President\nserve as commander in chief. Dynes, 20 How., at 78–79.\n   Although our cases examining the constitutionality of\nstatutes allocating the power to the bankruptcy courts\nhave not considered the source of Congress’ authority to\nestablish them, the obvious textual basis is the fourth\nclause of Article I, §8, which empowers Congress to “estab-\nlish . . . uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies\nthroughout the United States.”7 But as with the other two\n——————\n  7 In Northern Pipeline, the plurality rejected the argument that “Con-\n\ngress’ constitutional authority to establish ‘uniform Laws on the subject\nof Bankruptcies throughout the United States’ carries with it an\n18         WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v.

J., dissenting). Although Stern\nclaims, by definition, lie outside those historical bounda-\nries, a historical practice of allowing broader adjudication\nby bankruptcy commissioners acting with the consent of\nthe parties could alter the analysis. The parties once\nagain do not brief these questions, but they merit closer\nattention by this Court.\n                        *     *    *\n   Whether parties may consent to bankruptcy court adju-\ndication of Stern claims is a difficult constitutional ques-\ntion. It turns on issues that are not adequately considered\nby the Court or briefed by the parties. And it cannot—and\nshould not—be resolved through a cursory reading of\nSchor, which itself is hardly a model of careful constitu-\ntional interpretation. For these reasons, I would resolve\n——————\ninherent power to establish legislative courts capable of adjudicating\n‘bankruptcy-related controversies.’ ” Northern Pipeline Constr.

In that context, however, it was considering whether\nArticle III imposes limits on Congress’ bankruptcy power, id., at 73,\nwhich is a distinct question from whether Congress has the power to\nestablish bankruptcy courts as an antecedent matter, leaving aside any\nArticle III limitations.\n   8 I would be wary of concluding that every grant of lawmaking au-\n\nthority to Congress includes the power to establish “legislative courts”\nas part of its legislative scheme. Some have suggested that Congress’\nauthority to establish tribunals pursuant to substantive grants of\nauthority is informed and limited by its Article I power to “constitute\nTribunals inferior to the supreme Court,” U.

SHARIF\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 13–935.      Argued January 14, 2015—Decided May 26, 2015\nRespondent Richard Sharif tried to discharge a debt he owed petition-\n  ers, Wellness International Network, Ltd., and its owners (collective-\n  ly Wellness), in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Wellness sought, inter\n  alia, a declaratory judgment from the Bankruptcy Court, contending\n  that a trust Sharif claimed to administer was in fact Sharif’s alter-\n  ego, and that its assets were his personal property and part of his\n  bankruptcy estate. The Bankruptcy Court eventually entered a de-\n  fault judgment against Sharif. While Sharif’s appeal was pending in\n  District Court, but before briefing concluded, this Court held that Ar-\n  ticle III forbids bankruptcy courts to enter a final judgment on claims\n  that seek only to “augment” the bankruptcy estate and would other-\n  wise “exis[t] without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.” Stern v.\n  Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, ___. After briefing closed, Sharif sought\n  permission to file a supplemental brief raising a Stern objection. The\n  District Court denied the motion, finding it untimely, and affirmed\n  the Bankruptcy Court’s judgment. As relevant here, the Seventh\n  Circuit determined that Sharif’s Stern objection could not be waived\n  because it implicated structural interests and reversed on the alter-\n  ego claim, holding that the Bankruptcy Court lacked constitutional\n  authority to enter final judgment on that claim.\nHeld:\n    1. Article III permits bankruptcy judges to adjudicate Stern claims\n with the parties’ knowing and voluntary consent. Pp. 8–17.\n       (a) The foundational case supporting the adjudication of legal\n disputes by non-Article III judges with the consent of the parties is\n Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833. There,\n the Court held that the right to adjudication before an Article III\n2            WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    court is “personal” and therefore “subject to waiver.” Id., at 848. The\n    Court also recognized that if Article III’s structural interests as “ ‘an\n    inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and bal-\n    ances’ ” are implicated, “the parties cannot by consent cure the consti-\n    tutional difficulty.” Id., at 850–851. The importance of consent was\n    reiterated in two later cases involving the Federal Magistrates Act’s\n    assignment of non-Article III magistrate judges to supervise voir dire\n    in felony trials. In Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858, the Court\n    held that a magistrate judge was not permitted to select a jury with-\n    out the defendant’s consent, id., at 864. But in Peretz v. United\n    States, 501 U. S. 923, the Court stated that “the defendant’s consent\n    significantly changes the constitutional analysis,” id., at 932. Be-\n    cause an Article III court retained supervisory authority over the\n    process, the Court found “no structural protections . . . implicated”\n    and upheld the Magistrate Judge’s action. Id., at 937. Pp. 8–12.\n         (b) The question whether allowing bankruptcy courts to decide\n    Stern claims by consent would “impermissibly threate[n] the institu-\n    tional integrity of the Judicial Branch,” Schor, 478 U. S., at 851, must\n    be decided “with an eye to the practical effect that the” practice “will\n    have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary,”\n    ibid. For several reasons, this practice does not usurp the constitu-\n    tional prerogatives of Article III courts. Bankruptcy judges are ap-\n    pointed and may be removed by Article III judges, see 28 U. S. C.\n    §§152(a)(1), (e); “serve as judicial officers of the United States district\n    court,” §151; and collectively “constitute a unit of the district court”\n    for the district in which they serve, §152(a)(1). Bankruptcy courts\n    hear matters solely on a district court’s reference, §157(a), and pos-\n    sess no free-floating authority to decide claims traditionally heard by\n    Article III courts, see Schor, 478 U. S., at 854, 856. “[T]he decision to\n    invoke” the bankruptcy court’s authority “is left entirely to the par-\n    ties,” id., at 855, and “the power of the federal judiciary to take juris-\n    diction” remains in place, ibid. Finally, there is no indication that\n    Congress gave bankruptcy courts the ability to decide Stern claims in\n    an effort to aggrandize itself or humble the Judiciary. See, e.g.,\n    Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937. Pp. 12–15.\n         (c) Stern does not compel a different result. It turned on the fact\n    that the litigant “did not truly consent to” resolution of the claim\n    against it in a non-Article III forum, 564 U. S., at ___, and thus, does\n    not govern the question whether litigants may validly consent to ad-\n    judication by a bankruptcy court. Moreover, expanding Stern to hold\n    that a litigant may not waive the right to an Article III court through\n    consent would be inconsistent with that opinion’s own description of\n    its holding as “a ‘narrow’ one” that did “not change all that much”\n    about the division of labor between district and bankruptcy courts.\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

Consent to adjudication by a bankruptcy court need not be ex-\n  press, but must be knowing and voluntary. Neither the Constitution\n  nor the relevant statute—which requires “the consent of all parties to\n  the proceeding” to hear a Stern claim, §157(c)(2)—mandates express\n  consent. Such a requirement would be in great tension with this\n  Court’s holding that substantially similar language in §636(c)—which\n  authorizes magistrate judges to conduct proceedings “[u]pon consent\n  of the parties”—permits waiver based on “actions rather than words,”\n  Roell v. Withrow, 538 U. S. 580, 589. Roell’s implied consent stand-\n  ard supplies the appropriate rule for bankruptcy court adjudications\n  and makes clear that a litigant’s consent—whether express or im-\n  plied—must be knowing and voluntary. Pp. 18–19.\n     3.

Because these protections help to ensure\nthe integrity and independence of the Judiciary, “we have\nlong recognized that, in general, Congress may not with-\ndraw from” the Article III courts “any matter which, from\nits nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in\nequity, or in admiralty.” Stern v.

In Northern Pipe-\nline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.

But it\ngave bankruptcy courts more limited author-ity in non-\ncore proceedings: They may “hear and determine” such\nproceedings, and “enter appropriate orders and judg-\nments,” only “with the consent of all the parties to the\nproceeding.” §157(c)(2).

Sharif repeatedly ignored Wellness’ discovery\nrequests and other litigation obligations, resulting in an\nentry of default judgment for Wellness. The District Court\neventually sanctioned Sharif by awarding Wellness over\n$650,000 in attorney’s fees. This case arises from Well-\nness’ long-running—and so far unsuccessful—efforts to\ncollect on that judgment.\n   In February 2009, Sharif filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nin the Northern District of Illinois. The bankruptcy peti-\ntion listed Wellness as a creditor. Wellness requested\ndocuments concerning Sharif ’s assets, which Sharif did\nnot provide. Wellness later obtained a loan application\nSharif had filed in 2002, listing more than $5 million in\nassets. When confronted, Sharif informed Wellness and\nthe Chapter 7 trustee that he had lied on the loan applica-\ntion. The listed assets, Sharif claimed, were actually\nowned by the Soad Wattar Living Trust (Trust), an entity\nSharif said he administered on behalf of his mother, and\nfor the benefit of his sister. Wellness pressed Sharif\nfor information on the Trust, but Sharif again failed to\nrespond.\n   Wellness filed a five-count adversary complaint against\nSharif in the Bankruptcy Court. See App. 5–22. Counts\nI–IV of the complaint objected to the discharge of Sharif ’s\ndebts because, among other reasons, Sharif had concealed\nproperty by claiming that it was owned by the Trust.\nCount V of the complaint sought a declaratory judgment\nthat the Trust was Sharif ’s alter ego and that its assets\nshould therefore be treated as part of Sharif ’s bankruptcy\nestate. Id., at 21. In his answer, Sharif admitted that the\nadversary proceeding was a “core proceeding” under 28\nU. S. C. §157(b)—i.e., a proceeding in which the Bankruptcy\nCourt could enter final judgment subject to appeal. See\n§§157(b)(1), (2)(J); App. 24. Indeed, Sharif requested\njudgment in his favor on all counts of Wellness’ complaint\n6        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand urged the Bankruptcy Court to “find that the Soad\nWattar Living Trust is not property of the [bankruptcy]\nestate.” Id., at 44.\n   A familiar pattern of discovery evasion ensued. Well-\nness responded by filing a motion for sanctions, or, in the\nalternative, to compel discovery. Granting the motion to\ncompel, the Bankruptcy Court warned Sharif that if he did\nnot respond to Wellness’ discovery requests a default\njudgment would be entered against him. Sharif eventu-\nally complied with some discovery obligations, but did not\nproduce any documents related to the Trust.\n   In July 2010, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling\nfinding that Sharif had violated the court’s discovery\norder. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 92a–120a. It accordingly\ndenied Sharif ’s request to discharge his debts and entered\na default judgment against him in the adversary proceed-\ning. And it declared, as requested by count V of Wellness’\ncomplaint, that the assets supposedly held by the Trust\nwere in fact property of Sharif ’s bankruptcy estate be-\ncause Sharif “treats [the Trust’s] assets as his own prop-\nerty.” Id., at 119a.\n   Sharif appealed to the District Court. Six weeks before\nSharif filed his opening brief in the District Court, this\nCourt decided Stern. In Stern, the Court held that Article\nIII prevents bankruptcy courts from entering final judg-\nment on claims that seek only to “augment” the bankruptcy\nestate and would otherwise “exis[t] without regard to\nany bankruptcy proceeding.” 564 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip\nop., at 27, 34). Sharif did not cite Stern in his opening\nbrief. Rather, after the close of briefing, Sharif moved for\nleave to file a supplemental brief, arguing that in light of\nIn re Ortiz, 665 F. 3d 906 (CA7 2011)—a recently issued\ndecision interpreting Stern—“the bankruptcy court’s order\nshould only be treated as a report and recommendation.”\nApp. 145.

The\nSeventh Circuit acknowledged that ordinarily Sharif ’s\nStern objection would “not [be] preserved because he\nwaited too long to assert it.” 727 F. 3d, at 767.5 But the\ncourt determined that the ordinary rule did not apply\nbecause Sharif ’s argument concerned “the allocation of\nauthority between bankruptcy courts and district courts”\nunder Article III, and thus “implicate[d] structural inter-\nests.” Id., at 771. Based on those separation-of-powers\nconsiderations, the court held that “a litigant may not\nwaive” a Stern objection. Id., at 773. Turning to the\nmerits of Sharif ’s contentions, the Seventh Circuit agreed\nwith the Bankruptcy Court’s resolution of counts I–IV of\nWellness’ adversary complaint. It further concluded,\nhowever, that count V of the complaint alleged a so-called\n“Stern claim,” that is, “a claim designated for final adjudi-\ncation in the bankruptcy court as a statutory matter, but\nprohibited from proceeding in that way as a constitutional\nmatter.” Executive Benefits, 573 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n4). The Seventh Circuit therefore ruled that the Bank-\nruptcy Court lacked constitutional authority to enter final\njudgment on count V.6\n——————\n   5 Although the Seventh Circuit referred to Sharif’s failure to raise his\n\nStern argument in a timely manner as a waiver, that court has since\nclarified that its decision rested on forfeiture. See Peterson v. Somers\nDublin Ltd., 729 F. 3d 741, 747 (2013) (“The issue in Wellness Interna-\ntional Network was forfeiture rather than waiver”).\n   6 The Seventh Circuit concluded its opinion by considering the rem-\n\nedy for the Bankruptcy Court’s purportedly unconstitutional issuance\nof a final judgment. The court determined that if count V of Wellness’\ncomplaint raised a core claim, the only statutorily authorized remedy\nwould be for the District Court to withdraw the reference to the Bank-\nruptcy Court and set a new discovery schedule.

The CFTC ruled against\nSchor on the counterclaims. This Court upheld that ruling\nagainst both statutory and constitutional challenges.\n  On the constitutional question (the one relevant here)\nthe Court began by holding that Schor had “waived any\nright he may have possessed to the full trial of [the bro-\nker’s] counterclaim before an Article III court.” Id., at 849.\nThe Court then explained why this waiver legitimated the\nCFTC’s exercise of authority: “[A]s a personal right, Arti-\ncle III’s guarantee of an impartial and independent federal\nadjudication is subject to waiver, just as are other per-\nsonal constitutional rights”—such as the right to a jury—\n“that dictate the procedures by which civil and criminal\nmatters must be tried.” Id., at 848–849.\n  The Court went on to state that a litigant’s waiver of his\n“personal right” to an Article III court is not always dis-\npositive because Article III “not only preserves to litigants\ntheir interest in an impartial and independent federal\nadjudication of claims . . . , but also serves as ‘an insepa-\nrable element of the constitutional system of checks and\nbalances.’ . . . To the extent that this structural principle\nis implicated in a given case”—but only to that extent—\n“the parties cannot by consent cure the constitutional\ndifficulty . . . .” Id., at 850–851.\n  Leaning heavily on the importance of Schor’s consent,\nthe Court found no structural concern implicated by the\nCFTC’s adjudication of the counterclaims against him.\nWhile “Congress gave the CFTC the authority to adjudi-\ncate such matters,” the Court wrote,\n10         WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v.

In such\n     circumstances, separation of powers concerns are di-\n     minished, for it seems self-evident that just as Con-\n     gress may encourage parties to settle a dispute out of\n     court or resort to arbitration without impermissible\n     incursions on the separation of powers, Congress may\n     make available a quasi-judicial mechanism through\n     which willing parties may, at their option, elect to re-\n     solve their differences.” Id., at 855.\nThe option for parties to submit their disputes to a non-\nArticle III adjudicator was at most a “de minimis” in-\nfringement on the prerogative of the federal courts. Id., at\n856.\n   A few years after Schor, the Court decided a pair of\ncases—Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858 (1989), and\nPeretz v. United States, 501 U. S. 923 (1991)—that reiter-\nated the importance of consent to the constitutional analy-\nsis. Both cases concerned whether the Federal Magis-\ntrates Act authorized magistrate judges to preside over\njury selection in a felony trial;8 the difference was that\nPeretz consented to the practice while Gomez did not.\nThat difference was dispositive.\n   In Gomez, the Court interpreted the statute as not\nallowing magistrate judges to supervise voir dire without\nconsent, emphasizing the constitutional concerns that\nmight otherwise arise. See 490 U. S., at 864. In Peretz,\nthe Court upheld the Magistrate Judge’s action, stating\nthat “the defendant’s consent significantly changes the\nconstitutional analysis.” 501 U. S., at 932.

S., at 848), and that “[t]he\nmost basic rights of criminal defendants are similarly\nsubject to waiver,” 501 U. S., at 936. And “[e]ven assum-\ning that a litigant may not waive structural protections\nprovided by Article III,” the Court found “no such struc-\ntural protections . . . implicated by” a magistrate judge’s\nsupervision of voir dire:\n     “Magistrates are appointed and subject to removal by\n     Article III judges. The ‘ultimate decision’ whether to\n     invoke the magistrate’s assistance is made by the dis-\n     trict court, subject to veto by the parties. The decision\n     whether to empanel the jury whose selection a magis-\n     trate has supervised also remains entirely with the\n     district court.

See post, at 16 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). Here\nagain, the principal dissent’s insistence on formalism leads it astray.\nAs we explained in Peretz, the “responsibility and importance [of]\npresiding over voir dire at a felony trial” is equivalent to the “supervi-\nsion of entire civil and misdemeanor trials,” 501 U. S., at 933, tasks in\nwhich magistrate judges may “order the entry of judgment” with the\nparties’ consent, §636(c)(1).\n12        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v.

Article III also serves a\nstructural purpose, “barring congressional attempts ‘to\ntransfer jurisdiction [to non-Article III tribunals] for the\npurpose of emasculating’ constitutional courts and thereby\nprevent[ing] ‘the encroachment or aggrandizement of one\nbranch at the expense of the other.’ ” Id., at 850 (citations\nomitted). But allowing Article I adjudicators to decide\nclaims submitted to them by consent does not offend the\nseparation of powers so long as Article III courts retain\nsupervisory authority over the process.\n                              B\n   The question here, then, is whether allowing bankruptcy\ncourts to decide Stern claims by consent would “imper-\nmissibly threate[n] the institutional integrity of the Judi-\ncial Branch.” Schor, 478 U. S., at 851. And that question\nmust be decided not by “formalistic and unbending rules,”\nbut “with an eye to the practical effect that the” practice\n“will have on the constitutionally assigned role of the\nfederal judiciary.” Ibid.; see Thomas v. Union Carbide\nAgricultural Products Co., 473 U. S. 568, 587 (1985)\n(“[P]ractical attention to substance rather than doctrinaire\nreliance on formal categories should inform application of\nArticle III”). The Court must weigh\n     “the extent to which the essential attributes of judicial\n     power are reserved to Article III courts, and, con-\n     versely, the extent to which the non-Article III forum exer-\n     cises the range of jurisdiction and powers normally\n     vested only in Article III courts, the origins and im-\n     portance of the right to be adjudicated, and the con-\n     cerns that drove Congress to depart from the re-\n     quirements of Article III.” Schor, 478 U.

Bankruptcy judges, like\nmagistrate judges, “are appointed and subject to removal\nby Article III judges,” Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937; see 28\nU. S. C. §§152(a)(1), (e). They “serve as judicial officers of\nthe United States district court,” §151, and collectively\n“constitute a unit of the district court” for that district,\n§152(a)(1). Just as “[t]he ‘ultimate decision’ whether to\ninvoke [a] magistrate [judge]’s assistance is made by the\ndistrict court,” Peretz, 501 U. S., at 937, bankruptcy courts\nhear matters solely on a district court’s reference, §157(a),\nwhich the district court may withdraw sua sponte or at the\nrequest of a party, §157(d). “[S]eparation of powers con-\ncerns are diminished” when, as here, “the decision to\ninvoke [a non-Article III] forum is left entirely to the\nparties and the power of the federal judiciary to take\njurisdiction” remains in place. Schor, 478 U. S., at 855.\n   Furthermore, like the CFTC in Schor, bankruptcy\ncourts possess no free-floating authority to decide claims\ntraditionally heard by Article III courts. Their ability to\nresolve such matters is limited to “a narrow class of com-\nmon law claims as an incident to the [bankruptcy courts’]\nprimary, and unchallenged, adjudicative function.” Id., at\n854. “In such circumstances, the magnitude of any intru-\nsion on the Judicial Branch can only be termed de mini-\nmis.” Id., at 856.\n   Finally, there is no indication that Congress gave bank-\nruptcy courts the ability to decide Stern claims in an effort\nto aggrandize itself or humble the Judiciary. As in Peretz,\n“[b]ecause ‘the entire process takes place under the district\ncourt’s total control and jurisdiction,’ there is no danger\nthat use of the [bankruptcy court] involves a ‘congres-\nsional attemp[t] “to transfer jurisdiction [to non-Article III\ntribunals] for the purpose of emasculating” constitutional\ncourts.’ ” 501 U.

Post, at 16. That argument misapprehends\nboth Schor and the nature of our analysis. What Schor forbids is using\nconsent to excuse an actual violation of Article III. See 478 U. S., at\n850–851 (“To the extent that th[e] structural principle [protected by\nArticle III] is implicated in a given case, the parties cannot by consent\ncure the constitutional difficulty . . .” (emphasis added)). But Schor\nconfirms that consent remains highly relevant when determining, as we\ndo here, whether a particular adjudication in fact raises constitutional\nconcerns. See id., at 855 (“separation of powers concerns are dimin-\nished” when “the decision to invoke [a non-Article III] forum is left\nentirely to the parties”). Thus, we do not rely on Sharif’s consent to\n“cur[e]” a violation of Article III. His consent shows, in part, why no\nsuch violation has occurred. Cf.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). In answer-\ning that question in the negative, both the plurality and\nthen-Justice Rehnquist, concurring in the judgment, noted\nthat the entity in question did not consent to the bank-\nruptcy court’s adjudication of the claim. See 458 U. S., at\n80, n. 31 (plurality opinion); id., at 91 (opinion of\nRehnquist, J.). The Court confirmed in two later cases\nthat Northern Pipeline turned on the lack of consent.

Because Stern was premised on non-\nconsent to adjudication by the Bankruptcy Court, the\n“constitutional bar” it announced, see post, at 14\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), simply does not govern the\nquestion whether litigants may validly consent to adjudi-\ncation by a bankruptcy court.\n   An expansive reading of Stern, moreover, would be\ninconsistent with the opinion’s own description of its\nholding. The Court in Stern took pains to note that the\nquestion before it was “a ‘narrow’ one,” and that its answer\ndid “not change all that much” about the division of labor\nbetween district courts and bankruptcy courts. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 37); see also id., at ___ (slip op., at 38) (stating\nthat Congress had exceeded the limitations of Article III\n“in one isolated respect”). That could not have been a fair\ncharacterization of the decision if it meant that bank-\nruptcy judges could no longer exercise their longstanding\nauthority to resolve claims submitted to them by consent.\nInterpreting Stern to bar consensual adjudications by\nbankruptcy courts would “meaningfully chang[e] the\ndivision of labor” in our judicial system, contra, id., at ___\n(slip op., at 37).11\n——————\n  11 Inadvancing its restrictive view of Stern, the principal dissent\nignores the sweeping jurisprudential implications of its position. If, as\nthe principal dissent suggests, consent is irrelevant to the Article III\nanalysis, it is difficult to see how Schor and Peretz were not wrongly\ndecided.

And a requirement of express consent\nwould be in great tension with our decision in Roell v.\nWithrow, 538 U. S. 580 (2003). That case concerned the\ninterpretation of §636(c), which authorizes magistrate\njudges to “conduct any or all proceedings in a jury or non-\njury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the\ncase,” with “the consent of the parties.”12 The specific\nquestion in Roell was whether, as a statutory matter, the\n“consent” required by §636(c) had to be express.

Applied in the bankruptcy context,\nthat standard possesses the same pragmatic virtues—\nincreasing judicial efficiency and checking gamesman-\nship—that motivated our adoption of it for consent-based\nadjudications by magistrate judges. See id., at 590. It\nbears emphasizing, however, that a litigant’s consent—\nwhether express or implied—must still be knowing and\nvoluntary. Roell makes clear that the key inquiry is\nwhether “the litigant or counsel was made aware of the\nneed for consent and the right to refuse it, and still volun-\ntarily appeared to try the case” before the non-Article III\nadjudicator. Ibid.; see also id., at 588, n. 5 (“notification of\nthe right to refuse” adjudication by a non-Article III court\n“is a prerequisite to any inference of consent”).13\n——————\n  13 Even though the Constitution does not require that consent be\n\nexpress, it is good practice for courts to seek express statements of\nconsent or nonconsent, both to ensure irrefutably that any waiver of the\nright to Article III adjudication is knowing and voluntary and to limit\nsubsequent litigation over the consent issue. Statutes or judicial rules\nmay require express consent where the Constitution does not. Indeed,\nthe Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure already require that\npleadings in adversary proceedings before a bankruptcy court “contain\na statement that the proceeding is core or non-core and, if non-core,\nthat the pleader does or does not consent to entry of final orders or\njudgment by the bankruptcy judge.” Fed.

Between the Revolution\nand the Constitutional Convention, state legislatures\nroutinely interfered with judgments of the courts. This\nhistory created the “sense of a sharp necessity to separate\nthe legislative from the judicial power.” Plaut, 514 U. S.,\nat 221; see Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U. S. ___,\n___–___ (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip\nop., at 5–8). The result was Article III, which established\na judiciary “truly distinct from both the legislature and\nthe executive.” The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter\ned. 1961) (A. Hamilton).\n   Article III vests the “judicial Power of the United\nStates” in “one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts\nas the Congress may from time to time ordain and estab­\nlish.” Art. III, §1. The judges of those courts are entitled\nto hold their offices “during good Behaviour” and to receive\ncompensation “which shall not be diminished” during their\ntenure. Ibid. The judicial power extends “to all Cases, in\nLaw and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws\nof the United States, and Treaties” and to other enumer­\nated matters. Art. III, §2. Taken together, these provi­\nsions define the constitutional birthright of Article III\njudges: to “render dispositive judgments” in cases or con­\ntroversies within the bounds of federal jurisdiction. Plaut,\n514 U. S., at 219 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   With narrow exceptions, Congress may not confer power\nto decide federal cases and controversies upon judges who\ndo not comply with the structural safeguards of Article III.\nThose narrow exceptions permit Congress to establish\nnon-Article III courts to exercise general jurisdiction in\nthe territories and the District of Columbia, to serve as\nmilitary tribunals, and to adjudicate disputes over “public\nrights” such as veterans’ benefits.

SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nrequirements of Article III for certain bankruptcy proceed­\nings. When the Framers gathered to draft the Constitu­\ntion, English statutes had long empowered nonjudicial\nbankruptcy “commissioners” to collect a debtor’s property,\nresolve claims by creditors, order the distribution of assets\nin the estate, and ultimately discharge the debts. See 2\nW. Blackstone, Commentaries *471–488. This historical\npractice, combined with Congress’s constitutional author-\nity to enact bankruptcy laws, confirms that Congress may\nassign to non-Article III courts adjudications involving\n“the restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is at\nthe core of the federal bankruptcy power.” Northern Pipe-\nline, 458 U. S., at 71 (plurality opinion).\n   Although Congress may assign some bankruptcy pro­\nceedings to non-Article III courts, there are limits on that\npower. In Northern Pipeline, the Court invalidated statu­\ntory provisions that permitted a bankruptcy court to enter\nfinal judgment on a creditor’s state law claim for breach of\ncontract. Because that claim arose not from the bankruptcy\nbut from independent common law sources, a majority\nof the Court determined that Article III required an adju­\ndicator with life tenure and salary protection. See id., at\n84; id., at 90–91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).\n   Congress responded to Northern Pipeline by allowing\nbankruptcy courts to render final judgments only in “core”\nbankruptcy proceedings. 28 U. S. C. §157(b). Those\njudgments may be appealed to district courts and re­\nviewed under deferential standards. §158(a). In non-core\nproceedings, bankruptcy judges may submit proposed\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, which the district\ncourt must review de novo before entering final judgment.\n§157(c)(1).\n   In Stern, we faced the question whether a bankruptcy\ncourt could enter final judgment on an action defined by\nCongress as a “core” proceeding—an estate’s counterclaim\nagainst a creditor based on state tort law. §157(b)(2)(C).\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

Like the contract claim in Northern Pipe-\nline, the tort claim in Stern involved “the stuff of the tradi­\ntional actions at common law tried by the courts at West­\nminster in 1789.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (quoting\nNorthern Pipeline, 458 U.

Congress had no power under the\nConstitution to assign the resolution of such a claim to a\njudge who lacked the structural protections of Article III.\n                              B\n  The question here is whether the claim Wellness sub­\nmitted to the Bankruptcy Court is a “Stern claim” that\nrequires final adjudication by an Article III court. See\nExecutive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison, 573 U. S. ___,\n___–___ (2014) (slip op., at 8–9) (assuming without decid­\ning that a fraudulent conveyance action is a “Stern claim”).\nAs the Court recounts, Wellness alleged that Sharif had\nconcealed about $5 million of assets by claiming that they\nwere owned by a trust. Wellness sought a declaratory\njudgment that the trust was in fact Sharif ’s alter ego and\nthat its assets should accordingly be part of his bankruptcy\nestate. The Bankruptcy Court granted final judgment\n(based on Sharif ’s default) to Wellness, declaring that the\ntrust assets were part of Sharif ’s estate because he had\ntreated them as his own property. Ante, at 5–6.\n  In my view, Article III likely poses no barrier to the\nBankruptcy Court’s resolution of Wellness’s claim. At its\nmost basic level, bankruptcy is “an adjudication of inter­\nests claimed in a res.” Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323,\n329 (1966) (internal quotation marks omitted). Wellness\nasked the Bankruptcy Court to declare that assets held by\nSharif are part of that res. Defining what constitutes the\n6        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nestate is the necessary starting point of every bankruptcy;\na court cannot divide up the estate without first knowing\nwhat’s in it. See 11 U. S. C. §541(a). As the Solicitor\nGeneral explains, “Identifying the property of the estate is\ntherefore inescapably central to the restructuring of the\ndebtor-creditor relationship.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 14.\n   Identifying property that constitutes the estate has long\nbeen a central feature of bankruptcy adjudication. Eng­\nlish bankruptcy commissioners had authority not only to\ncollect property in the debtor’s possession, but also to\n“cause any house or tenement of the bankrupt to be bro­\nken open,” in order to uncover and seize property the\ndebtor had concealed. 2 W.

America’s first bankruptcy statute, enacted by\nCongress in 1800, similarly gave commissioners “power to\ntake into their possession, all the estate, real and personal,\nof every nature and description to which the [debtor] may\nbe entitled, either in law or equity, in any manner whatso­\never.” §5, 2 Stat. 23. That is peculiarly a bankruptcy\npower.\n   The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 provides further support for\nWellness’s position. Under that Act, bankruptcy referees\nhad authority to exercise “summary” jurisdiction over\ncertain claims, while other claims could only be adjudi-\ncated in “plenary” proceedings before an Article III district\ncourt. See Arkison, 573 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 4–5).\nThis Court interpreted the 1898 Act to permit bankruptcy\nreferees to exercise summary jurisdiction to determine\nwhether property in the actual or constructive possession\nof a debtor should come within the estate, at least when no\nthird party asserted more than a “merely colorable” claim\nto the property. Mueller v. Nugent, 184 U. S. 1, 15 (1902).\nIn the legal parlance of the times, a “merely colorable”\nclaim was one that existed “in appearance only, and not in\nreality.” Black’s Law Dictionary 223 (1891). So a bank­\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nruptcy referee could exercise summary jurisdiction over\nproperty in the debtor’s possession as long as no third\nparty asserted a “substantial adverse” claim. Taubel-\nScott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, 264 U. S. 426, 431–433 (1924).\n   Here, Sharif does not contest that he held legal title to\nthe assets in the trust. Assuming that no third party\nasserted a substantial adverse claim to those assets—an\ninquiry for the Bankruptcy Court on remand—Wellness’s\nalter ego claim fits comfortably into the category of cases\nthat bankruptcy referees could have decided by them­\nselves under the 1898 Act.\n   In Mueller, for example, this Court held that a bank­\nruptcy referee could exercise summary jurisdiction over\nproperty in the possession of a third party acting as the\ndebtor’s agent. 184 U. S., at 14–17; see Black’s Law Dic­\ntionary 302 (10th ed. 2014) (example of a merely “color­\nable” claim is “one made by a person holding property as an\nagent or bailee of the bankrupt”). Similarly, this Court\nheld that a bankruptcy referee could exercise summary\njurisdiction over a creditor’s claim that the debtor had\nconcealed assets under the veil of a corporate entity that\nwas “nothing but a sham and a cloak.” Sampsell v. Impe-\nrial Paper & Color Corp., 313 U. S. 215, 216–217 (1941)\n(internal quotation marks omitted), rev’g 114 F. 2d 49, 52\n(CA9 1940) (describing creditor’s claim that corporation\nwas debtor’s “alter ego”). As the Court explained in\nSampsell, the “legal existence of the affiliated corporation”\ndid not automatically require a plenary proceeding, be­\ncause “[m]ere legal paraphernalia will not suffice to trans­\nform into a substantial adverse claimant a corporation\nwhose affairs are so closely assimilated to the affairs of the\ndominant stockholder that in substance it is little more\nthan his corporate pocket.” 313 U. S., at 218. Just as the\nbankruptcy referee in that case had authority to decide\nwhether assets allegedly concealed behind the corporate\nveil belonged to the bankruptcy estate, the Bankruptcy\n8        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nCourt here had authority to decide whether the assets\nallegedly concealed in the trust belonged to Sharif ’s\nestate.\n   Sharif contends that Wellness’s alter ego claim is more\nlike an allegation of a fraudulent conveyance, which this\nCourt has implied must be adjudicated by an Article III\ncourt. See Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33,\n56 (1989); Arkison, 573 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 8–9).\nAlthough both actions aim to remedy a debtor’s deception,\nthey differ in a critical respect. A fraudulent conveyance\nclaim seeks assets in the hands of a third party, while an\nalter ego claim targets only the debtor’s “second self.”\nWebster’s New International Dictionary 76 (2d ed. 1954).\nThat distinction is significant given bankruptcy’s historic\ndomain over property within the actual or constructive\n“possession [of] the bankrupt at the time of the filing of\nthe petition.” Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 309\nU. S. 478, 481 (1940). Through a fraudulent conveyance, a\ndishonest debtor relinquishes possession of assets before\nfiling for bankruptcy. Reclaiming those assets for the\nestate requires depriving third parties of property within\ntheir otherwise lawful possession and control, an action\nthat “quintessentially” required a suit at common law.\nGranfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 56. By contrast, a debtor’s\npossession of property provided “an adequate basis” for a\nbankruptcy referee to adjudicate a dispute over title in a\nsummary proceeding. Thompson, 309 U. S., at 482; see\nMueller, 184 U. S., at 15–16 (distinguishing claim to prop­\nerty in possession of debtor’s agent from fraudulent con­\nveyance claim in determining that bankruptcy referee\ncould exercise summary jurisdiction).\n   In sum, unlike the fraudulent conveyance claim in\nGranfinanciera, Wellness’s alter ego claim alleges that\nassets within Sharif ’s actual or constructive possession\nbelong to his estate. And unlike the breach of contract\nand tort claims at issue in Northern Pipeline and Stern,\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nWellness’s claim stems not from any independent source of\nlaw but “from the bankruptcy itself.” Stern, 564 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 34). Provided that no third party asserted\na substantial adverse claim to the trust assets, Wellness’s\nclaim therefore falls within the narrow historical excep­\ntion that permits a non-Article III adjudicator in certain\nbankruptcy proceedings. I would reverse the contrary\nholding by the Court of Appeals and end our inquiry there,\nrather than deciding a broader question that may not be\nnecessary to the disposition of this case.\n                              II\n   The Court “expresses no view” on whether Wellness’s\nclaim was a Stern claim. Ante, at 8, n. 7. Instead, the\nCourt concludes that the Bankruptcy Court had constitu­\ntional authority to enter final judgment on Wellness’s\nclaim either way. The majority rests its decision on Sha­\nrif ’s purported consent to the Bankruptcy Court’s adjudi­\ncation. But Sharif has no authority to compromise the\nstructural separation of powers or agree to an exercise of\njudicial power outside Article III. His consent therefore\ncannot cure a constitutional violation.\n                              A\n   “[I]f there is a principle in our Constitution . . . more\nsacred than another,” James Madison said on the floor of\nthe First Congress, “it is that which separates the Legisla­\ntive, Executive, and Judicial powers.” 1 Annals of Cong.\n581 (1789). A strong word, “sacred.” Madison was the\nprincipal drafter of the Constitution, and he knew what he\nwas talking about. By diffusing federal powers among\nthree different branches, and by protecting each branch\nagainst incursions from the others, the Framers devised a\nstructure of government that promotes both liberty and\naccountability. See Bond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___,\n___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 10–11); Free Enterprise Fund v.\n10       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S.\n477, 497–501 (2010) (PCAOB); Youngstown Sheet & Tube\nCo. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J.,\nconcurring).\n   Preserving the separation of powers is one of this\nCourt’s most weighty responsibilities. In performing that\nduty, we have not hesitated to enforce the Constitution’s\nmandate “that one branch of the Government may not\nintrude upon the central prerogatives of another.” Loving\nv. United States, 517 U. S. 748, 757 (1996). We have\naccordingly invalidated executive actions that encroach\nupon the power of the Legislature, see NLRB v. Noel\nCanning, 573 U. S. ___ (2014); Youngstown, 343 U. S. 579;\nlegislative actions that invade the province of the Execu­\ntive, see PCAOB, 561 U. S. 477; Bowsher v. Synar, 478\nU. S. 714 (1986); Chadha, 462 U. S. 919; Myers v. United\nStates, 272 U. S. 52 (1926); and actions by either branch\nthat trench upon the territory of the Judiciary, see Stern,\n564 U. S. ___; Plaut, 514 U. S. 211; United States v. Will,\n449 U. S. 200 (1980); United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128\n(1872); Hayburn’s Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792).\n   In these and other cases, we have emphasized that the\nvalues of liberty and accountability protected by the sepa­\nration of powers belong not to any branch of the Govern­\nment but to the Nation as a whole. See Bowsher, 478\nU. S., at 722. A branch’s consent to a diminution of its\nconstitutional powers therefore does not mitigate the\nharm or cure the wrong. “Liberty is always at stake when\none or more of the branches seek to transgress the separa­\ntion of powers.” Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S.\n417, 450 (1998) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). When the\nExecutive and the Legislature agreed to bypass the Article\nI, §7, requirements of bicameralism and presentment by\ncreating a Presidential line-item veto—a very pragmatic\nproposal—the Court held that the arrangement violated\nthe Constitution notwithstanding the voluntary participa­\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

Id., at 421 (majority opinion).\nLikewise, the Court struck down a one-House “legislative\nveto” that violated Article I, §7, even though Presidents\nand Congresses had agreed to include similar provisions in\nhundreds of laws for more than 50 years. Chadha, 462\nU. S., at 944–945.\n   In neither of these cases did the branches’ willing em­\nbrace of a separation of powers violation weaken the\nCourt’s scrutiny. To the contrary, the branches’ “enthusi­\nasm” for the offending arrangements “ ‘sharpened rather\nthan blunted’ our review.” Noel Canning, 573 U. S., at ___\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 4) (quot­\ning Chadha, 462 U. S, at 944). In short, because the\nstructural provisions of the Constitution protect liberty\nand not just government entities, “the separation of pow­\ners does not depend on . . . whether ‘the encroached-upon\nbranch approves the encroachment.’ ” PCAOB, 561 U. S.,\nat 497 (quoting New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,\n182 (1992)).\n                               B\n   If a branch of the Federal Government may not consent\nto a violation of the separation of powers, surely a private\nlitigant may not do so. Just as a branch of Government\nmay not consent away the individual liberty interest\nprotected by the separation of powers, so too an individual\nmay not consent away the institutional interest protected\nby the separation of powers. To be sure, a private litigant\nmay consensually relinquish individual constitutional\nrights. A federal criminal defendant, for example, may\nknowingly and voluntarily waive his Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial by pleading guilty to a charged offense.\nSee Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). But\nthat same defendant may not agree to stand trial on fed­\neral charges before a state court, a foreign court, or a moot\ncourt, because those courts have no constitutional author­\n12       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nity to exercise judicial power over his case, and he has no\npower to confer it. A “lack of federal jurisdiction cannot be\nwaived or be overcome by an agreement of the parties.”\nMitchell v. Maurer, 293 U. S. 237, 244 (1934).\n   As the majority recognizes, the Court’s most extensive\ndiscussion of litigant consent in a separation of powers\ncase occurred in Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v.\nSchor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986). There the Court held that\nArticle III confers both a “personal right” that can be\nwaived through consent and a structural component that\n“safeguards the role of the Judicial Branch in our tripar­\ntite system.” Id., at 848, 850. “To the extent that this\nstructural principle is implicated in a given case, the\nparties cannot by consent cure the constitutional difficulty\nfor the same reason that the parties by consent cannot\nconfer on federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction beyond\nthe limitations imposed by Article III.” Id., at 850–851.\nThus, when “Article III limitations are at issue, notions of\nconsent and waiver cannot be dispositive because the\nlimitations serve institutional interests that the parties\ncannot be expected to protect.” Id., at 851.\n   Schor’s holding that a private litigant can consent to an\nArticle III violation that affects only his “personal right”\nhas been vigorously contested. See id., at 867 (Brennan,\nJ., dissenting) (“Because the individual and structural\ninterests served by Article III are coextensive, I do not\nbelieve that a litigant may ever waive his right to an\nArticle III tribunal where one is constitutionally re­\nquired”); Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 70 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). But\nwhatever the merits of that position, nobody disputes that\nSchor forbids a litigant from consenting to a constitutional\nviolation when the structural component of Article III “is\nimplicated.” 478 U. S., at 850–851. Thus, the key inquiry\nin this case—as the majority puts it—is “whether allowing\nbankruptcy courts to decide Stern claims by consent would\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n‘impermissibly threaten the institutional integrity of the\nJudicial Branch.’ ” Ante, at 12 (quoting Schor, 478 U. S.,\nat 851; alteration omitted).\n   One need not search far to find the answer. In Stern,\nthis Court applied the analysis from Schor to bankruptcy\ncourts and concluded that they lack Article III authority to\nenter final judgments on matters now known as Stern\nclaims. The Court noted that bankruptcy courts, unlike\nthe administrative agency in Schor, were endowed by\nCongress with “substantive jurisdiction reaching any area\nof the corpus juris,” power to render final judgments en­\nforceable without any action by Article III courts, and\nauthority to adjudicate counterclaims entirely independ­\nent of the bankruptcy itself. 564 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op.,\nat 25–29). The Court concluded that allowing Congress to\nbestow such authority on non-Article III courts would\n“compromise the integrity of the system of separated\npowers and the role of the Judiciary in that system.” Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 38). If there was any room for doubt\nabout the basis for its holding, the Court dispelled it by\nasking a question: “Is there really a threat to the separa­\ntion of powers where Congress has conferred the judicial\npower outside Article III only over certain counterclaims\nin bankruptcy?” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 37). “The short but\nemphatic answer is yes.” Ibid.\n   In other words, allowing bankruptcy courts to decide\nStern claims by consent would “impermissibly threaten\nthe institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch.” Ante, at\n12 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). It is\nlittle wonder that the Court of Appeals felt itself bound by\nStern and Schor to hold that Sharif ’s consent could not\ncure the Stern violation. 727 F. 3d 751, 771 (CA7 2013).\nOther Courts of Appeals have adopted the same reading.\nSee In re BP RE, L. P., 735 F. 3d 279, 287 (CA5 2013);\nWaldman v. Stone, 698 F. 3d 910, 917–918 (CA6 2012).\n   The majority attempts to avoid this conclusion through\n14       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nan imaginative reconstruction of Stern. As the majority\nsees it, Stern “turned on the fact that the litigant ‘did not\ntruly consent to’ resolution of the claim” against him in\nthe Bankruptcy Court. Ante, at 15 (quoting 564 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 27)). That is not a proper reading of the\ndecision. The constitutional analysis in Stern, spanning\n22 pages, contained exactly one affirmative reference to\nthe lack of consent. See ibid. That reference came amid a\nlong list of factors distinguishing the proceeding in Stern\nfrom the proceedings in Schor and other “public rights”\ncases. 564 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 27–29). Stern’s\nsubsequent sentences made clear that the notions of con­\nsent relied upon by the Court in Schor did not apply in\nbankruptcy because “creditors lack an alternative forum to\nthe bankruptcy court in which to pursue their claims.”\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 28) (quoting Granfinanciera,\n492 U. S., at 59, n. 14). Put simply, the litigant in Stern\ndid not consent because he could not consent given the\nnature of bankruptcy.\n  There was an opinion in Stern that turned heavily on\nconsent: the dissent. 564 U. S., at ___–___ (opinion of\nBREYER, J.) (slip op., at 12–14). The Stern majority re­\nsponded to the dissent with a counterfactual: Even if\nconsent were relevant to the analysis, that factor would\nnot change the result because the litigant did not truly\nconsent. Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 28–29). Moreover,\nStern held that “it does not matter who” authorizes a\nbankruptcy judge to render final judgments on Stern\nclaims, because the “constitutional bar remains.” Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 36). That holding is incompatible with the\nmajority’s conclusion today that two litigants can author­\nize a bankruptcy judge to render final judgments on Stern\nclaims, despite the constitutional bar that remains.\n  The majority also relies heavily on the supervision and\ncontrol that Article III courts exercise over bankruptcy\ncourts. Ante, at 12–15. As the majority notes, court of\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            15\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nappeals judges appoint bankruptcy judges, and bankruptcy\njudges receive cases only on referral from district courts\n(although every district court in the country has adopted a\nstanding rule automatically referring all bankruptcy\nfilings to bankruptcy judges, see 1 Collier on Bankruptcy\n¶3.02[1], p. 3–26 (16th ed. 2014)). The problem is that\nCongress has also given bankruptcy courts authority to\nenter final judgments subject only to deferential appellate\nreview, and Article III precludes those judgments when\nthey involve Stern claims. The fact that Article III judges\nplayed a role in the Article III violation does not remedy\nthe constitutional harm. We have already explained why.\n   It is a fundamental principle that no branch of govern­\nment can delegate its constitutional functions to an actor\nwho lacks authority to exercise those functions. See\nWhitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457,\n472 (2001); Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 311\n(1936). Such delegations threaten liberty and thwart\naccountability by empowering entities that lack the struc­\ntural protections the Framers carefully devised. See\nDepartment of Transportation v. Association of American\nRailroads, 575 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015) (ALITO, J., con­\ncurring) (slip op., at 6–7); id., at ___–___ (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2–3); Mistretta v.\nUnited States, 488 U. S. 361, 417–422 (1989) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting). Article III judges have no constitutional\nauthority to delegate the judicial power—the power to\n“render dispositive judgments”—to non-Article III judges,\nno matter how closely they control or supervise their\nwork. Plaut, 514 U. S., at 219 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   In any event, the majority’s arguments about supervi­\nsion and control are not new. They were considered and\nrejected in Stern. See 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 36) (“it\ndoes not matter who appointed the bankruptcy judge or\nauthorized the judge to render final judgments”); see also\n16       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nNorthern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 84–86 (plurality opinion);\nid., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). The\nmajority points to no differences between the bankruptcy\nproceeding in Stern and the bankruptcy proceeding here,\nexcept for Sharif ’s purported consent. The majority thus\ntreats consent as “dispositive” in curing the structural\nseparation of powers violation—precisely what Schor said\nconsent could not do. 478 U. S., at 851.\n                               C\n   Eager to change the subject from Stern, the majority\ndevotes considerable attention to defending the authority\nof magistrate judges, who may conduct certain proceed­\nings with the consent of the parties under 28 U. S. C.\n§636. No one here challenges the constitutionality of\nmagistrate judges or disputes that they, like bankruptcy\njudges, may issue reports and recommendations that are\nreviewed de novo by Article III judges. The cases about\nmagistrate judges cited by the majority therefore have\nlittle bearing on this case, because none of them involved a\nconstitutional challenge to the entry of final judgment by a\nnon-Article III actor. See Roell v. Withrow, 538 U. S. 580\n(2003) (statutory challenge only); Peretz v. United States,\n501 U. S. 923 (1991) (challenge to a magistrate judge’s\nconduct of voir dire in a felony trial); Gomez v. United\nStates, 490 U. S. 858 (1989) (same).\n   The majority also points to 19th-century cases in which\ncourts referred disputes to non-Article III referees, mas­\nters, or arbitrators. Ante, at 8. In those cases, however, it\nwas the Article III court that ultimately entered final\njudgment. E.g., Thornton v. Carson, 7 Cranch 596, 600\n(1813) (“the Court was right in entering the judgment for\nthe sums awarded”). Article III courts do refer matters to\nnon-Article III actors for assistance from time to time.\nThis Court does so regularly in original jurisdiction cases.\nSee, e.g., Kansas v. Nebraska, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n(slip op., at 1). But under the Constitution, the “ultimate\nresponsibility for deciding” the case must remain with the\nArticle III court. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Colo-\nrado v. New Mexico, 467 U. S. 310, 317 (1984)).\n   The concurrence’s comparison of bankruptcy judges to\narbitrators is similarly inapt. Ante, at 1 (opinion of ALITO,\nJ.). Arbitration is “a matter of contract” by which parties\nagree to resolve their disputes in a private forum. Rent-A-\nCenter, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. 63, 67 (2010).\nSuch an arrangement does not implicate Article III any\nmore than does an agreement between two business part­\nners to submit a difference of opinion to a mutually trusted\nfriend. Arbitration agreements, like most private con­\ntracts, can be enforced in court. And Congress, pursuant\nto its Commerce Clause power, has authorized district\ncourts to enter judgments enforcing arbitration awards\nunder certain circumstances. See 9 U. S. C. §9. But this\nordinary scheme of contract enforcement creates no consti­\ntutional concern. As the concurrence acknowledges, only\nArticle III judges—not arbitrators—may enter final judg­\nments enforcing arbitration awards. Ante, at 1.\n   The discussion of magistrate judges, masters, arbitra­\ntors, and the like fits with the majority’s focus on the\nsupposedly dire consequences that would follow a decision\nthat parties cannot consent to the final adjudication of\nStern claims in bankruptcy courts. Of course, it “goes\nwithout saying” that practical considerations of efficiency\nand convenience cannot trump the structural protections\nof the Constitution. Stern, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n36); see Perez, 575 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment) (slip op., at 20) (“Even in the face of perceived\nnecessity, the Constitution protects us from ourselves.”).\nAnd I find it hard to believe that the Framers in Philadel­\nphia, who took great care to ensure that the Judiciary was\n“truly distinct” from the Legislature, would have been\ncomforted to know that Congress’s incursion here could\n18       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n“only be termed de minimis.” Ante, at 13 (quoting Schor,\n478 U. S., at 856).\n   In any event, the majority overstates the consequences\nof enforcing the requirements of Article III in this case. As\nexplained in Part I, Wellness’s claim may not be a Stern\nclaim, in which case the bankruptcy statute would apply\nprecisely as Congress wrote it. Even if Wellness’s claim\nwere a Stern claim, the District Court would not need to\nstart from scratch. As this Court held in Arkison, the\nDistrict Court could treat the bankruptcy judge’s decision\nas a recommendation and enter judgment after performing\nde novo review. 573 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n   In Stern, the Court cautioned that Congress “may no\nmore lawfully chip away at the authority of the Judicial\nBranch than it may eliminate it entirely.” 564 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 37). The majority sees no reason to fret,\nhowever, so long as two private parties consent. Ante, at\n14, n. 10. But such parties are unlikely to carefully weigh\nthe long-term structural independence of the Article III\njudiciary against their own short-term priorities. Perhaps\nthe majority’s acquiescence in this diminution of constitu­\ntional authority will escape notice. Far more likely, how­\never, it will amount to the kind of “blueprint for extensive\nexpansion of the legislative power” that we have resisted\nin the past. PCAOB, 561 U. S., at 500 (quoting Metropoli-\ntan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for Abate-\nment of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 277 (1991)).\n   The encroachment at issue here may seem benign\nenough. Bankruptcy judges are devoted professionals who\nstrive to be fair to all sides, and litigants can be trusted to\nprotect their own interests when deciding whether to\nconsent. But the fact remains that Congress controls the\nsalary and tenure of bankruptcy judges, and the Legisla­\nture’s present solicitude provides no guarantee of its fu­\nture restraint. See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530,\n534 (1962) (plurality opinion). Once Congress knows that\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nit can assign federal claims to judges outside Article III\nwith the parties’ consent, nothing would limit its exercise\nof that power to bankruptcy. Congress may consider it\nadvantageous to allow claims to be heard before judges\nsubject to greater legislative control in any number of\nareas of federal concern. As for the requirement of con­\nsent, Congress can find ways to “encourage” consent, say\nby requiring it as a condition of federal benefits. That has\nworked to expand Congress’s power before. See, e.g.,\nCollege Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary\nEd. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999) (“Congress\nmay, in the exercise of its spending power, condition its\ngrant of funds to the States upon their taking certain\nactions that Congress could not require them to take”);\nSouth Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 207 (1987) (same).\n   Legislative designs of this kind would not displace the\nArticle III judiciary overnight. But steady erosion of\nArticle III authority, no less than a brazen usurpation,\nviolates the constitutional separation of powers. In a\nFederal Government of limited powers, one branch’s loss is\nanother branch’s gain, see PCAOB, 561 U. S., at 500, so\nwhether a branch aims to “arrogate power to itself ” or to\n“impair another in the performance of its constitutional\nduties,” the Constitution forbids the transgression all the\nsame. Loving, 517 U. S., at 757. As we have cautioned,\n“[s]light encroachments create new boundaries from which\nlegions of power can seek new territory to capture.” Stern,\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 38) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   The Framers understood this danger. They warned that\nthe Legislature would inevitably seek to draw greater\npower into its “impetuous vortex,” The Federalist No. 48,\nat 309 (J. Madison), and that “power over a man’s subsist­\nence amounts to a power over his will,” id., No. 79, at 472\n(A. Hamilton) (emphasis deleted). In response, the Fram­\ners adopted the structural protections of Article III, “es­\n20       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntablishing high walls and clear distinctions because low\nwalls and vague distinctions will not be judicially defensi­\nble in the heat of interbranch conflict.” Plaut, 514 U. S., at\n239. As this Court once put it, invoking Frost, “Good\nfences make good neighbors.” Id., at 240.\n  Ultimately, however, the structural protections of Arti­\ncle III are only as strong as this Court’s will to enforce\nthem. In Madison’s words, the “great security against a\ngradual concentration of the several powers in the same\ndepartment consists in giving to those who administer\neach department the necessary constitutional means and\npersonal motives to resist encroachments of the others.”\nThe Federalist No. 51, at 321–322 (J. Madison). The\nCourt today declines to resist encroachment by the Legis­\nlature. Instead it holds that a single federal judge, for\nreasons adequate to him, may assign away our hard-won\nconstitutional birthright so long as two private parties\nagree. I hope I will be wrong about the consequences of\nthis decision for the independence of the Judicial Branch.\nBut for now, another literary passage comes to mind: It\nprofits the Court nothing to give its soul for the whole\nworld . . . but to avoid Stern claims?\n  I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

See Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___ (2011). I write\nseparately to highlight a few questions touching on the\nconsent issue that merit closer attention than either the\nCourt or THE CHIEF JUSTICE gives them.\n  I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that individuals cannot\nconsent to violations of the Constitution, but this principle\nhas nothing to do with whose interest the violated provi-\nsion protects. Anytime the Federal Government acts in a\nmanner inconsistent with the separation of powers, it acts\nin excess of its constitutional authority. That authority is\ncarefully defined by the Constitution, and, except through\nArticle V’s amendment process, that document does not\npermit individuals to bestow additional power upon the\nGovernment.\n  The majority today authorizes non-Article III courts to\nadjudicate, with consent, claims that we have held to\nrequire an exercise of the judicial power based on its as-\nsessment that few “structural interests” are implicated by\nconsent to the adjudication of Stern claims. See ante, at 7,\n12. That reasoning is flawed. It matters not whether we\nthink the particular violation threatens the structure of\n2        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nour Government. Our duty is to enforce the Constitution\nas written, not as revised by private consent, innocuous or\notherwise. Worse, amidst the tempest over whether\n“structural interests” are implicated when an individual\nconsents to adjudication of Stern claims by a non-Article\nIII court, both the majority and THE CHIEF JUSTICE fail to\ngrapple with the antecedent question: whether a violation\nof the Constitution has actually occurred. That question is\na difficult one, and the majority makes a grave mistake by\nskipping over it in its quest to answer the question whether\nconsent can authorize a constitutional violation. Because\nI would resolve this case on narrower grounds, I need not\ndecide that question here. I nevertheless write separately\nto highlight the complexity of the issues the majority\nsimply brushes past.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   “The principle, that [the Federal Government] can\nexercise only the powers granted to it, . . . is now univer-\nsally admitted.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316,\n405 (1819). A corollary to this principle is that each\nbranch of the Government is limited to the exercise of\nthose powers granted to it. Every violation of the separa-\ntion of powers thus involves an exercise of power in excess\nof the Constitution. And because the only authorities\ncapable of granting power are the Constitution itself, and\nthe people acting through the amendment process, indi-\nvidual consent cannot authorize the Government to exceed\nconstitutional boundaries.\n   This does not mean, however, that consent is invariably\nirrelevant to the constitutional inquiry. Although it may\nnot authorize a constitutional violation, consent may\nprevent one from occurring in the first place. This concept\nis perhaps best understood with the example on which the\nmajority and THE CHIEF JUSTICE both rely: the right to a\n                      Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                     3\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\njury trial. Ante, at 9 (majority opinion); ante, at 11\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting).1 Although the Government\nincurably contravenes the Constitution when it acts in\nviolation of the jury trial right, our precedents permit the\nGovernment to convict a criminal defendant without a\njury trial when he waives that right. See Brady v. United\nStates, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). The defendant’s waiver\nis thus a form of consent that lifts a limitation on govern-\nment action by satisfying its terms—that is, the right is\nexercised and honored, not disregarded. See Patton v.\nUnited States, 281 U. S. 276, 296–298 (1930), abrogated on\nother grounds by Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78 (1970).\nProvided the Government otherwise acts within its pow-\ners, there is no constitutional violation.\n                              B\n  Consent to the adjudication of Stern claims by bank-\nruptcy courts is a far more complex matter than waiver of\na jury trial. Two potential violations of the separation of\npowers occur whenever bankruptcy courts adjudicate\nStern claims. First, the bankruptcy courts purport to\nexercise power that the Constitution vests exclusively in\nthe judiciary, even though they are not Article III courts\nbecause bankruptcy judges do not enjoy the tenure and\nsalary protections required by Article III. See Art. III, §1.\nSecond, the bankruptcy courts act pursuant to statutory\nauthorization that is itself invalid. For even when acting\npursuant to an enumerated power, such as the bankruptcy\n\n——————\n  1 There is some dispute whether the guarantee of a jury trial protects\nan individual right, a structural right, or both, raising serious questions\nabout how it should be treated under Commodity Futures Trading\nComm’n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986). My view, which does not turn\non such taxonomies, leaves no doubt: It is a “fundamental reservation\nof power in our constitutional structure,” Blakely v. Washington, 542\nU. S. 296, 306 (2004), meaning its violation may not be authorized by\nthe consent of the individual.\n4        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npower, Congress exceeds its authority when it purports to\nauthorize a person or entity to perform a function that\nrequires the exercise of a power vested elsewhere by the\nConstitution. See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns.,\nInc., 531 U. S. 457, 472 (2001).\n   Rather than attempt to grapple with these problems,\nthe majority seizes on some statements from Commodity\nFutures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986), to\nresolve the difficult constitutional issue before us. See\nante, at 9–12. But to the extent Schor suggests that indi-\nvidual consent could authorize non-Article III courts to\nexercise the judicial power, 478 U. S., at 850–851, it was\nwrongly decided and should be abandoned. Consent to\nadjudication by non-Article III judges may waive whatever\nindividual right to impartial adjudication Article III im-\nplies, thereby lifting that affirmative barrier on Govern-\nment action. But non-Article III courts must still act\nwithin the bounds of their constitutional authority. That\nis, they must act through a power properly delegated to\nthe Federal Government and not vested by the Constitu-\ntion in a different governmental actor. Because the judi-\ncial power is vested exclusively in Article III courts, non-\nArticle III courts may not exercise it.\n   Schor’s justification for authorizing such a transgression\nwas that it judged the “practical effect [the allocation\nwould] have on the constitutionally assigned role of the\nfederal judiciary” not to be too great. Id., at 851. But we\n“can[not] preserve a system of separation of powers on the\nbasis of such intuitive judgments regarding ‘practical\neffects.’ ” Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33,\n70 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). Put more starkly, “[t]o uphold” a violation of\nthe Constitution because one perceives “the infraction\nassailed [a]s unimportant when compared with similar but\nmore serious infractions which might be conceived . . . is\nnot to interpret that instrument, but to disregard it.”\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

Our Constitution is not a matter of\nconvenience, to be invoked when we feel uncomfortable\nwith some Government action and cast aside when we do\nnot. See Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., ante, at 5\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n                              II\n  Properly understood, then, the answer to the consent\nquestion in this case depends on whether bankruptcy\ncourts act within the bounds of their constitutional au-\nthority when they adjudicate Stern claims with the con-\nsent of the parties. In order to answer that question, we\nmust consider what form of governmental power that type\nof adjudication requires and whether bankruptcy courts\nare qualified to exercise that power. Department of\nTransportation v. Association of American Railroads, ante,\nat 24 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n  Many Government functions “may be performed by two\nor more branches without either exceeding its enumerated\npowers under the Constitution.” Ante, at 4. Certain core\nfunctions, however, demand the exercise of legislative,\nexecutive, or judicial power, and their allocation is con-\ntrolled by the Vesting Clauses contained in the first three\narticles of the Constitution. Ibid. We have already held\nthat adjudicating Stern claims, at least without consent of\nthe parties, requires an exercise of the judicial power\nvested exclusively in Article III courts. Stern, 564 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 28–29). The difficult question pre-\nsented by this case, which the Court glosses over, is\nwhether the parties’ consent somehow transforms the\nnature of the power exercised.\n                         A\n  As the concepts were understood at the time of the\n6        WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfounding, the legislative, executive, and judicial powers\nplayed different roles in the resolution of cases and con-\ntroversies. In this context, the judicial power is the power\n“to determine all differences according to the established\nlaw”; the legislative power is the power to make that\n“established law”; and the executive power is the power “to\nback and support the sentence, and to give it due execu-\ntion.” J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government\n§§124–126, pp. 62–63 (J. Gough ed. 1947) (Locke); see also\nWayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 46 (1825).\n   It should be immediately apparent that consent does not\ntransform the adjudication of Stern claims into a function\nthat requires the exercise of legislative or executive power.\nParties by their consent do not transform the function of\nadjudicating controversies into the functions of creating\nrules or enforcing judgments.\n   The more difficult question is whether consent somehow\neliminates the need for an exercise of the judicial power.\nOur precedents reveal that the resolution of certain cases\nor controversies requires the exercise of that power, but\nthat others “may or may not” be brought “within the cog-\nnizance of [Article III courts], as [Congress] deem[s] proper.”\nMurray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18\nHow. 272, 284 (1856). The distinction generally has to\ndo with the types of rights at issue. Disposition of private\nrights to life, liberty, and property falls within the core of\nthe judicial power, whereas disposition of public rights\ndoes not. From that core of the judicial power, we have\nidentified two narrow historical exceptions. Those excep-\ntions, along with the treatment of cases or controversies\nnot falling within that core, provide useful guidance for\nunderstanding whether bankruptcy courts’ adjudication of\nStern claims with the consent of the parties requires the\nexercise of Article III judicial power.\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

Northern Pipeline\nConstr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 63–67\n(1982) (plurality opinion).\n  The first two represent unique historical exceptions that\ntell us little about the overall scope of the judicial power.\nFrom an early date, this Court has long upheld laws au-\nthorizing the adjudication of cases arising in the territo-\nries in non-Article III “territorial courts” on the ground\nthat such courts exercise power “conferred by Congress, in\nthe execution of those general powers which [Congress]\npossesses over the territories of the United States.” Amer-\nican Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 1 Pet. 511, 546 (1828)\n(Canter).2 And the Court has upheld laws authorizing the\n——————\n  2 Chief Justice Marshall’s explanation in Canter has come under at-\n\ntack on the ground that it fails to clarify the precise constitutional\nstatus of the power exercised by the territorial courts. Lawson, Territo-\nrial Governments and the Limits of Formalism, 78 Cal. L. Rev. 853, 892\n(1990) (criticizing it as “fatuous” dictum). On the one hand, some early\nevidence suggests that the courts were thought to be dealing primarily\nwith local matters that lie beyond federal judicial cognizance. Pfander,\nArticle I Tribunals, Article III Courts, and the Judicial Power of the\nUnited States, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 643, 706–711 (2004). Yet Canter\ninvolved a controversy indisputably capable of adjudication by Article\nIII courts, because it both arose in admiralty and fell within the Su-\npreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction. Pfander, supra, at 713–714, n.\n314. The best explanation for this apparent tension is that territorial\ncourts adjudicate matters that Congress may or may not assign to\nArticle III courts, as it wishes. Nelson, Adjudication in the Political\nBranches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 575–576 (2007). To recognize\nCongress’ discretion requires no distortion of the meaning of judicial\npower because Chief Justice Marshall’s reasoning has nothing to do\nwith the intrinsic qualities of the adjudication itself—e.g., whether it\ninvolves “the stuff of the traditional actions at common law tried by the\n8         WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nadjudication of cases arising in the Armed Forces in non-\nArticle III courts-martial, inferring from a constellation of\nconstitutional provisions that Congress has the power to\nprovide for the adjudication of disputes among the Armed\nForces it creates and that Article III extends only to civil-\nian judicial power. Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65, 78–79\n(1858). Whatever their historical validity, these prece-\ndents exempt cases arising in the territories and in the\nland and naval forces from Article III because of other\nprovisions of the Constitution, not because of the defini-\ntion of judicial power in Article III itself. See Nelson,\nAdjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev.\n559, 576 (2007) (noting that both exceptions enjoy “special\ntextual rationales that d[o] not spill over into other\nareas”).\n   The third category consists of so-called “public rights”\ncases. Unlike the other two categories, which reflect\ncarve-outs from the core of the judicial power, this cate-\ngory describes cases outside of that core and therefore has\nmore to tell us about the scope of the judicial power.\n   The distinction between disputes involving “public\nrights” and those involving “private rights” is longstand-\ning, but the contours of the “public rights” doctrine have\nbeen the source of much confusion and controversy. See\ngenerally Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 66–70 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.) (tracing the evolution of the doctrine). Our\ncases attribute the doctrine to this Court’s mid-19th cen-\ntury decision, Murray’s Lessee, supra. In that case, the\nCourt observed that there are certain cases addressing\n“public rights, which may be presented in such form that\nthe judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which\nare susceptible of judicial determination, but which con-\ngress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the\n—————— \n\ncourts of Westminster in 1789,” Stern v.

Smith, 4 Wend. 9, 21 (N. Y. 1829) (Walworth, C.).\nThis distinction is significant to our understanding of\nArticle III, for while the legislative and executive branches\nmay dispose of public rights at will—including through\nnon-Article III adjudications—an exercise of the judicial\npower is required “when the government want[s] to act\nauthoritatively upon core private rights that had vested in\na particular individual.” Nelson, supra, at 569; see B&B\nHardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., ante, at 11\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   The distinction was well known at the time of the found-\ning. In the tradition of John Locke, William Blackstone in\nhis Commentaries identified the private rights to life,\nliberty, and property as the three “absolute” rights—so\ncalled because they “appertain[ed] and belong[ed] to par-\nticular men . . . merely as individuals,” not “to them as\nmembers of society [or] standing in various relations to\neach other”—that is, not dependent upon the will of the\ngovernment. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 119 (1765) (Commentaries); see also Nelson,\nsupra, at 567.3 Public rights, by contrast, belonged to “the\nwhole community, considered as a community, in its social\naggregate capacity.” 4 Commentaries 5 (1769); see also\nNelson, supra, at 567.

L. Rev. 401, 413\n(1958).\n   The Founders carried this idea forward into the Vesting\nClauses of our Constitution. Those Clauses were under-\nstood to play a role in ensuring that the federal courts\nalone could act to deprive individuals of private rights\nbecause the power to act conclusively against those rights\nwas the core of the judicial power. As one early treatise\nexplained, the judiciary is “that department of the gov-\nernment to whom the protection of the rights of the indi-\nvidual is by the constitution especially confided.” 1 St.\nGeorge Tucker, Blackstone’s Commentaries, App. 357\n(1803). If “public rights” were not thought to fall within\nthe core of the judicial power, then that could explain why\nCongress would be able to perform or authorize non-\nArticle III adjudications of public rights without trans-\ngressing Article III’s Vesting Clause.\n   Nineteenth-century American jurisprudence confirms\nthat an exercise of the judicial power was thought to be\nnecessary for the disposition of private, but not public,\nrights.4 See B&B Hardware, ante, at 12. The treatment of\n——————\n   4 Contemporary state-court decisions provide even more explication of\n\nthe distinction between public and private rights, and many expressly\ntie the distinction to the separation of powers. See, e.g., Newland v.\nMarsh, 19 Ill. 376, 383 (1857) (“The legislative power . . . cannot di-\nrectly reach the property or vested rights of the citizen, by providing for\ntheir forfeiture or transfer to another, without trial and judgment in\nthe courts; for to do so, would be the exercise of a power which belongs\nto another branch of the government, and is forbidden to the legisla-\nture”); see also Gaines v.

See generally Nelson, 107 Colum. L. Rev., at\n577–578 (discussing land patents).         That differential\ntreatment reflected the fact that, once “legal title passed\nout of the United States,” the patent “[u]ndoubtedly”\nconstituted “a vested right” and consequently could “only\nbe divested according to law.” Johnson v. Towsley, 13\nWall. 72, 84–85 (1871). By contrast, a party who sought to\nprotect only a “public right” in the land had no such vested\nright and could not invoke the intervention of Article III\ncourts. See Smelting Co. v. Kemp, 104 U. S. 636, 647\n(1882) (“It does not lie in the mouth of a stranger to the\ntitle to complain of the act of the government with respect\nto it”); see also Bagnell v. Broderick, 13 Pet. 436, 450\n(1839) (refusing to examine the propriety of a land patent\non the ground that “Congress has the sole power to declare\nthe dignity and effect of titles emanating from the United\nStates”).\n   Over time, the line between public and private rights\nhas blurred, along with the Court’s treatment of the\njudicial power. See B&B Hardware, ante, at 9–10, 12.\nThe source of the confusion may be Murray’s Lessee—the\nputative source of the public rights doctrine itself. Dic-\ntum in the case muddles the distinction between private\nand public rights, and the decision is perhaps better\nread as an expression of the principle of sovereign im-\nmunity. Granfinanciera, 492 U. S., at 68–69 (opinion of\n\n——————\nof person between private parties is judicial, and can only be conferred\non the courts”); see generally T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 175\n(1868) (explaining that only the judicial power was thought capable of\ndisposing of private rights).\n12         WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nSCALIA, J.).5 Some cases appear to have done just that,\nthus reading Murray’s Lessee to apply only in disputes\narising between the Government and others. See, e.g.,\nCrowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50 (1932).\n   Another strain of cases has confused the distinction\nbetween private and public rights, with some cases treat-\ning public rights as the equivalent of private rights enti-\ntled to full judicial review, American School of Magnetic\nHealing v. McAnnulty, 187 U. S. 94, 108 (1902), and\nothers treating what appear to be private rights as public\nrights on which executive action could be conclusive, see,\ne.g., Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U. S.\n381, 401–404 (1940); see also B&B Hardware, ante, at 12\n(observing that Sunshine Anthracite may reflect a unique\nhistorical exception for tax cases). Cf. Northern Pipeline,\n458 U. S., at 84–85 (plurality opinion) (discussing other\ncases that appear to reflect the historical distinction\nbetween private rights and rights created by Congress).\nPerhaps this confusion explains why the Court has more\nrecently expanded the concept of public rights to include\nany right “so closely integrated into a public regulatory\nscheme as to be a matter appropriate for agency resolu-\ntion with limited involvement by the Article III judici-\nary.” Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products\nCo., 473 U. S. 568, 593–594 (1985). A return to the\n——————\n  5 Another potential explanation is that Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken\n\nLand & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272 (1856), recognized yet another\nspecial exception to Article III’s allocation of judicial power, applicable\nwhenever the Government exercises its power of taxation. Nelson,\nAdjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 588–\n589 (2007); see also B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc.,\nante, at 12 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (discussing other decisions that\nappear to rest on this exception). To the extent that Murray’s Lessee\npurported to recognize such an exception, how-ever, it did so only in\ndictum after noting that the statute provided a mechanism for judicial\nreview of the accounting decision on which the distress warrant was\nbased. 18 How., at 280–281.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nhistorical understanding of “public rights,” however, would\nlead to the conclusion that the inalienable core of the\njudicial power vested by Article III in the federal courts is\nthe power to adjudicate private rights disputes.\n                              2\n  Although Congress did not enact a permanent federal\nbankruptcy law until the late 19th century, it has as-\nsigned the adjudication of certain bankruptcy disputes to\nnon-Article III actors since as early as 1800. Plank, Why\nBankruptcy Judges Need Not and Should Not Be Article\nIII Judges, 72 Am. Bankr. L. J. 567, 608 (1998) (describing\nthe bankruptcy powers vested by Congress in non-Article\nIII judges). Modern bankruptcy courts, however, adjudi-\ncate a far broader array of disputes than their earliest\nhistorical counterparts. And this Court has remained\ncarefully noncommittal about the source of their authority\nto do so. See Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 71 (plurality\nopinion).\n  Applying the historical categories of cases discussed\nabove, one can understand why. Bankruptcy courts clearly\ndo not qualify as territorial courts or courts-martial, but\nthey are not an easy fit in the “public rights” category,\neither. No doubt certain aspects of bankruptcy involve\nrights lying outside the core of the judicial power. The\nmost obvious of these is the right to discharge, which a\nparty may obtain if he satisfies certain statutory criteria.\nIbid. Discharge is not itself a private right, but, together\nwith the claims allowance process that precedes it, it can\nact conclusively on the core private rights of the debtor’s\ncreditors. We have nevertheless implicitly recognized that\nthe claims allowance process may proceed in a bankruptcy\ncourt, as can any matter that would necessarily be re-\nsolved by that process, even one that affects core private\nrights. Stern, 564 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 30–31).\nFor this reason, bankruptcy courts and their prede-\n14       WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncessors more likely enjoy a unique, textually based excep-\ntion, much like territorial courts and courts-martial do.\nSee id., at ___ (SCALIA, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).\nThat is, Article I’s Bankruptcy Clause serves to carve\ncases and controversies traditionally subject to resolution\nby bankruptcy commissioners out of Article III, giving\nCongress the discretion, within those historical bounda-\nries, to provide for their resolution outside of Article III\ncourts.\n                              3\n   Because Stern claims by definition fall outside of the\nhistorical boundaries of the bankruptcy carve-out, they are\nsubject to Article III. This means that, if their adjudica-\ntion requires the exercise of the judicial power, then only\nArticle III courts may perform it.\n   Although Stern claims indisputably involve private\nrights, the “public rights” doctrine suggests a way in\nwhich party consent may transform the function of adjudi-\ncating Stern claims into one that does not require the\nexercise of the judicial power. The premise of the “public\nrights” doctrine, as described above, is not that public\nrights affirmatively require adjudication by some other\ngovernmental power, but that the Government has a freer\nhand when private rights are not at issue. Accordingly,\nthis premise may not require the presence of a public right\nat all, but may apply equally to any situation in which\nprivate rights are not asserted.\n   Party consent, in turn, may have the effect of lifting that\n“private rights” bar, much in the way that waiver lifts the\nbar imposed by the right to a jury trial. Individuals may\ndispose of their own private rights freely, without judicial\nintervention. A party who consents to adjudication of a\nStern claim by a bankruptcy court is merely making a\nconditional surrender of whatever private right he has on\nthe line, contingent on some future event—namely, that\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            15\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe bankruptcy court rules against him. Indeed, it is on\nthis logic that the law has long encouraged and permitted\nprivate settlement of disputes, including through the\naction of an arbitrator not vested with the judicial power.\nSee ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 399\n(1868). Perhaps for this reason, decisions discussing the\nrelationship between private rights and the judicial power\nhave emphasized the “involuntary divestiture” of a private\nright. Newland v. Marsh, 19 Ill. 376, 382–383 (1857)\n(emphasis added).\n   But all of this does not necessarily mean that the major-\nity has wound up in the right place by the wrong path.\nEven if consent could lift the private-rights barrier to non-\njudicial Government action, it would not necessarily follow\nthat consent removes the Stern adjudication from the core\nof the judicial power. There may be other aspects of the\nadjudication that demand the exercise of the judicial\npower, such as entry of a final judgment enforceable with-\nout any further action by an Article III court. We have\nrecognized that judgments entered by Article III courts\nbear unique qualities that spring from the exercise of the\njudicial power, Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S.\n211, 218–219 (1995), and it may be that the entry of a\nfinal judgment bearing these qualities—irrespective of the\nsubject matter of the dispute—is a quintessential judicial\nfunction. See ante, at 16–17 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting).\nSee generally Northern Pipeline, supra, at 85–86, and n.\n38 (plurality opinion) (distinguishing the agency orders at\nissue in Crowell from bankruptcy court orders on this\nground). As Thomas Cooley explained in his influential\ntreatise, “If the judges should sit to hear . . . controversies\n[beyond their cognizance], they would not sit as a court; at\nthe most they would be arbitrators only, and their . . .\ndecision could not be binding as a judgment, but only as\n16         WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nan award.” Cooley, supra, at 399.6\n  Ultimately, this case implicates difficult questions about\nthe nature of bankruptcy procedure, judicial power, and\nremedies. In particular, if we were to determine that\ncurrent practice accords bankruptcy court judgments a\nfeature that demands the exercise of the judicial power,\nwould that mean that all bankruptcy judgments resolving\nStern claims are void, or only that courts may not give\neffect to that single feature that triggers Article III? The\nparties have briefed none of these issues, so I do not re-\nsolve them. But the number and magnitude of these\nimportant questions—questions implicated by thousands\nof bankruptcy and magistrate judge decisions each year—\nmerit closer attention than the majority has given them.\n\n——————\n  6 Numerous 19th-century State Supreme Courts held unconstitutional\n\nlaws authorizing individuals to consent to have their cases heard by an\nindividual not qualified as a judge under provisions of State Consti-\ntutions similar to Article III, §1. See, e.g., Winchester v. Ayres, 4 Iowa\n104 (1853); Haverly Invincible Mining Co. v. Howcutt, 6 Colo. 574, 575–\n576 (1883); Ex parte Alabama State Bar Assn., 92 Ala. 113, 8 So. 768\n(1891); see also Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, at 399. Acknowl-\nedging the similarity between the practices under review and the\nlegitimate practice of private arbitration, many of these decisions\npremised their finding of unconstitutionality on the issuance of a\njudgment or other writ that only judges may issue. See, e.g., Bishop v.\nNelson, 83 Ill. 601 (1876) (per curiam) (“This was not an arbitration . . .\nbut it was an attempt to confer upon [Mr. Wood] the power of a judge,\nto decide the pending case, and he did decide it, the court carrying out\nhis decision by entering the judgment he had reached, and not [its] own\njudgment”); Van Slyke v. Trempealeau Cty. Farmers’ Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,\n39 Wis. 390, 393 (1876) (“We cannot look into the bill of exceptions or\nconsider the order denying a new trial, because both are unofficial and\ndevoid of judicial authority”); see also id., at 395–396 (tracing this rule\nback to English understandings of judicial power). These decisions\ntreat the rule as a corollary to the rule that parties may not, by consent,\nconfer jurisdiction. See, e.g., Higby v. Ayres, 14 Kan. 331, 334 (1875);\nHoagland v. Creed, 81 Ill. 506, 507–508 (1876); see also Cooley, supra,\nat 399.\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

As instrumen-\ntalities of the Federal Government, the bankruptcy courts\nmust act pursuant to some constitutional grant of author-\nity. Even if the functions bankruptcy courts perform do not\nrequire an exercise of legislative, executive, or judicial\npower, we would need to identify the source of Congress’\nauthority to establish them and to authorize them to act.\n   The historical carve-outs for territorial courts and\ncourts-martial might provide some guidance. The Court\nhas anchored Congress’ authority to create territorial\ncourts in “the general right of sovereignty which exists in\nthe government, or in virtue of that clause which enables\nCongress to make all needful rules and regulations, re-\nspecting the territory belonging to the United States.”\nCanter, 1 Pet., at 546. And it has anchored Congress’\nauthority to create courts-martial in Congress’ Article I\npowers concerning the Army and Navy, understood along-\nside the Sixth Amendment’s exception of “ ‘cases arising in\nthe land or naval forces,’ ” from the grand jury require-\nment, and Article II’s requirement that the President\nserve as commander in chief. Dynes, 20 How., at 78–79.\n   Although our cases examining the constitutionality of\nstatutes allocating the power to the bankruptcy courts\nhave not considered the source of Congress’ authority to\nestablish them, the obvious textual basis is the fourth\nclause of Article I, §8, which empowers Congress to “estab-\nlish . . . uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies\nthroughout the United States.”7 But as with the other two\n——————\n  7 In Northern Pipeline, the plurality rejected the argument that “Con-\n\ngress’ constitutional authority to establish ‘uniform Laws on the subject\nof Bankruptcies throughout the United States’ carries with it an\n18         WELLNESS INT’L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nhistorical carve-outs, Congress’ power to establish tribu-\nnals within that grant is informed by historical under-\nstandings of the bankruptcy power.8 We have suggested\nthat, under this historical understanding, Congress has\nthe power to establish bankruptcy courts that exercise\njurisdiction akin to that of bankruptcy commissioners in\nEngland, subject to review traditionally had in England.\nAnte, at 3–4 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting). Although Stern\nclaims, by definition, lie outside those historical bounda-\nries, a historical practice of allowing broader adjudication\nby bankruptcy commissioners acting with the consent of\nthe parties could alter the analysis. The parties once\nagain do not brief these questions, but they merit closer\nattention by this Court.\n                        *     *    *\n   Whether parties may consent to bankruptcy court adju-\ndication of Stern claims is a difficult constitutional ques-\ntion. It turns on issues that are not adequately considered\nby the Court or briefed by the parties. And it cannot—and\nshould not—be resolved through a cursory reading of\nSchor, which itself is hardly a model of careful constitu-\ntional interpretation. For these reasons, I would resolve\n——————\ninherent power to establish legislative courts capable of adjudicating\n‘bankruptcy-related controversies.’ ” Northern Pipeline Constr.

In that context, however, it was considering whether\nArticle III imposes limits on Congress’ bankruptcy power, id., at 73,\nwhich is a distinct question from whether Congress has the power to\nestablish bankruptcy courts as an antecedent matter, leaving aside any\nArticle III limitations.\n   8 I would be wary of concluding that every grant of lawmaking au-\n\nthority to Congress includes the power to establish “legislative courts”\nas part of its legislative scheme. Some have suggested that Congress’\nauthority to establish tribunals pursuant to substantive grants of\nauthority is informed and limited by its Article I power to “constitute\nTribunals inferior to the supreme Court,” U.
