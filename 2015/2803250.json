CARTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12–1497. Argued January 13, 2015—Decided May 26, 2015\nPrivate parties may file civil qui tam actions to enforce the False\n  Claims Act (FCA), which prohibits making “a false or fraudulent\n  claim for payment or approval,” 31 U. S. C. §3729(a)(1), “to . . . the\n  United States,” 3729(b)(2)(A)(i). A qui tam action must generally be\n  brought within six years of a violation, §3731(b), but the Wartime\n  Suspension of Limitations Act (WSLA) suspends “the running of any\n  statute of limitations applicable to any offense” involving fraud\n  against the Federal Government. 18 U. S. C. §3287. Separately, the\n  FCA’s “first-to-file bar” precludes a qui tam suit “based on the facts\n  underlying [a] pending action,” §3730(b)(5).\n    In 2005, respondent worked for one of the petitioners, providing\n  logistical services to the United States military in Iraq. He subse-\n  quently filed a qui tam complaint (Carter I), alleging that petitioners,\n  who are defense contractors and related entities, had fraudulently\n  billed the Government for water purification services that were not\n  performed or not performed properly. In 2010, shortly before trial,\n  the Government informed the parties that an earlier-filed qui tam\n  suit (Thorpe) had similar claims, leading the District Court to dismiss\n  Carter I without prejudice under the first-to-file bar. While respond-\n  ent’s appeal was pending, Thorpe was dismissed for failure to prose-\n  cute. Respondent quickly filed a new complaint (Carter II), but the\n  court dismissed it under the first-to-file rule because Carter I’s appeal\n  was pending. Respondent then dismissed that appeal, and in June\n  2011, more than six years after the alleged fraud, filed the instant\n  complaint (Carter III). The District Court dismissed this complaint\n  with prejudice under the first-to-file rule because of a pending Mary-\n  land suit. Further, because the WSLA applies only to criminal\n2     KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v. UNITED\n                 STATES EX REL. CARTER\n\n                        Syllabus\n\n\n charges, the court reasoned, all but one of respondent’s civil actions\n were untimely. Reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the\n WSLA applied to civil claims and that the first-to-file bar ceases to\n apply once a related action is dismissed. Since any pending suits had\n by then been dismissed, the court held, respondent had the right to\n refile his case. It thus remanded Carter III with instructions to dis-\n miss without prejudice.\nHeld:\n    1. As shown by the WSLA’s text, structure, and history, the Act\n applies only to criminal offenses, not to civil claims like those in this\n case. Pp. 5–11.\n       (a) The 1921 and 1942 versions of the WSLA were enacted to\n address war-related fraud during, respectively, the First and Second\n World Wars. Both extended the statute of limitations for fraud of-\n fenses “now indictable under any existing statutes.” Since only\n crimes are “indictable,” these provisions quite clearly were limited to\n criminal charges. In 1944, Congress made the WSLA prospectively\n applicable to future wartime frauds rather than merely applicable to\n past frauds as earlier versions had been. In doing so, it deleted the\n phrase “now indictable under any statute,” so that the WSLA now\n applied to “any offense against the laws of the United States.” Con-\n gress made additional changes in 1948 and codified the WSLA in Ti-\n tle 18 U. S. C. Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) Section 3287’s text supports limiting the WSLA to criminal\n charges. The term “offense” is most commonly used to refer to\n crimes, especially given the WSLA’s location in Title 18, titled\n “Crimes and Criminal Procedure,” where no provision appears to em-\n ploy “offense” to denote a civil violation rather than a civil penalty at-\n tached to a criminal offense. And when Title 18 was enacted in 1948,\n its very first provision classified all offenses as crimes. In similar cir-\n cumstances, this Court has regarded a provision’s placement as rele-\n vant in determining whether its content is civil or criminal. Kansas\n v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 361. The WSLA’s history provides fur-\n ther support for this reading. The term “offenses” in the 1921 and\n 1942 statutes, the parties agree, applied only to crimes. And it is im-\n probable that the 1944 Act’s removal of the phrase “now indictable\n under any statute” had the effect of sweeping in civil claims, a fun-\n damental change in scope not typically accomplished with so subtle a\n move. The more plausible explanation is that Congress removed that\n phrase in order to change the WSLA from a retroactive measure de-\n signed to deal exclusively with past fraud into a permanent measure\n applicable to future fraud as well. If there were any ambiguity in the\n WSLA’s use of the term “offense,” that ambiguity should be resolved\n in favor of a narrower definition. See Bridges v. United States, 346\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  U. S. 209, 216. Pp. 7–11.\n    2. The FCA’s first-to-file bar keeps new claims out of court only\n  while related claims are still alive, not in perpetuity. Thus, dismissal\n  with prejudice was not called for in this case. This reading of\n  §3730(b)(5) is in accordance with the ordinary dictionary meaning of\n  the term “pending.” Contrary to petitioners’ reading, the term “pend-\n  ing” cannot be seen as a sort of “short-hand” for first-filed, which is\n  neither a lengthy nor a complex term. Petitioners’ reading would al-\n  so bar even a suit dismissed for a reason having nothing to do with\n  the merits, such as Thorpe, which was dismissed for failure to prose-\n  cute.

See United\nStates v. Smith, 342 U. S. 225, 228 (1952). “The False\nClaims Act was adopted in 1863 and signed into law by\nPresident Abraham Lincoln in order to combat rampant\nfraud in Civil War defense contracts.” S. Rep. No. 99–345,\np. 8 (1986). Predecessors of the Wartime Suspension of\nLimitations Act were enacted to address similar problems\nthat arose during the First and Second World Wars. See\nSmith, supra, at 228–229.\n  In this case, we must decide two questions regarding\nthose laws: first, whether the Wartime Suspension of\nLimitations Act applies only to criminal charges or also to\ncivil claims; second, whether the False Claims Act’s first-\nto-file bar keeps new claims out of court only while related\nclaims are still alive or whether it may bar those claims in\nperpetuity.\n2     KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v. UNITED\n                 STATES EX REL. CARTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   The False Claims Act (FCA) imposes liability on any\nperson who “knowingly presents . . . a false or fraudulent\nclaim for payment or approval,” 31 U. S. C. §3729(a)(1)(A),\n“to an officer or employee of the United States,”\n3729(b)(2)(A)(i). The FCA may be enforced not just\nthrough litigation brought by the Government itself, but\nalso through civil qui tam actions that are filed by private\nparties, called relators, “in the name of the Government.”\n§3730(b).\n   In a qui tam suit under the FCA, the relator files a\ncomplaint under seal and serves the United States with a\ncopy of the complaint and a disclosure of all material\nevidence. §3730(b)(2). After reviewing these materials,\nthe United States may “proceed with the action, in which\ncase the action shall be conducted by the Government,” or\nit may “notify the court that it declines to take over the\naction, in which case the person bringing the action shall\nhave the right to conduct the action.” §3730(b)(4). Re-\ngardless of the option that the United States selects, it\nretains the right at any time to dismiss the action entirely,\n§3730(c)(2)(A), or to settle the case, §3730(c)(2)(B).\n   The FCA imposes two restrictions on qui tam suits that\nare relevant here. One, the “first-to-file” bar, precludes a\nqui tam suit “based on the facts underlying [a] pending\naction.” §3730(b)(5) (emphasis added). The other, the\nFCA’s statute of limitations provision, states that a\nqui tam action must be brought within six years of a viola-\ntion or within three years of the date by which the United\nStates should have known about a violation. In no cir-\ncumstances, however, may a suit be brought more than 10\nyears after the date of a violation. §3731(b).\n                          B\n    The Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act (WSLA)\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

C. §3287. Before 2008, this provision was activated\nonly “[w]hen the United States [was] at war.” Ibid. (2006\ned.). In 2008, however, this provision was made to apply\nas well whenever Congress has enacted “a specific author-\nization for the use of the Armed Forces, as described in\nsection 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C.\n1544(b)).” Ibid. (2012 ed.).\n                              II\n  Petitioners are defense contractors and related entities\nthat provided logistical services to the United States\nmilitary during the armed conflict in Iraq. From January\nto April 2005, respondent worked in Iraq for one of the\npetitioners as a water purification operator. He subse-\nquently filed a qui tam complaint against petitioners\n(Carter I), alleging that they had fraudulently billed the\nGovernment for water purification services that were not\nperformed or not performed properly. The Government\ndeclined to intervene.\n  In 2010, shortly before trial, the Government informed\nthe parties about an earlier filed qui tam lawsuit, United\nStates ex rel. Thorpe v. Halliburton Co., No. 05–cv–08924\n(CD Cal., filed Dec. 23, 2005), that arguably contained\nsimilar claims. This initiated a remarkable sequence of\ndismissals and filings.\n  The District Court held that respondent’s suit was\nrelated to Thorpe and thus dismissed his case without\nprejudice under the first-to-file bar. Respondent appealed,\nand while his appeal was pending, Thorpe was dismissed\nfor failure to prosecute. Respondent quickly filed a new\ncomplaint (Carter II), but the District Court dismissed this\nsecond complaint under the first-to-file rule because re-\nspondent’s own earlier case was still pending on appeal.\nRespondent then voluntarily dismissed this appeal, and in\n4    KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v. UNITED\n                STATES EX REL. CARTER\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nJune 2011, more than six years after the alleged fraud, he\nfiled yet another complaint (Carter III ), and it is this\ncomplaint that is now at issue.\n   Petitioners sought dismissal of this third complaint\nunder the first-to-file rule, pointing to two allegedly related\ncases, one in Maryland and one in Texas, that had been\nfiled in the interim between the filing of Carter I and\nCarter III. This time, the court dismissed respondent’s\ncomplaint with prejudice. The court held that the latest\ncomplaint was barred under the first-to-file rule because\nthe Maryland suit was already pending when that com-\nplaint was filed. The court also ruled that the WSLA\napplies only to criminal charges and thus did not suspend\nthe time for filing respondent’s civil claims. As a result,\nthe court concluded, all but one of those claims were un-\ntimely because they were filed more than six years after\nthe alleged wrongdoing.\n   The Fourth Circuit reversed, rejecting the District\nCourt’s analysis of both the WSLA and first-to-file issues.\nUnited States ex rel. Carter v. Halliburton Co., 710 F. 3d\n171 (2013). Concluding that the WSLA applies to civil\nclaims based on fraud committed during the conflict in\nIraq,1 the Court of Appeals held that respondent’s claims\nhad been filed on time. The Court of Appeals also held\nthat the first-to-file bar ceases to apply once a related\naction is dismissed. Since the Maryland and Texas cases\nhad been dismissed by the time of the Fourth Circuit’s\ndecision, the court held that respondent had the right to\nrefile his case. The Court of Appeals thus remanded\nCarter III with instructions to dismiss without prejudice.\n——————\n  1 The Court of Appeals held that the Authorization for Use of Military\n\nForce Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, 116 Stat. 1498, note following 50\nU. S. C. §1541, p. 312, was sufficient to satisfy the “at war” requirement\nin the pre-2008 version of the WSLA. The Court of Appeals conse-\nquently found it unnecessary to decide whether the pre- or post-2008\nversion of the WSLA governed respondent’s claims.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  After this was done, respondent filed Carter IV, but the\nDistrict Court dismissed Carter IV on the ground that the\npetition for a writ of certiorari in Carter III (the case now\nbefore us) was still pending.\n  We granted that petition, 573 U. S. ___ (2014), and we\nnow reverse in part and affirm in part.\n                             III\n  The text, structure, and history of the WSLA show that\nthe Act applies only to criminal offenses.\n                               A\n   The WSLA’s roots extend back to the time after the end\nof World War I. Concerned about war-related frauds,\nCongress in 1921 enacted a statute that extended the\nstatute of limitations for such offenses. The new law\nprovided as follows: “[I]n offenses involving the defrauding\nor attempts to defraud the United States or any agency\nthereof . . . and now indictable under any existing statutes,\nthe period of limitations shall be six years.” Act of\nNov. 17, 1921, ch. 124, 42 Stat. 220 (emphasis added). Since\nonly crimes are “indictable,” this provision quite clearly\nwas limited to the filing of criminal charges.\n   In 1942, after the United States entered World War II,\nCongress enacted a similar suspension statute. This law,\nlike its predecessor, applied to fraud “offenses . . . now\nindictable under any existing statutes,” but this time the\nlaw suspended “any” “existing statute of limitations” until\nthe fixed date of June 30, 1945. Act of Aug. 24, 1942, ch.\n555, 56 Stat. 747–748.\n   As that date approached, Congress decided to adopt a\nsuspension statute which would remain in force for the\nduration of the war. Congress amended the 1942 WSLA\nin three important ways. First, Congress deleted the\nphrase “now indictable under any statute,” so that the\nWSLA was made to apply simply to “any offense against\n6      KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v. UNITED\n                  STATES EX REL. CARTER\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe laws of the United States.” 58 Stat. 667. Second,\nalthough previous versions of the WSLA were of definite\nduration, Congress now suspended the limitations period\nfor the open-ended timeframe of “three years after the\ntermination of hostilities in the present war as proclaimed\nby the President or by a concurrent resolution of the two\nHouses of Congress.” Ibid. Third, Congress expanded the\nstatute’s coverage beyond offenses “involving defrauding\nor attempts to defraud the United States” to include other\noffenses pertaining to Government contracts and the\nhandling and disposal of Government property. Ibid., and\n§28, 58 Stat. 781.\n  Congress made more changes in 1948. From then until\n2008, the WSLA’s relevant language was as follows:\n         “When the United States is at war the running of\n       any statute of limitations applicable to any offense (1)\n       involving fraud or attempted fraud against the United\n       States or any agency thereof in any manner, whether\n       by conspiracy or not . . . shall be suspended until three\n       years after the termination of hostilities as proclaimed\n       by the President or by a concurrent resolution of Con-\n       gress.” Act of June 25, 1948, §3287, 62 Stat. 828.\nIn addition, Congress codified the WSLA in Title 18 of\nthe United States Code, titled “Crimes and Criminal\nProcedure.”\n   Finally, in 2008, Congress once again amended the\nWSLA, this time in two relevant ways. First, as noted,\nCongress changed the Act’s triggering event, providing\nthat tolling is available not only “[w]hen the United States\nis at war,” but also when Congress has enacted a specific\nauthorization for the use of military force. Second, Con-\ngress extended the suspension period from three to five\nyears. §855, 122 Stat. 4545.2\n——————\n    2 The   claims giving rise to the present suit originated in 2005, but\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   With this background in mind, we turn to the question\nwhether the WSLA applies to civil claims as well as crimi-\nnal charges. We hold that the Act applies only to the\nlatter.\n   We begin with the WSLA’s text. The WSLA suspends\n“the running of any statute of limitations applicable to any\noffense . . . involving fraud or attempted fraud against the\nUnited States or any agency thereof.” 18 U. S. C. §3287\n(emphasis added). The term “offense” is most commonly\nused to refer to crimes. At the time of both the 1948 and\n2008 amendments to the Act, the primary definition of\n“offense” in Black’s Law Dictionary referred to crime.\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1110 (8th ed. 2004) (Black’s) (“A\nviolation of the law; a crime, often a minor one. See\nCRIME”); id., at 1232 (4th ed. 1951) (“A crime or misde-\nmeanor; a breach of the criminal laws”); id., at 1282 (3d\ned. 1933) (same). The 1942 edition of Webster’s similarly\nstates that “offense” “has no technical legal meaning; but\nit is sometimes used specifically for an indictable crime . . .\nand sometimes for a misdemeanor or wrong punishable\nonly by fine or penalty.” Webster’s New International\nDictionary 1690 (2d ed.). See also Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1566 (1976) (Webster’s Third)\n(“an infraction of law: CRIME, MISDEMEANOR”); American\nHeritage Dictionary 1255 (3d ed. 1992) (“A transgression\nof law; a crime”).\n   It is true that the term “offense” is sometimes used more\nbroadly. For instance, the 1948 edition of Ballentine’s\nLaw Dictionary cautions: “The words ‘crime’ and ‘offense’\nare not necessarily synonymous. All crimes are offenses,\nbut some offenses are not crimes.” Ballentine’s Law Dic-\n—————— \n\nrespondent filed the operative complaint in 2011. Resolution of the\n\nquestions before us in this case does not require us to decide which of \n\nthese two versions of the WSLA applies to respondent’s claims.\n\n8          KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v. UNITED \n\n                      STATES EX REL. CARTER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntionary 900.\n   But while the term “offense” is sometimes used in this\nway, that is not how the word is used in Title 18. Al-\nthough the term appears hundreds of times in Title 18,\nneither respondent nor the Solicitor General, appearing as\nan amicus in support of respondent, has been able to find\na single provision of that title in which “offense” is em-\nployed to denote a civil violation. The Solicitor General\ncites eight provisions,3 but not one actually labels a civil\nwrong as an “offense.” Instead, they all simply attach civil\npenalties to criminal offenses—as the Deputy Solicitor\nGeneral acknowledged at oral argument. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 28–29.\n   Not only is this pattern of usage telling, but when Title\n18 was enacted in 1948, the very first provision, what was\nthen 18 U.S.C. §1, classified all offenses as crimes. That\nprovision read in pertinent part as follows:\n       “§1. Offenses classified.\n         “Notwithstanding any Act of Congress to the\n       contrary:\n         “(1) Any offense punishable by death or imprison-\n       ment for a term exceeding one year is a felony.\n         “(2) Any other offense is a misdemeanor.” 62 Stat.\n       684 (repealed Oct. 12, 1984).\nThe Solicitor General correctly points out that regulatory\nprovisions outside Title 18 sometimes use the term “of-\nfense” to describe a civil violation, see Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 10 (United States Brief), but it is\nsignificant that Congress chose to place the WSLA in Title\n18. Although we have cautioned against “plac[ing] too\nmuch significance on the location of a statute in the Unit-\ned States Code,” Jones v. R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 541\nU.

S. 346, 361 (1997).\nIt is also revealing that Congress has used clearer and\nmore specific language when it has wanted to toll the\nstatutes of limitations for civil suits as well as crimes.\nOnly two months after enacting the WSLA, Congress\npassed a tolling statute for “violations of the antitrust\nlaws . . . now indictable or subject to civil proceedings.”\nAct of Oct. 10, 1942, ch. 589, 56 Stat. 781 (emphasis\nadded). Congress obviously could have included a similar\n“civil proceedings” clause in the WSLA, but it did not\ndo so.\n   The WSLA’s history provides what is perhaps the\nstrongest support for the conclusion that it applies only to\ncriminal charges. The parties do not dispute that the term\n“offenses” in the 1921 and 1942 suspension statutes ap-\nplied only to crimes, Brief for Petitioners 23; Brief for\nRespondent at 24–25, and after 1942, the WSLA continued\nto use that same term. The retention of the same term in\nthe later laws suggests that no fundamental alteration\nwas intended.\n   Respondent and the Government latch onto the 1944\nAct’s removal of the phrase “now indictable under any\nstatute” and argue that this deletion had the effect of\nsweeping in civil claims, but this argument is most im-\nprobable. Simply deleting the phrase “now indictable\nunder the statute,” while leaving the operative term “of-\nfense” unchanged would have been an obscure way of\nsubstantially expanding the WSLA’s reach. Fundamental\nchanges in the scope of a statute are not typically accom-\nplished with so subtle a move. Converting the WSLA from\na provision that suspended the statute of limitations for\ncriminal prosecutions into one that also suspended the\ntime for commencing a civil action would have been a big\nstep. If Congress had meant to make such a change, we\n10   KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v. UNITED\n                STATES EX REL. CARTER\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nwould expect it to have used language that made this\nimportant modification clear to litigants and courts.\n    Respondent’s and the Government’s interpretation of\nthe significance of the deletion of the phrase “now indict-\nable” ignores a more plausible explanation, namely, Con-\ngress’ decision to make the WSLA applicable, not just to\noffenses committed in the past during or in the aftermath\nof particular wars, but also to future offenses committed\nduring future wars. When the phrase “now indictable”\nfirst appeared in the 1921 Act, it meant that the statute of\nlimitations was suspended for only those crimes that had\nalready been committed when the Act took effect. This\nmade sense because the 1921 Act was a temporary meas-\nure enacted to deal with problems resulting from the First\nWorld War. The 1942 Act simply “readopt[ed] the [same]\nWorld War I policy” to deal with claims during World War\nII. Bridges v. United States, 346 U. S. 209, 219 (1953).\n    The 1944 amendments, however, changed the WSLA\nfrom a retroactive measure designed to deal exclusively\nwith past fraud into a measure applicable to future fraud\nas well. In order to complete this transformation, it was\nnecessary to remove the phrase “now indictable,” which, as\nnoted, limited the applicability of the suspension to offenses\ncommitted in the past. Thus, the removal of the “now\nindictable” provision was more plausibly driven by Con-\ngress’ intent to apply the WSLA prospectively, not by any\ndesire to expand the WSLA’s reach to civil suits. For all\nthese reasons, we think it clear that the term “offense” in\nthe WSLA applies solely to crimes.\n    But even if there were some ambiguity in the WSLA’s\nuse of that term, our cases instruct us to resolve that\nambiguity in favor of the narrower definition. We have\nsaid that the WSLA should be “narrowly construed” and\n“ ‘interpreted in favor of repose.’ ” Id., at 216 (quoting\nUnited States v. Scharton, 285 U. S. 518, 521–522 (1932).\nApplying that principle here means that the term “offense”\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)               11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nmust be construed to refer only to crimes. Because this\ncase involves civil claims, the WSLA does not suspend the\napplicable statute of limitations under either the 1948 or\nthe 2008 version of the statute.4\n                              IV\n   Petitioners acknowledge that respondent has raised\nother arguments that, if successful, could render at least\none claim timely on remand. We therefore consider\nwhether respondent’s claims must be dismissed with\nprejudice under the first-to-file rule. We conclude that\ndismissal with prejudice was not called for.\n   The first-to-file bar provides that “[w]hen a person\nbrings an action . . . no person other than the Government\nmay intervene or bring a related action based on the facts\nunderlying the pending action.” 31 U. S. C. §3730(b)(5)\n(emphasis added).           The term “pending” means\n“[r]emaining undecided; awaiting decision.” Black’s 1314\n(10th ed. 2014). See also Webster’s Third 1669 (1976)\n(defining “pending” to mean “not yet decided: in continu-\nance: in suspense”). If the reference to a “pending” action\nin the FCA is interpreted in this way, an earlier suit bars\na later suit while the earlier suit remains undecided but\nceases to bar that suit once it is dismissed. We see no\nreason not to interpret the term “pending” in the FCA in\naccordance with its ordinary meaning.\n   Petitioners argue that Congress used the term “pend-\ning” in a very different—and very peculiar—way. In the\nFCA, according to petitioners, the term “pending” “is ‘used\nas a short-hand for the first filed action.’ ” Brief for Peti-\ntioners 44. Thus, as petitioners see things, the first-filed\naction remains “pending” even after it has been dismissed,\nand it forever bars any subsequent related action.\n——————\n 4 This holding obviates any need to determine which version of the\n\nWSLA applies or whether the term “war” in the 1948 Act applies only\nwhen Congress has formally declared war.\n12   KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v. UNITED\n                STATES EX REL. CARTER\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  This interpretation does not comport with any known\nusage of the term “pending.” Under this interpretation,\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), is still “pend-\ning.” So is the trial of Socrates.\n  Petitioners say that Congress used the term “pending”\nin the FCA as a sort of “short-hand,” but a shorthand\nphrase or term is employed to provide a succinct way of\nexpressing a concept that would otherwise require a\nlengthy or complex formulation. Here, we are told that\n“pending” is shorthand for “first-filed,” a term that is\nneither lengthy nor complex. And if Congress had wanted\nto adopt the rule that petitioners favor, the task could\nhave been accomplished in other equally economical\nways—for example, by replacing “pending,” with “earlier”\nor “prior.”\n  Not only does petitioners’ argument push the term\n“pending” far beyond the breaking point, but it would\nlead to strange results that Congress is unlikely to have\nwanted. Under petitioners’ interpretation, a first-filed suit\nwould bar all subsequent related suits even if that earlier\nsuit was dismissed for a reason having nothing to do with\nthe merits. Here, for example, the Thorpe suit, which\nprovided the ground for the initial invocation of the first-\nto-file rule, was dismissed for failure to prosecute. Why\nwould Congress want the abandonment of an earlier suit\nto bar a later potentially successful suit that might result\nin a large recovery for the Government?\n  Petitioners contend that interpreting “pending” to mean\npending would produce practical problems, and there is\nsome merit to their arguments. In particular, as petition-\ners note, if the first-to-file bar is lifted once the first-filed\naction ends, defendants may be reluctant to settle such\nactions for the full amount that they would accept if there\nwere no prospect of subsequent suits asserting the same\nclaims. See Brief for Petitioners at 56–57. Respondent\nand the United States argue that the doctrine of claim\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

The False\nClaims Act’s qui tam provisions present many interpretive\nchallenges, and it is beyond our ability in this case to\nmake them operate together smoothly like a finely tuned\nmachine. We hold that a qui tam suit under the FCA\nceases to be “pending” once it is dismissed.

CARTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12–1497. Argued January 13, 2015—Decided May 26, 2015\nPrivate parties may file civil qui tam actions to enforce the False\n  Claims Act (FCA), which prohibits making “a false or fraudulent\n  claim for payment or approval,” 31 U. S. C. §3729(a)(1), “to . . . the\n  United States,” 3729(b)(2)(A)(i). A qui tam action must generally be\n  brought within six years of a violation, §3731(b), but the Wartime\n  Suspension of Limitations Act (WSLA) suspends “the running of any\n  statute of limitations applicable to any offense” involving fraud\n  against the Federal Government. 18 U. S. C. §3287. Separately, the\n  FCA’s “first-to-file bar” precludes a qui tam suit “based on the facts\n  underlying [a] pending action,” §3730(b)(5).\n    In 2005, respondent worked for one of the petitioners, providing\n  logistical services to the United States military in Iraq. He subse-\n  quently filed a qui tam complaint (Carter I), alleging that petitioners,\n  who are defense contractors and related entities, had fraudulently\n  billed the Government for water purification services that were not\n  performed or not performed properly. In 2010, shortly before trial,\n  the Government informed the parties that an earlier-filed qui tam\n  suit (Thorpe) had similar claims, leading the District Court to dismiss\n  Carter I without prejudice under the first-to-file bar. While respond-\n  ent’s appeal was pending, Thorpe was dismissed for failure to prose-\n  cute. Respondent quickly filed a new complaint (Carter II), but the\n  court dismissed it under the first-to-file rule because Carter I’s appeal\n  was pending. Respondent then dismissed that appeal, and in June\n  2011, more than six years after the alleged fraud, filed the instant\n  complaint (Carter III). The District Court dismissed this complaint\n  with prejudice under the first-to-file rule because of a pending Mary-\n  land suit. Further, because the WSLA applies only to criminal\n2     KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v. UNITED\n                 STATES EX REL. CARTER\n\n                        Syllabus\n\n\n charges, the court reasoned, all but one of respondent’s civil actions\n were untimely. Reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the\n WSLA applied to civil claims and that the first-to-file bar ceases to\n apply once a related action is dismissed. Since any pending suits had\n by then been dismissed, the court held, respondent had the right to\n refile his case. It thus remanded Carter III with instructions to dis-\n miss without prejudice.\nHeld:\n    1. As shown by the WSLA’s text, structure, and history, the Act\n applies only to criminal offenses, not to civil claims like those in this\n case. Pp. 5–11.\n       (a) The 1921 and 1942 versions of the WSLA were enacted to\n address war-related fraud during, respectively, the First and Second\n World Wars. Both extended the statute of limitations for fraud of-\n fenses “now indictable under any existing statutes.” Since only\n crimes are “indictable,” these provisions quite clearly were limited to\n criminal charges. In 1944, Congress made the WSLA prospectively\n applicable to future wartime frauds rather than merely applicable to\n past frauds as earlier versions had been. In doing so, it deleted the\n phrase “now indictable under any statute,” so that the WSLA now\n applied to “any offense against the laws of the United States.” Con-\n gress made additional changes in 1948 and codified the WSLA in Ti-\n tle 18 U. S. C. Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) Section 3287’s text supports limiting the WSLA to criminal\n charges. The term “offense” is most commonly used to refer to\n crimes, especially given the WSLA’s location in Title 18, titled\n “Crimes and Criminal Procedure,” where no provision appears to em-\n ploy “offense” to denote a civil violation rather than a civil penalty at-\n tached to a criminal offense. And when Title 18 was enacted in 1948,\n its very first provision classified all offenses as crimes. In similar cir-\n cumstances, this Court has regarded a provision’s placement as rele-\n vant in determining whether its content is civil or criminal. Kansas\n v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 361. The WSLA’s history provides fur-\n ther support for this reading. The term “offenses” in the 1921 and\n 1942 statutes, the parties agree, applied only to crimes. And it is im-\n probable that the 1944 Act’s removal of the phrase “now indictable\n under any statute” had the effect of sweeping in civil claims, a fun-\n damental change in scope not typically accomplished with so subtle a\n move. The more plausible explanation is that Congress removed that\n phrase in order to change the WSLA from a retroactive measure de-\n signed to deal exclusively with past fraud into a permanent measure\n applicable to future fraud as well. If there were any ambiguity in the\n WSLA’s use of the term “offense,” that ambiguity should be resolved\n in favor of a narrower definition. See Bridges v. United States, 346\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  U. S. 209, 216. Pp. 7–11.\n    2. The FCA’s first-to-file bar keeps new claims out of court only\n  while related claims are still alive, not in perpetuity. Thus, dismissal\n  with prejudice was not called for in this case. This reading of\n  §3730(b)(5) is in accordance with the ordinary dictionary meaning of\n  the term “pending.” Contrary to petitioners’ reading, the term “pend-\n  ing” cannot be seen as a sort of “short-hand” for first-filed, which is\n  neither a lengthy nor a complex term. Petitioners’ reading would al-\n  so bar even a suit dismissed for a reason having nothing to do with\n  the merits, such as Thorpe, which was dismissed for failure to prose-\n  cute.

See\nSmith, supra, at 228–229.\n  In this case, we must decide two questions regarding\nthose laws: first, whether the Wartime Suspension of\nLimitations Act applies only to criminal charges or also to\ncivil claims; second, whether the False Claims Act’s first-\nto-file bar keeps new claims out of court only while related\nclaims are still alive or whether it may bar those claims in\nperpetuity.\n2     KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v.

S. C. §3729(a)(1)(A),\n“to an officer or employee of the United States,”\n3729(b)(2)(A)(i). The FCA may be enforced not just\nthrough litigation brought by the Government itself, but\nalso through civil qui tam actions that are filed by private\nparties, called relators, “in the name of the Government.”\n§3730(b).\n   In a qui tam suit under the FCA, the relator files a\ncomplaint under seal and serves the United States with a\ncopy of the complaint and a disclosure of all material\nevidence. §3730(b)(2). After reviewing these materials,\nthe United States may “proceed with the action, in which\ncase the action shall be conducted by the Government,” or\nit may “notify the court that it declines to take over the\naction, in which case the person bringing the action shall\nhave the right to conduct the action.” §3730(b)(4). Re-\ngardless of the option that the United States selects, it\nretains the right at any time to dismiss the action entirely,\n§3730(c)(2)(A), or to settle the case, §3730(c)(2)(B).\n   The FCA imposes two restrictions on qui tam suits that\nare relevant here. One, the “first-to-file” bar, precludes a\nqui tam suit “based on the facts underlying [a] pending\naction.” §3730(b)(5) (emphasis added). The other, the\nFCA’s statute of limitations provision, states that a\nqui tam action must be brought within six years of a viola-\ntion or within three years of the date by which the United\nStates should have known about a violation. In no cir-\ncumstances, however, may a suit be brought more than 10\nyears after the date of a violation. §3731(b).\n                          B\n    The Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act (WSLA)\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

This time, the court dismissed respondent’s\ncomplaint with prejudice. The court held that the latest\ncomplaint was barred under the first-to-file rule because\nthe Maryland suit was already pending when that com-\nplaint was filed. The court also ruled that the WSLA\napplies only to criminal charges and thus did not suspend\nthe time for filing respondent’s civil claims. As a result,\nthe court concluded, all but one of those claims were un-\ntimely because they were filed more than six years after\nthe alleged wrongdoing.\n   The Fourth Circuit reversed, rejecting the District\nCourt’s analysis of both the WSLA and first-to-file issues.\nUnited States ex rel. Carter v. Halliburton Co., 710 F. 3d\n171 (2013). Concluding that the WSLA applies to civil\nclaims based on fraud committed during the conflict in\nIraq,1 the Court of Appeals held that respondent’s claims\nhad been filed on time. The Court of Appeals also held\nthat the first-to-file bar ceases to apply once a related\naction is dismissed. Since the Maryland and Texas cases\nhad been dismissed by the time of the Fourth Circuit’s\ndecision, the court held that respondent had the right to\nrefile his case. The Court of Appeals thus remanded\nCarter III with instructions to dismiss without prejudice.\n——————\n  1 The Court of Appeals held that the Authorization for Use of Military\n\nForce Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, 116 Stat. 1498, note following 50\nU. S. C. §1541, p. 312, was sufficient to satisfy the “at war” requirement\nin the pre-2008 version of the WSLA. The Court of Appeals conse-\nquently found it unnecessary to decide whether the pre- or post-2008\nversion of the WSLA governed respondent’s claims.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

Concerned about war-related frauds,\nCongress in 1921 enacted a statute that extended the\nstatute of limitations for such offenses. The new law\nprovided as follows: “[I]n offenses involving the defrauding\nor attempts to defraud the United States or any agency\nthereof . . . and now indictable under any existing statutes,\nthe period of limitations shall be six years.” Act of\nNov. 17, 1921, ch. 124, 42 Stat. 220 (emphasis added). Since\nonly crimes are “indictable,” this provision quite clearly\nwas limited to the filing of criminal charges.\n   In 1942, after the United States entered World War II,\nCongress enacted a similar suspension statute. This law,\nlike its predecessor, applied to fraud “offenses . . . now\nindictable under any existing statutes,” but this time the\nlaw suspended “any” “existing statute of limitations” until\nthe fixed date of June 30, 1945. Act of Aug. 24, 1942, ch.\n555, 56 Stat. 747–748.\n   As that date approached, Congress decided to adopt a\nsuspension statute which would remain in force for the\nduration of the war. Congress amended the 1942 WSLA\nin three important ways. First, Congress deleted the\nphrase “now indictable under any statute,” so that the\nWSLA was made to apply simply to “any offense against\n6      KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v. UNITED\n                  STATES EX REL. CARTER\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe laws of the United States.” 58 Stat. 667. Second,\nalthough previous versions of the WSLA were of definite\nduration, Congress now suspended the limitations period\nfor the open-ended timeframe of “three years after the\ntermination of hostilities in the present war as proclaimed\nby the President or by a concurrent resolution of the two\nHouses of Congress.” Ibid. Third, Congress expanded the\nstatute’s coverage beyond offenses “involving defrauding\nor attempts to defraud the United States” to include other\noffenses pertaining to Government contracts and the\nhandling and disposal of Government property. Ibid., and\n§28, 58 Stat. 781.\n  Congress made more changes in 1948. From then until\n2008, the WSLA’s relevant language was as follows:\n         “When the United States is at war the running of\n       any statute of limitations applicable to any offense (1)\n       involving fraud or attempted fraud against the United\n       States or any agency thereof in any manner, whether\n       by conspiracy or not . . . shall be suspended until three\n       years after the termination of hostilities as proclaimed\n       by the President or by a concurrent resolution of Con-\n       gress.” Act of June 25, 1948, §3287, 62 Stat. 828.\nIn addition, Congress codified the WSLA in Title 18 of\nthe United States Code, titled “Crimes and Criminal\nProcedure.”\n   Finally, in 2008, Congress once again amended the\nWSLA, this time in two relevant ways. First, as noted,\nCongress changed the Act’s triggering event, providing\nthat tolling is available not only “[w]hen the United States\nis at war,” but also when Congress has enacted a specific\nauthorization for the use of military force. Second, Con-\ngress extended the suspension period from three to five\nyears. §855, 122 Stat. 4545.2\n——————\n    2 The   claims giving rise to the present suit originated in 2005, but\n                     Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   With this background in mind, we turn to the question\nwhether the WSLA applies to civil claims as well as crimi-\nnal charges. We hold that the Act applies only to the\nlatter.\n   We begin with the WSLA’s text. The WSLA suspends\n“the running of any statute of limitations applicable to any\noffense . . . involving fraud or attempted fraud against the\nUnited States or any agency thereof.” 18 U. S. C. §3287\n(emphasis added). The term “offense” is most commonly\nused to refer to crimes. At the time of both the 1948 and\n2008 amendments to the Act, the primary definition of\n“offense” in Black’s Law Dictionary referred to crime.\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1110 (8th ed. 2004) (Black’s) (“A\nviolation of the law; a crime, often a minor one. See\nCRIME”); id., at 1232 (4th ed. 1951) (“A crime or misde-\nmeanor; a breach of the criminal laws”); id., at 1282 (3d\ned. 1933) (same). The 1942 edition of Webster’s similarly\nstates that “offense” “has no technical legal meaning; but\nit is sometimes used specifically for an indictable crime . . .\nand sometimes for a misdemeanor or wrong punishable\nonly by fine or penalty.” Webster’s New International\nDictionary 1690 (2d ed.). See also Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1566 (1976) (Webster’s Third)\n(“an infraction of law: CRIME, MISDEMEANOR”); American\nHeritage Dictionary 1255 (3d ed. 1992) (“A transgression\nof law; a crime”).\n   It is true that the term “offense” is sometimes used more\nbroadly. For instance, the 1948 edition of Ballentine’s\nLaw Dictionary cautions: “The words ‘crime’ and ‘offense’\nare not necessarily synonymous. All crimes are offenses,\nbut some offenses are not crimes.” Ballentine’s Law Dic-\n—————— \n\nrespondent filed the operative complaint in 2011. Resolution of the\n\nquestions before us in this case does not require us to decide which of \n\nthese two versions of the WSLA applies to respondent’s claims.\n\n8          KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v. UNITED \n\n                      STATES EX REL. CARTER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntionary 900.\n   But while the term “offense” is sometimes used in this\nway, that is not how the word is used in Title 18. Al-\nthough the term appears hundreds of times in Title 18,\nneither respondent nor the Solicitor General, appearing as\nan amicus in support of respondent, has been able to find\na single provision of that title in which “offense” is em-\nployed to denote a civil violation. The Solicitor General\ncites eight provisions,3 but not one actually labels a civil\nwrong as an “offense.” Instead, they all simply attach civil\npenalties to criminal offenses—as the Deputy Solicitor\nGeneral acknowledged at oral argument. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 28–29.\n   Not only is this pattern of usage telling, but when Title\n18 was enacted in 1948, the very first provision, what was\nthen 18 U.S.C. §1, classified all offenses as crimes. That\nprovision read in pertinent part as follows:\n       “§1. Offenses classified.\n         “Notwithstanding any Act of Congress to the\n       contrary:\n         “(1) Any offense punishable by death or imprison-\n       ment for a term exceeding one year is a felony.\n         “(2) Any other offense is a misdemeanor.” 62 Stat.\n       684 (repealed Oct. 12, 1984).\nThe Solicitor General correctly points out that regulatory\nprovisions outside Title 18 sometimes use the term “of-\nfense” to describe a civil violation, see Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 10 (United States Brief), but it is\nsignificant that Congress chose to place the WSLA in Title\n18. Although we have cautioned against “plac[ing] too\nmuch significance on the location of a statute in the Unit-\ned States Code,” Jones v. R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 541\nU. S. 369, 376 (2004), we have in similar circumstances\n——————\n    3 18   U. S. C. §§38; 248, 670, 1033(a), 1964, 2292(a), 2339B, 2339C.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nregarded the placement of a provision as relevant in de-\ntermining whether its content is civil or criminal in na-\nture, see Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 361 (1997).\nIt is also revealing that Congress has used clearer and\nmore specific language when it has wanted to toll the\nstatutes of limitations for civil suits as well as crimes.\nOnly two months after enacting the WSLA, Congress\npassed a tolling statute for “violations of the antitrust\nlaws . . . now indictable or subject to civil proceedings.”\nAct of Oct. 10, 1942, ch. 589, 56 Stat. 781 (emphasis\nadded). Congress obviously could have included a similar\n“civil proceedings” clause in the WSLA, but it did not\ndo so.\n   The WSLA’s history provides what is perhaps the\nstrongest support for the conclusion that it applies only to\ncriminal charges. The parties do not dispute that the term\n“offenses” in the 1921 and 1942 suspension statutes ap-\nplied only to crimes, Brief for Petitioners 23; Brief for\nRespondent at 24–25, and after 1942, the WSLA continued\nto use that same term. The retention of the same term in\nthe later laws suggests that no fundamental alteration\nwas intended.\n   Respondent and the Government latch onto the 1944\nAct’s removal of the phrase “now indictable under any\nstatute” and argue that this deletion had the effect of\nsweeping in civil claims, but this argument is most im-\nprobable. Simply deleting the phrase “now indictable\nunder the statute,” while leaving the operative term “of-\nfense” unchanged would have been an obscure way of\nsubstantially expanding the WSLA’s reach. Fundamental\nchanges in the scope of a statute are not typically accom-\nplished with so subtle a move. Converting the WSLA from\na provision that suspended the statute of limitations for\ncriminal prosecutions into one that also suspended the\ntime for commencing a civil action would have been a big\nstep. If Congress had meant to make such a change, we\n10   KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v. UNITED\n                STATES EX REL. CARTER\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nwould expect it to have used language that made this\nimportant modification clear to litigants and courts.\n    Respondent’s and the Government’s interpretation of\nthe significance of the deletion of the phrase “now indict-\nable” ignores a more plausible explanation, namely, Con-\ngress’ decision to make the WSLA applicable, not just to\noffenses committed in the past during or in the aftermath\nof particular wars, but also to future offenses committed\nduring future wars. When the phrase “now indictable”\nfirst appeared in the 1921 Act, it meant that the statute of\nlimitations was suspended for only those crimes that had\nalready been committed when the Act took effect. This\nmade sense because the 1921 Act was a temporary meas-\nure enacted to deal with problems resulting from the First\nWorld War. The 1942 Act simply “readopt[ed] the [same]\nWorld War I policy” to deal with claims during World War\nII. Bridges v. United States, 346 U. S. 209, 219 (1953).\n    The 1944 amendments, however, changed the WSLA\nfrom a retroactive measure designed to deal exclusively\nwith past fraud into a measure applicable to future fraud\nas well. In order to complete this transformation, it was\nnecessary to remove the phrase “now indictable,” which, as\nnoted, limited the applicability of the suspension to offenses\ncommitted in the past. Thus, the removal of the “now\nindictable” provision was more plausibly driven by Con-\ngress’ intent to apply the WSLA prospectively, not by any\ndesire to expand the WSLA’s reach to civil suits. For all\nthese reasons, we think it clear that the term “offense” in\nthe WSLA applies solely to crimes.\n    But even if there were some ambiguity in the WSLA’s\nuse of that term, our cases instruct us to resolve that\nambiguity in favor of the narrower definition. We have\nsaid that the WSLA should be “narrowly construed” and\n“ ‘interpreted in favor of repose.’ ” Id., at 216 (quoting\nUnited States v. Scharton, 285 U. S. 518, 521–522 (1932).\nApplying that principle here means that the term “offense”\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)               11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nmust be construed to refer only to crimes. Because this\ncase involves civil claims, the WSLA does not suspend the\napplicable statute of limitations under either the 1948 or\nthe 2008 version of the statute.4\n                              IV\n   Petitioners acknowledge that respondent has raised\nother arguments that, if successful, could render at least\none claim timely on remand. We therefore consider\nwhether respondent’s claims must be dismissed with\nprejudice under the first-to-file rule. We conclude that\ndismissal with prejudice was not called for.\n   The first-to-file bar provides that “[w]hen a person\nbrings an action . . . no person other than the Government\nmay intervene or bring a related action based on the facts\nunderlying the pending action.” 31 U. S. C. §3730(b)(5)\n(emphasis added).           The term “pending” means\n“[r]emaining undecided; awaiting decision.” Black’s 1314\n(10th ed. 2014). See also Webster’s Third 1669 (1976)\n(defining “pending” to mean “not yet decided: in continu-\nance: in suspense”). If the reference to a “pending” action\nin the FCA is interpreted in this way, an earlier suit bars\na later suit while the earlier suit remains undecided but\nceases to bar that suit once it is dismissed. We see no\nreason not to interpret the term “pending” in the FCA in\naccordance with its ordinary meaning.\n   Petitioners argue that Congress used the term “pend-\ning” in a very different—and very peculiar—way. In the\nFCA, according to petitioners, the term “pending” “is ‘used\nas a short-hand for the first filed action.’ ” Brief for Peti-\ntioners 44. Thus, as petitioners see things, the first-filed\naction remains “pending” even after it has been dismissed,\nand it forever bars any subsequent related action.\n——————\n 4 This holding obviates any need to determine which version of the\n\nWSLA applies or whether the term “war” in the 1948 Act applies only\nwhen Congress has formally declared war.\n12   KELLOGG BROWN & ROOT SERVICES, INC. v. UNITED\n                STATES EX REL. CARTER\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  This interpretation does not comport with any known\nusage of the term “pending.” Under this interpretation,\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), is still “pend-\ning.” So is the trial of Socrates.\n  Petitioners say that Congress used the term “pending”\nin the FCA as a sort of “short-hand,” but a shorthand\nphrase or term is employed to provide a succinct way of\nexpressing a concept that would otherwise require a\nlengthy or complex formulation. Here, we are told that\n“pending” is shorthand for “first-filed,” a term that is\nneither lengthy nor complex. And if Congress had wanted\nto adopt the rule that petitioners favor, the task could\nhave been accomplished in other equally economical\nways—for example, by replacing “pending,” with “earlier”\nor “prior.”\n  Not only does petitioners’ argument push the term\n“pending” far beyond the breaking point, but it would\nlead to strange results that Congress is unlikely to have\nwanted. Under petitioners’ interpretation, a first-filed suit\nwould bar all subsequent related suits even if that earlier\nsuit was dismissed for a reason having nothing to do with\nthe merits. Here, for example, the Thorpe suit, which\nprovided the ground for the initial invocation of the first-\nto-file rule, was dismissed for failure to prosecute. Why\nwould Congress want the abandonment of an earlier suit\nto bar a later potentially successful suit that might result\nin a large recovery for the Government?\n  Petitioners contend that interpreting “pending” to mean\npending would produce practical problems, and there is\nsome merit to their arguments. In particular, as petition-\ners note, if the first-to-file bar is lifted once the first-filed\naction ends, defendants may be reluctant to settle such\nactions for the full amount that they would accept if there\nwere no prospect of subsequent suits asserting the same\nclaims. See Brief for Petitioners at 56–57. Respondent\nand the United States argue that the doctrine of claim\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npreclusion may protect defendants if the first-filed action\nis decided on the merits, id., at 60–61; United States Brief\n30, but that issue is not before us in this case. The False\nClaims Act’s qui tam provisions present many interpretive\nchallenges, and it is beyond our ability in this case to\nmake them operate together smoothly like a finely tuned\nmachine. We hold that a qui tam suit under the FCA\nceases to be “pending” once it is dismissed.
